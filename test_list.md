# Test List Detection

## Problem Case
Knowledge Points Tested:
- Angular displacement ($\theta$), angular velocity ($\omega$), and angular acceleration ($\alpha$)
- Relationship between linear distance (arc length) and angular displacement: $S = R\theta$
- Kinematic equations for constant angular acceleration: $\theta = \omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2$ and $\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t$
- Tangential speed as the linear velocity of a point on the rim: $v = R\omega$
