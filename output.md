# angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration

## Problem 0
Background:
  This problem explores the rotational motion of a bicycle wheel. When a wheel rotates, every point on its rim moves with a linear speed that depends on its angular speed and the wheel's radius. Angular acceleration describes how quickly the angular velocity changes over time. 

  Key principles:
    - Linear speed ($v$) at the rim: $v = r \cdot \omega$, where $r$ is the wheel's radius and $\omega$ is the angular speed (rad/s).
    - Angular acceleration ($\alpha$) for constant acceleration: $\alpha = \frac{\omega_{\text{final}} - \omega_{\text{initial}}}{t}$, where $\omega_{\text{initial}}$ is the starting angular velocity, $\omega_{\text{final}}$ is the ending angular velocity, and $t$ is the time interval.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  - Relationship between linear and angular quantities ($v = r \cdot \omega$).
  - Definition and calculation of angular acceleration for constant acceleration.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  Connects to linear kinematics (velocity and acceleration) through rotational analogs, reinforcing the parallel structure between linear and rotational motion equations.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  Applies to mechanical engineering (design of rotating systems like wheels and gears) and transportation physics (bicycle dynamics).

Real-World Applications:
  Calculating angular acceleration is essential in designing braking systems for vehicles, optimizing performance in cycling sports, and analyzing rotational components in machinery.

Problem Statement:
  A bicycle wheel with a radius of $0.25  \text{m}$ starts from rest (initial angular velocity $\omega_{\text{initial}} = 0  \text{rad/s}$) and undergoes constant angular acceleration. After $4  \text{seconds}$, a point on the rim has a linear speed of $2.5  \text{m/s}$. Calculate the angular acceleration of the wheel.

  Express your answer in $\text{rad/s}^2$ and provide only the numerical value.

## Solution
Step 1: Determine the final angular velocity ($\omega_{\text{final}}$)  
Using the relationship between linear speed and angular speed:  

$$
v = r \cdot \omega_{\text{final}}
$$
  
Solve for $\omega_{\text{final}}$:  

$$
\omega_{\text{final}} = \frac{v}{r}
$$
  
Substitute the given values ($v = 2.5  \text{m/s}$, $r = 0.25  \text{m}$):  

$$
\omega_{\text{final}} = \frac{2.5}{0.25} = 10  \text{rad/s}
$$
  

Step 2: Calculate the angular acceleration ($\alpha$)  
Use the definition of constant angular acceleration:  

$$
\alpha = \frac{\omega_{\text{final}} - \omega_{\text{initial}}}{t}
$$
  
Substitute $\omega_{\text{initial}} = 0  \text{rad/s}$, $\omega_{\text{final}} = 10  \text{rad/s}$, and $t = 4  \text{s}$:  

$$
\alpha = \frac{10 - 0}{4} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5  \text{rad/s}^2
$$
  

The angular acceleration is $2.5  \text{rad/s}^2$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{2.5}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
Rotational kinematics describes the motion of objects undergoing circular movement. Key quantities include angular displacement (θ), angular velocity (ω), and angular acceleration (α). For constant angular acceleration, the angular displacement is related to time by θ = ω₀t + (1/2)αt², where ω₀ is initial angular velocity. The average angular velocity over any interval is defined as ω_avg = Δθ/Δt, where Δθ is the total angular displacement during time Δt. These principles apply to systems like rotating machinery, planetary motion, and amusement park rides.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Conversion between revolutions and radians (1 revolution = 2π radians)
2. Kinematic equations for rotational motion under constant acceleration
3. Definition of average angular velocity (ω_avg = Δθ/Δt)
4. Proportional reasoning for displacement under constant acceleration

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects rotational kinematics to linear kinematics through analogous equations (e.g., θ ↔ x, ω ↔ v, α ↔ a). It reinforces the concept that motion with constant acceleration exhibits quadratic time dependence in displacement.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Engineering: Used in designing rotating systems with controlled acceleration profiles. Astronomy: Models angular motion of celestial bodies during orbital maneuvers.

Real-World Applications:
Amusement park ride design (e.g., ensuring safe acceleration on carousels), industrial machinery (e.g., calculating spin-up times for turbines), and robotics (precise control of rotational joints).

Problem:
A merry-go-round starts from rest and accelerates uniformly. After 12 seconds, it has completed exactly 3 revolutions. Determine the average angular velocity over the first 6 seconds of its motion. Express your answer in rad/s as an exact simplified expression, and provide only the numerical coefficient in the box (omit units).

## Solution
**Step 1: Convert total displacement to radians**  
Total angular displacement in 12 seconds:  
$$ \theta_{\text{total}} = 3 \text{ rev} \times 2\pi \text{ rad/rev} = 6\pi \text{ radians} $$

**Step 2: Establish kinematic equation**  
Since the merry-go-round starts from rest (ω₀ = 0) and accelerates uniformly:  
$$ \theta_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} \alpha t_{\text{total}}^2 $$  
Substitute known values:  
$$ 6\pi = \frac{1}{2} \alpha (12)^2 $$  
$$ 6\pi = 72\alpha $$  
Solve for angular acceleration:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{6\pi}{72} = \frac{\pi}{12} \text{ rad/s}^2 $$

**Step 3: Calculate displacement in first 6 seconds**  
$$ \theta_1 = \frac{1}{2} \alpha t_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{12} \right) (6)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{12} \right) (36) = \frac{36\pi}{24} = \frac{3\pi}{2} \text{ radians} $$

**Step 4: Compute average angular velocity**  
$$ \omega_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{\theta_1}{t_1} = \frac{3\pi/2}{6} = \frac{3\pi}{12} = \frac{\pi}{4} \text{ rad/s} $$

**Alternative solution using proportional reasoning:**  
Under constant acceleration from rest, θ ∝ t². Thus:  
$$ \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_{\text{total}}} = \left( \frac{t_1}{t_{\text{total}}} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} $$  
$$ \theta_1 = \frac{1}{4} \times 6\pi = \frac{3\pi}{2} \text{ radians} $$  
Average angular velocity:  
$$ \omega_{\text{avg}} = \frac{3\pi/2}{6} = \frac{\pi}{4} \text{ rad/s} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
  When an object undergoes rotational motion with constant angular acceleration, its motion can be described by kinematic equations analogous to those in linear motion. The key equation relating angular displacement ($\theta$), initial angular velocity ($\omega_i$), final angular velocity ($\omega_f$), and angular acceleration ($\alpha$) is derived from the principle of conservation of energy and kinematics. This equation, $\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta$, is essential for solving problems involving rotational deceleration or acceleration without time as a variable. The radius of rotation does not appear in this angular relationship, as it is purely kinematic.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  - Application of rotational kinematics equations for constant angular acceleration.
  - Algebraic manipulation to solve for angular acceleration using angular velocities and displacement.
  - Interpretation of negative acceleration (deceleration) in rotational dynamics.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  This problem connects rotational kinematics to linear kinematics through analogous equations (e.g., $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta x$). It also reinforces the concept that angular quantities (displacement, velocity, acceleration) are independent of radius, while linear quantities depend on radius via $s = r\theta$, $v = r\omega$, and $a = r\alpha$.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  Rotational deceleration is critical in mechanical engineering (e.g., braking systems in vehicles) and physics (e.g., analyzing the spin-down of celestial bodies). The principles tested here also apply to robotics (joint motion control) and aerospace engineering (attitude adjustment of spacecraft).

Real-World Applications:
  Calculating the angular deceleration of a car tire helps engineers design effective braking systems. For example, the linear deceleration of the vehicle is derived from $a = r\alpha$, which impacts stopping distance and safety standards. Similar calculations are used in roller coaster design, flywheel energy storage, and industrial machinery.

Problem Statement:

  A car tire of radius $R = 0.3 \text{ m}$ is initially rotating at $20 \text{ rad/s}$. The driver applies the brakes, causing the tire to experience constant angular deceleration. During this braking, the tire rotates through an angular displacement of $2\pi \text{ radians}$ (one full revolution) and slows to an angular velocity of $5 \text{ rad/s}$.

  Find the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the tire. Express your answer as an exact symbolic expression in rad/s². Do not substitute numerical values for constants or include units in your final answer.

  Note: The radius $R$ is given but is not needed to solve for $\alpha$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify relevant equation**  
For constant angular acceleration, the kinematic equation relating angular velocities, displacement, and acceleration is:  
$$\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta$$

**Step 2: Solve for angular acceleration**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $\alpha$:  
$$\alpha = \frac{\omega_f^2 - \omega_i^2}{2\theta}$$

**Step 3: Substitute given values**  
- Initial angular velocity $\omega_i = 20 \text{ rad/s}$  
- Final angular velocity $\omega_f = 5 \text{ rad/s}$  
- Angular displacement $\theta = 2\pi \text{ radians}$  

Substitute these into the equation:  
$$\alpha = \frac{(5)^2 - (20)^2}{2 \cdot (2\pi)} = \frac{25 - 400}{4\pi} = \frac{-375}{4\pi}$$

**Step 4: Interpret and simplify**  
The negative sign indicates deceleration. The fraction $-\frac{375}{4\pi}$ is already simplified since 375 and 4 have no common factors (375 = $3 \times 5^3$, 4 = $2^2$).  
Thus, the angular acceleration is:  
$$\alpha = -\frac{375}{4\pi} \text{ rad/s}^2$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{-\dfrac{375}{4\pi}}$$

## Problem 3
**Background**  
Centrifuges are essential devices in scientific laboratories, medical facilities, and industrial settings. They separate mixtures by rapidly rotating samples, creating centrifugal forces that push denser components outward. Understanding the rotational kinematics of centrifuges—particularly how angular displacement evolves under acceleration—is critical for optimizing processes like blood component separation, chemical purification, and materials testing. This problem explores the fundamental principles of rotational motion using a centrifuge scenario.

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. **Definition of angular acceleration**: The rate of change of angular velocity, $\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}$.  
2. **Integration of angular velocity**: Deriving angular displacement $\theta$ from $\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}$.  
3. **Initial conditions**: Application of rest ($\omega_0 = 0$) at $t = 0$.  
4. **Constant acceleration kinematics**: Solving for $\theta$ under uniform $\alpha$.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
- Connects to linear kinematics (e.g., $s = \frac{1}{2}at^2$ for displacement under constant acceleration) through analogous rotational counterparts.  
- Reinforces calculus concepts (integration) applied to physical systems.  
- Bridges to dynamics (torque and moment of inertia) when analyzing causes of angular acceleration.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Bioengineering**: Centrifugal separation efficiency depends on precise angular displacement to isolate cellular components.  
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Motor control systems require accurate displacement predictions to regulate centrifuge operation.  
- **Chemistry**: Sample preparation in centrifuges relies on controlled rotational motion to partition substances.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Medical Diagnostics**: Blood centrifuges must achieve specific angular displacements to separate plasma from red blood cells.  
- **Aerospace**: Testing materials in centrifugal force simulators requires exact displacement calculations to mimic high-gravity conditions.  
- **Industrial Processing**: Centrifuges in wastewater treatment plants remove solids by spinning at displacements calibrated for target particle densities.  

**Problem Statement**  
A laboratory centrifuge rotor starts from rest ($\omega_0 = 0$) and accelerates uniformly at $\alpha = 15  \text{rad/s}^2$ for $T = 5  \text{s}$. Determine the total angular displacement $\theta$ (in radians) of the rotor during this period.  

Derive $\theta$ from first principles using the definitions of angular acceleration and angular velocity. Begin with $\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}$ and $\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}$, and integrate to find $\theta$ as a function of $\alpha$ and $T$.  

**Instructions for the Final Answer**  
- Provide only the numerical value of $\theta$ (without units), rounded to one decimal place if necessary.

## Solution
### Step 1: Define angular acceleration  
Given constant angular acceleration $\alpha$, the relationship with angular velocity $\omega$ is:  
$$\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}$$  

### Step 2: Integrate to find angular velocity $\omega(t)$  
Separate variables and integrate with initial condition $\omega(0) = 0$:  
$$\int_0^\omega d\omega = \int_0^t \alpha  dt$$  
$$\omega = \alpha t$$  

### Step 3: Define angular velocity  
Angular velocity relates to angular displacement $\theta$ by:  
$$\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}$$  
Substitute $\omega = \alpha t$:  
$$\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \alpha t$$  

### Step 4: Integrate to find angular displacement $\theta(t)$  
Separate variables and integrate with initial condition $\theta(0) = 0$:  
$$\int_0^\theta d\theta = \int_0^T \alpha t  dt$$  
$$\theta = \alpha \int_0^T t  dt$$  
$$\theta = \alpha \left[ \frac{t^2}{2} \right]_0^T$$  
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2} \alpha T^2$$  

### Step 5: Substitute given values  
$\alpha = 15  \text{rad/s}^2$, $T = 5  \text{s}$:  
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2} (15) (5)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (15) (25) = \frac{375}{2} = 187.5$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{187.5}$$

## Problem 4
Background:
In bicycle mechanics, understanding the relationship between rotational motion and linear motion is essential. When a bicycle wheel spins, points on the rim move with both angular velocity (rotation rate) and tangential speed (linear speed along the circular path). Consider a bicycle wheel mounted on a stationary stand, rotating with constant angular acceleration. At time $t = 0$, the wheel has an initial angular velocity $\omega_0$. After time $T$, a sensor on the rim records that it has traveled a total linear distance $S$ along its circular path. The wheel has radius $R$.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Angular displacement ($\theta$), angular velocity ($\omega$), and angular acceleration ($\alpha$)
- Relationship between linear distance (arc length) and angular displacement: $S = R\theta$
- Kinematic equations for constant angular acceleration: $\theta = \omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2$ and $\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t$
- Tangential speed as the linear velocity of a point on the rim: $v = R\omega$

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects rotational kinematics to linear kinematics, demonstrating how angular quantities (displacement, velocity, acceleration) correspond to linear quantities (arc length, tangential speed, tangential acceleration) via the radius $R$. It reinforces the analogies between linear and rotational motion equations.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The principles apply to engineering (e.g., designing gear systems), automotive technology (wheel dynamics), and physics (e.g., analyzing planetary motion where rotational and linear speeds are related).

Real-World Applications:
Bicycle tuning (measuring wheel speed under acceleration), roller coaster design (calculating car speeds on circular tracks), and industrial machinery (conveyor belt systems with rotating drums).

Problem:
A bicycle wheel of radius $R$ rotates with constant angular acceleration. At $t = 0$, it has an initial angular velocity $\omega_0$. After time $T$, a sensor on the rim measures a total linear distance traveled $S$. Derive an expression for the tangential speed $v$ of the rim at time $t = T$. Express $v$ symbolically in terms of $R$, $\omega_0$, $T$, and $S$ only. Do not include $\alpha$ in your final expression.

Format your answer as a single simplified expression. Use explicit multiplication symbols (e.g., $R \cdot \omega_0$) where needed for clarity.

## Solution
**Step 1: Relate linear distance to angular displacement**  
The linear distance $S$ traveled by a point on the rim is the arc length, given by:  
$$ S = R \theta $$  
where $\theta$ is the angular displacement. Solving for $\theta$:  
$$ \theta = \frac{S}{R} \quad (1) $$  

**Step 2: Apply kinematic equation for angular displacement**  
For constant angular acceleration $\alpha$, the angular displacement at time $T$ is:  
$$ \theta = \omega_0 T + \frac{1}{2} \alpha T^2 \quad (2) $$  
Substitute equation (1) into equation (2):  
$$ \frac{S}{R} = \omega_0 T + \frac{1}{2} \alpha T^2 \quad (3) $$  

**Step 3: Solve for angular acceleration $\alpha$**  
Rearrange equation (3) to isolate $\alpha$:  
$$ \frac{1}{2} \alpha T^2 = \frac{S}{R} - \omega_0 T $$  
$$ \alpha T^2 = 2 \left( \frac{S}{R} - \omega_0 T \right) $$  
$$ \alpha = \frac{2}{T^2} \left( \frac{S}{R} - \omega_0 T \right) = \frac{2S}{R T^2} - \frac{2 \omega_0}{T} \quad (4) $$  

**Step 4: Find angular velocity at time $T$**  
Using the kinematic equation for angular velocity:  
$$ \omega = \omega_0 + \alpha T \quad (5) $$  
Substitute $\alpha$ from equation (4) into equation (5):  
$$ \omega = \omega_0 + \left( \frac{2S}{R T^2} - \frac{2 \omega_0}{T} \right) T $$  
Simplify:  
$$ \omega = \omega_0 + \frac{2S}{R T} - 2 \omega_0 = -\omega_0 + \frac{2S}{R T} \quad (6) $$  

**Step 5: Derive tangential speed**  
The tangential speed $v$ is related to angular velocity by:  
$$ v = R \omega \quad (7) $$  
Substitute $\omega$ from equation (6) into equation (7):  
$$ v = R \left( -\omega_0 + \frac{2S}{R T} \right) $$  
Simplify:  
$$ v = -R \omega_0 + \frac{2S}{T} $$  
$$ v = \frac{2S}{T} - R \omega_0 $$  

**Conclusion**  
The tangential speed of the rim at time $t = T$ is $\frac{2S}{T} - R \omega_0$.

## Answer
$$ \boxed{\dfrac{2S}{T} - R \omega_0} $$

## Problem 5
### Background
In rotational motion, a flywheel is a mechanical device designed to store rotational energy. When a flywheel slows down, it experiences angular deceleration, which is the rate of decrease in angular velocity. This scenario involves constant angular acceleration (or deceleration), allowing the use of kinematic equations analogous to linear motion. The key equation relates angular displacement ($\theta$), initial angular velocity ($\omega_i$), final angular velocity ($\omega_f$), and angular acceleration ($\alpha$):

$$\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta$$

Angular displacement must be in radians for consistency with angular velocities in rad/s. Recall that 1 revolution = $2\pi$ radians. Angular deceleration is the magnitude of angular acceleration when rotation slows down.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**
- Conversion between revolutions and radians.
- Application of rotational kinematics with constant angular acceleration.
- Solving for angular acceleration using the kinematic equation $\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta$.
- Interpretation of angular deceleration as a positive scalar (magnitude of negative $\alpha$).

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**
This problem connects to linear kinematics ($v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta x$), highlighting parallels between translational and rotational dynamics. It also reinforces algebraic manipulation skills and unit conversions within physics.

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**
- **Engineering:** Flywheels are used in energy storage systems (e.g., regenerative braking in vehicles). Calculating deceleration rates is crucial for designing control systems.
- **Mathematics:** Solving for $\alpha$ involves rearranging equations and working with symbolic expressions, reinforcing algebra.

**Real-World Applications:**
- Industrial flywheels in engines or generators must decelerate controllably to avoid damage.
- Gyroscopes in navigation systems rely on precise angular motion analysis.

### Problem Statement
A flywheel initially rotates at 12 rad/s and decelerates uniformly to 4 rad/s while completing 50 revolutions. Calculate the angular deceleration (magnitude of angular acceleration) of the flywheel.  

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $\pi$. The final answer must be a positive value representing the magnitude of deceleration. Units are rad/s².

**Note:**  
- Angular deceleration is defined as the absolute value of angular acceleration ($|\alpha|$).
- Use the exact form; do not substitute numerical values for constants.

## Solution
### Step-by-Step Solution

**Given:**  
- Initial angular velocity, $\omega_i = 12$ rad/s  
- Final angular velocity, $\omega_f = 4$ rad/s  
- Angular displacement, $\theta = 50$ revolutions  

**Step 1: Convert angular displacement to radians**  
Since 1 revolution = $2\pi$ radians,  
$$  
\theta = 50 \times 2\pi = 100\pi \text{ radians}.  
$$  

**Step 2: Apply the rotational kinematics equation**  
The equation relating velocities, displacement, and acceleration is:  
$$  
\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta.  
$$  
Substitute the known values:  
$$  
(4)^2 = (12)^2 + 2\alpha(100\pi).  
$$  
This simplifies to:  
$$  
16 = 144 + 200\pi\alpha.  
$$  

**Step 3: Solve for $\alpha$**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $\alpha$:  
$$  
16 - 144 = 200\pi\alpha,  
$$  
$$  
-128 = 200\pi\alpha.  
$$  
Thus,  
$$  
\alpha = \frac{-128}{200\pi} = \frac{-16}{25\pi} \text{ rad/s}^2.  
$$  
*(Simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 8.)*  

**Step 4: Determine angular deceleration**  
Angular deceleration is the magnitude of $\alpha$:  
$$  
\text{Angular deceleration} = |\alpha| = \left| \frac{-16}{25\pi} \right| = \frac{16}{25\pi} \text{ rad/s}^2.  
$$  

**Conclusion**  
The flywheel decelerates at a constant rate of $\frac{16}{25\pi}$ rad/s².

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{16}{25\pi}}$$

# Bohr model energy levels and radii

## Problem 0
Background:
In the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, the electron orbits the proton in circular paths. The centripetal force is provided by the electrostatic attraction between the proton and electron. Bohr postulated that the angular momentum of the electron is quantized in units of the reduced Planck constant ℏ. The standard derivation yields the radius for quantum number n as $ r_n = n^2 a_0 $, where $ a_0 $ is the Bohr radius defined for our universe. The Bohr radius depends on fundamental constants: $ a_0 = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m_e e^2} $, where $ \epsilon_0 $ is the vacuum permittivity, $ m_e $ is the electron mass, and $ e $ is the elementary charge.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Force balance in circular motion (centripetal force equals Coulomb force).
2. Quantization of angular momentum ($ L = n\hbar $).
3. Algebraic derivation of the orbital radius.
4. Scaling of physical quantities with fundamental constants.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects quantum mechanics (Bohr's quantization) with classical mechanics (circular motion) and electrostatics (Coulomb's law). It demonstrates how atomic structure scales with quantum number n and fundamental constants.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The dependence of atomic radii on constants links to cosmology (variations in fundamental constants across universes) and spectroscopy (predicting spectral lines for modified atomic models).

Real-World Applications:
Understanding how constants affect atomic sizes helps test theories beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and explores hypothetical scenarios in multiverse cosmology.

Problem Statement:
Consider a parallel universe where the reduced Planck constant $ \hbar $ is doubled ($ \hbar' = 2\hbar $) compared to our universe, but all other fundamental constants (including $ \epsilon_0 $, $ m_e $, and $ e $) remain unchanged. Derive an expression for the radius of the $ n=3 $ orbit in hydrogen in this parallel universe. Express your final answer in terms of the Bohr radius $ a_0 $ from our universe.

## Solution
**Step 1: Derive the general formula for the orbital radius in the Bohr model**  
The forces on the electron must balance. Coulomb attraction provides the centripetal force:  
$$ \frac{k_e e^2}{r_n^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r_n}, $$  
where $ k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} $ is the Coulomb constant. Simplify:  
$$ \frac{k_e e^2}{r_n} = m_e v^2. \quad (1) $$  

The angular momentum is quantized:  
$$ L = m_e v r_n = n \hbar. \quad (2) $$  

Solve equation (2) for $ v $:  
$$ v = \frac{n \hbar}{m_e r_n}. \quad (3) $$  

Substitute equation (3) into equation (1):  
$$ \frac{k_e e^2}{r_n} = m_e \left( \frac{n \hbar}{m_e r_n} \right)^2 = \frac{n^2 \hbar^2}{m_e r_n^2}. $$  
Multiply both sides by $ r_n^2 $:  
$$ k_e e^2 r_n = \frac{n^2 \hbar^2}{m_e}. $$  
Solve for $ r_n $:  
$$ r_n = \frac{n^2 \hbar^2}{k_e m_e e^2}. \quad (4) $$  
Since $ k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} $, rewrite as:  
$$ r_n = \frac{n^2 \hbar^2 4\pi\epsilon_0}{m_e e^2}. \quad (5) $$  

**Step 2: Express the Bohr radius $ a_0 $ for our universe**  
For $ n=1 $ in our universe:  
$$ a_0 = \frac{\hbar^2 4\pi\epsilon_0}{m_e e^2}. \quad (6) $$  
Thus, equation (5) simplifies to $ r_n = n^2 a_0 $ in our universe.  

**Step 3: Modify the formula for the parallel universe**  
In the parallel universe, $ \hbar' = 2\hbar $, while $ \epsilon_0 $, $ m_e $, and $ e $ are unchanged. The radius formula (5) becomes:  
$$ r_n' = \frac{n^2 (\hbar')^2 4\pi\epsilon_0}{m_e e^2} = \frac{n^2 (2\hbar)^2 4\pi\epsilon_0}{m_e e^2} = \frac{4n^2 \hbar^2 4\pi\epsilon_0}{m_e e^2}. $$  
Using equation (6), substitute $ a_0 $:  
$$ r_n' = 4n^2 \left( \frac{\hbar^2 4\pi\epsilon_0}{m_e e^2} \right) = 4n^2 a_0. \quad (7) $$  

**Step 4: Calculate the radius for $ n=3 $**  
Substitute $ n=3 $ into equation (7):  
$$ r_3' = 4 \cdot (3)^2 \cdot a_0 = 4 \cdot 9 \cdot a_0 = 36 a_0. $$  
Thus, the radius of the $ n=3 $ orbit in the parallel universe is $ 36 $ times the Bohr radius $ a_0 $ of our universe.

## Answer
$$\boxed{36 a_0}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
The Bohr model, proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913, describes the hydrogen atom by combining classical mechanics with quantum postulates. In this model, an electron orbits the nucleus in circular paths with quantized angular momentum. This quantization leads to discrete energy levels, explaining hydrogen's emission spectrum. The energy derivation relies on balancing electrostatic attraction with centripetal force while incorporating Bohr's quantization rule.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Coulomb's law for electrostatic force
- Centripetal force in circular motion
- Quantization of angular momentum ($L = n \hbar$)
- Total energy as kinetic plus potential energy
- Algebraic manipulation of physical equations

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects mechanics (circular motion), electromagnetism (Coulomb's law), and quantum theory (angular momentum quantization). It demonstrates how classical concepts extend to quantum systems through postulates.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The Bohr model underpins atomic spectroscopy used in chemistry for elemental analysis and in astronomy for measuring stellar compositions. The n=2 energy level corresponds to visible light transitions in the Balmer series.

Real-World Applications:
Hydrogen energy levels enable technologies like atomic clocks and quantum sensors. Medical MRI scanners use similar quantization principles in nuclear magnetic resonance.

Problem Statement:
Consider the Bohr model of hydrogen where an electron (mass $m_e$, charge $-e$) orbits a proton (charge $+e$) in a circular path. The electrostatic force provides the centripetal force:

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r}
$$

where $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $r$ is the orbital radius, and $v$ is the electron's speed. Bohr postulated that angular momentum is quantized:  

$$
m_e v r = n \frac{h}{2\pi}
$$

where $h$ is Planck's constant and $n$ is the quantum number. The total energy $E$ is:  

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 - \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
$$


Using these equations:  
1. Derive the general expression for the energy $E_n$ of the electron in terms of $n$, $m_e$, $e$, $\epsilon_0$, and $h$.  
2. Hence, determine the energy for the $n=2$ state.  

Express your final answer for the $n=2$ energy in terms of $m_e$, $e$, $\epsilon_0$, and $h$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Solve for radius $r$**  
From angular momentum quantization:  

$$
m_e v r = n \frac{h}{2\pi} \implies v = \frac{n h}{2\pi m_e r} \quad (1)
$$
  
Substitute (1) into the force balance equation:  

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e}{r} \left( \frac{n h}{2\pi m_e r} \right)^2
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2} = \frac{m_e}{r} \cdot \frac{n^2 h^2}{4\pi^2 m_e^2 r^2} = \frac{n^2 h^2}{4\pi^2 m_e r^3}
$$
  
Multiply both sides by $r^3$:  

$$
\frac{e^2 r}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = \frac{n^2 h^2}{4\pi^2 m_e}
$$
  
Solve for $r$:  

$$
r = \frac{n^2 h^2 \epsilon_0}{\pi m_e e^2} \quad (2)
$$
  

**Step 2: Derive general energy $E_n$**  
Express kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $U$:  

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2, \quad U = -\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}
$$
  
From force balance:  

$$
\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2} \implies \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r} \quad (3)
$$
  
Substitute (3) into total energy:  

$$
E = \frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r} - \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r} = -\frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r} \quad (4)
$$
  
Substitute radius $r$ from (2) into (4):  

$$
E_n = -\frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_0} e^2 \cdot \frac{\pi m_e e^2}{n^2 h^2 \epsilon_0} = -\frac{m_e e^4}{8 \epsilon_0^2 h^2 n^2}
$$
  

**Step 3: Compute energy for $n=2$**  

$$
E_2 = -\frac{m_e e^4}{8 \epsilon_0^2 h^2 (2)^2} = -\frac{m_e e^4}{32 \epsilon_0^2 h^2}
$$

## Answer
$$
\boxed{-\dfrac{m_{e} e^{4}}{32 \epsilon_{0}^{2} h^{2}}}
$$

## Problem 2
Background:
The Bohr model describes the hydrogen atom and hydrogen-like ions (atoms with one electron) by quantizing angular momentum. In this model, the electron orbits the nucleus in discrete energy levels. The energy of an electron in orbit $n$ is given by:
$$ E_n = -\frac{k}{n^2} $$
where $k$ is a constant that depends on fundamental properties of the atom. For hydrogen-like atoms with nuclear charge $Ze$ (where $Z$ is the atomic number), the energy becomes:
$$ E_n = -\frac{k Z^2}{n^2} $$
The ionization energy $E_{\text{ion}}$ is the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state ($n=1$) to infinity, expressed as:
$$ E_{\text{ion}} = -E_1 = kZ^2 $$
When an electron transitions from a higher energy level $n_i$ to a lower level $n_f$, it emits a photon with energy:
$$ \Delta E = E_{n_i} - E_{n_f} = kZ^2 \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) $$
The wavelength $\lambda$ of the emitted photon relates to this energy by:
$$ \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$
where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Energy level transitions in the Bohr model
2. Relationship between ionization energy and atomic parameters
3. Photon energy-wavelength correspondence
4. Algebraic manipulation of quantum energy formulas

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects atomic energy quantization (quantum physics) with electromagnetic radiation (electromagnetism). It reinforces conservation of energy through photon emission during electron transitions.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The Bohr model underpins spectroscopy techniques used in chemistry for elemental analysis and in astronomy for determining stellar compositions through spectral lines.

Real-World Applications:
- Medical diagnostics: Identifying elements in tissue samples via emission spectra
- Astrophysics: Measuring elemental abundances in stars using spectral line analysis
- Material science: Characterizing quantum dots and nanomaterials through emitted light wavelengths

Problem Statement:
A hydrogen-like atom has ionization energy $E_{\text{ion}}$ from its ground state. When an electron transitions from the $n=4$ state to the $n=2$ state, a photon is emitted. Derive an expression for the wavelength $\lambda$ of this photon in terms of $E_{\text{ion}}$, Planck's constant $h$, and the speed of light $c$. Use only the symbols $E_{\text{ion}}$, $h$, and $c$ in your final expression.

Important Instructions:
- Express your answer as a single simplified fraction.
- Use $\dfrac{}{}$ for fractional expressions in LaTeX.
- Do not substitute numerical values or constants.

## Solution
**Step 1: Express energy difference for transition**  
The energy difference $\Delta E$ for an electron transitioning from $n_i = 4$ to $n_f = 2$ is:
$$ \Delta E = E_{\text{ion}} \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) $$
Substitute $n_f = 2$ and $n_i = 4$:
$$ \Delta E = E_{\text{ion}} \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{4^2} \right) = E_{\text{ion}} \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} \right) $$

**Step 2: Simplify the energy difference**  
Compute the expression in parentheses:
$$ \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{16} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{3}{16} $$
Thus:
$$ \Delta E = E_{\text{ion}} \cdot \frac{3}{16} = \frac{3E_{\text{ion}}}{16} $$

**Step 3: Relate energy to wavelength**  
The photon energy $\Delta E$ is given by:
$$ \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$
Equate the expressions:
$$ \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{3E_{\text{ion}}}{16} $$

**Step 4: Solve for wavelength**  
Rearrange to isolate $\lambda$:
$$ \lambda = \frac{hc}{\left( \frac{3E_{\text{ion}}}{16} \right)} = \frac{16hc}{3E_{\text{ion}}} $$
The expression for the wavelength is:
$$ \lambda = \frac{16hc}{3E_{\text{ion}}} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{16 h c}{3 E_{\text{ion}}}}$$

## Problem 3
**Background**:  
The Bohr model describes the hydrogen atom with an electron orbiting a proton in discrete circular orbits. Each orbit corresponds to a specific energy level labeled by the principal quantum number $n$. For hydrogen-like atoms (ions with one electron), the model extends by accounting for the nuclear charge $Ze$, where $Z$ is the atomic number. The radius of the electron's orbit depends on $n$ and $Z$, derived from balancing the Coulomb attraction with centripetal force under angular momentum quantization.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
- Derivation of the orbital radius formula for hydrogen-like atoms.  
- Dependence of radius on $n$ and $Z$.  
- Ratio calculations for atomic properties.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem connects to atomic physics (quantization) and classical mechanics (circular motion). It reinforces energy conservation and force balance in quantum systems.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
The Bohr model underpins spectroscopy (chemistry) and materials science (semiconductor band gaps). It also relates to astrophysics (stellar composition via spectral lines).  

**Real-World Applications**:  
Helium ions ($He^+$) are used in particle accelerators and plasma physics. Understanding orbital radii helps predict emission spectra for fusion research and medical imaging.  

**Problem**:  
Consider a helium ion ($He^+$) with nuclear charge $Z = 2$ and one electron. Derive the formula for the radius $r_n$ of the electron's orbit in the $n^{\text{th}}$ energy level using the Bohr model. Then, compute the ratio of the radius at $n=1$ to the radius at $n=3$. Express the ratio as a simplified fraction.  

**Required Format**:  
- Derive $r_n$ symbolically using $n$, $Z$, and fundamental constants (e.g., $\epsilon_0$, $\hbar$, $e$, $\mu$, where $\mu$ is the reduced mass).  
- The final ratio must be a simplified fraction.

## Solution
**Step 1: Force balance and quantization**  
The Coulomb force provides centripetal acceleration:  

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Ze^2}{r_n^2} = \frac{\mu v_n^2}{r_n},
$$
  
where $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the electron-nucleus system. Angular momentum is quantized:  

$$
\mu v_n r_n = n \hbar.
$$
  

**Step 2: Solve for velocity**  
From angular momentum quantization:  

$$
v_n = \frac{n \hbar}{\mu r_n}.
$$
  

**Step 3: Substitute into force balance**  

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Ze^2}{r_n^2} = \frac{\mu}{r_n} \left( \frac{n \hbar}{\mu r_n} \right)^2.
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Ze^2}{r_n^2} = \frac{n^2 \hbar^2}{\mu r_n^3}.
$$
  

**Step 4: Solve for $r_n$**  

$$
r_n^3 = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_0 n^2 \hbar^2 \mu r_n^3}{\mu Z e^2 r_n} \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_n = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_0 n^2 \hbar^2}{Z \mu e^2}.
$$
  
The orbital radius is:  

$$
r_n = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_0 \hbar^2 n^2}{Z \mu e^2}.
$$
  

**Step 5: Compute the ratio $r_1 / r_3$**  
For helium, $Z = 2$:  

$$
r_1 = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_0 \hbar^2 (1)^2}{(2) \mu e^2}, \quad r_3 = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_0 \hbar^2 (3)^2}{(2) \mu e^2}.
$$
  
The ratio is:  

$$
\frac{r_1}{r_3} = \frac{ \frac{4\pi\epsilon_0 \hbar^2}{2 \mu e^2} }{ \frac{4\pi\epsilon_0 \hbar^2 \cdot 9}{2 \mu e^2} } = \frac{1}{9}.
$$
  
Constants ($\epsilon_0$, $\hbar$, $e$, $\mu$) and $Z$ cancel.

## Answer
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{9}}
\]

## Problem 4
Background: The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913, combines classical mechanics with early quantum theory. It describes the electron orbiting the proton in circular paths with quantized angular momentum. This model successfully predicts hydrogen's spectral lines and ionization energies. The quantization condition states that the electron's angular momentum is an integer multiple of the reduced Planck constant: $L = n\hbar$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number. The electrostatic force provides the centripetal acceleration for the circular orbit.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Application of Newton's second law to circular motion under Coulomb's force.
2. Quantization of angular momentum in the Bohr model.
3. Derivation of the electron's total energy (kinetic + potential) as a function of quantum number $n$.
4. Definition of ionization energy as the energy required to transition from a bound state ($n=2$) to the unbound state ($n=\infty$).

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects classical mechanics (centripetal force, energy conservation) with quantum concepts (angular momentum quantization).
- Relates to atomic physics through the hydrogen spectrum and energy level transitions.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Chemistry: Ionization energy determines chemical reactivity and periodic table trends.
- Astronomy: Used to analyze spectral lines from stars and interstellar gas.

Real-World Applications:
- Mass spectrometry: Ionization energies help identify elements in unknown samples.
- Laser technology: Precise knowledge of energy levels enables tuned laser transitions (e.g., in medical lasers).

Problem Statement:
Using the Bohr model, derive the ionization energy required to remove an electron from the $n=2$ state of a hydrogen atom. Express your answer symbolically in terms of fundamental constants: electron mass $m_e$, elementary charge $e$, reduced Planck constant $\hbar$, and vacuum permittivity $\epsilon_0$.

Ensure your final expression is simplified and boxed. Do not substitute numerical values during derivation.

## Solution
**Step 1: Force balance equation**  
The electrostatic force provides centripetal acceleration:  
$$ \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e v^2}{r} \quad \text{(1)} $$  
where $r$ is the orbital radius and $v$ is the electron's speed.

**Step 2: Angular momentum quantization**  
Bohr's postulate for $n=2$:  
$$ m_e v r = 2\hbar \quad \text{(2)} $$  

**Step 3: Solve for $v^2$**  
Rearrange Equation (2):  
$$ v = \frac{2\hbar}{m_e r} $$  
Square both sides:  
$$ v^2 = \frac{4\hbar^2}{m_e^2 r^2} \quad \text{(3)} $$  

**Step 4: Substitute into force equation**  
Insert Equation (3) into Equation (1):  
$$ \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2} = \frac{m_e}{r} \left( \frac{4\hbar^2}{m_e^2 r^2} \right) $$  
Simplify:  
$$ \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2} = \frac{4\hbar^2}{m_e r^3} $$  
Multiply both sides by $r^3$:  
$$ \frac{e^2 r}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = \frac{4\hbar^2}{m_e} $$  
Solve for $r$:  
$$ r = \frac{16\pi\epsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m_e e^2} \quad \text{(4)} $$  

**Step 5: Total energy derivation**  
Total energy $E$ is kinetic + potential:  
$$ E = \frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 - \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r} $$  
From Equation (1), $\frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r}$:  
$$ E = \frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 r} - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} = -\frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 r} \quad \text{(5)} $$  

**Step 6: Substitute radius into energy**  
Insert Equation (4) into Equation (5):  
$$ E_2 = -\frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{m_e e^2}{16\pi\epsilon_0 \hbar^2} = -\frac{m_e e^4}{128 \pi^2 \epsilon_0^2 \hbar^2} $$  

**Step 7: Ionization energy**  
Ionization energy $\Delta E$ is the energy needed to go from $E_2$ to $E_\infty = 0$:  
$$ \Delta E = 0 - E_2 = \frac{m_e e^4}{128 \pi^2 \epsilon_0^2 \hbar^2} $$  
Simplify using $(4\pi\epsilon_0)^2 = 16\pi^2\epsilon_0^2$:  
$$ \Delta E = \frac{m_e e^4}{8 (4\pi\epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2} $$

## Answer
$$ \boxed{\dfrac{m_{e} e^{4}}{8 \left(4 \pi \epsilon_{0}\right)^{2} \hbar^{2}}} $$

## Problem 5
Background:
The Bohr model, developed by Niels Bohr in 1913, describes the behavior of electrons in hydrogen-like atoms (single-electron ions). This model combines classical mechanics with quantum principles, introducing quantized angular momentum. It successfully predicts energy levels and orbital radii for ions such as He⁺, Li²⁺, and Be³⁺. The model assumes circular orbits where the Coulomb force provides centripetal acceleration, while the electron's angular momentum is restricted to integer multiples of the reduced Planck constant ħ.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Application of Coulomb's law and centripetal force in circular motion
- Quantization of angular momentum in the Bohr model
- Derivation of orbital velocity from fundamental postulates
- Dependence of atomic properties on nuclear charge Z and quantum number n

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects to atomic spectra: Electron velocity determines kinetic energy, which contributes to total energy levels and spectral line emission.
- Relates to ionization energy: Ground-state velocity is essential for calculating binding energy in ions.
- Extends to quantum mechanics: This model introduces foundational concepts later refined in Schrödinger's wave equation.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Plasma physics: Electron velocities in highly ionized atoms affect conductivity and radiation in fusion plasmas.
- Astrophysics: Spectral lines from lithium ions (Li²⁺) appear in stellar atmospheres and supernova remnants.
- Medical physics: Ionized lithium is used in particle therapy for cancer treatment, where energy levels influence beam calibration.

Real-World Applications:
- Space telescopes (e.g., Hubble) analyze Li²⁺ spectra to determine lithium abundance in metal-poor stars, probing Big Bang nucleosynthesis.
- In tokamak reactors, Li²⁺ emission lines diagnose plasma temperature and impurity levels.
- Quantum computing research uses hydrogen-like ions for qubit implementations, requiring precise velocity calculations.

Problem:
In a laboratory plasma chamber, lithium ions (Li²⁺) are excited to high-energy states. As electrons transition to the ground state (n=1), they emit ultraviolet photons. To model this emission, derive the orbital velocity $v$ of an electron in the n=1 orbit of a Li²⁺ ion using the Bohr model. Start from these fundamental postulates:

1. Coulomb attraction provides centripetal force:  
   $$\frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Z e^2}{r^2}$$  
   where $Z = 3$ for lithium, $m_e$ is electron mass, $e$ is elementary charge, $\varepsilon_0$ is vacuum permittivity, and $r$ is orbital radius.

2. Angular momentum is quantized:  
   $$m_e v r = n \hbar$$  
   with $\hbar = h/(2\pi)$ (reduced Planck constant) and $n=1$.

Derive an expression for $v$ in terms of fundamental constants $e$, $\hbar$, and $\varepsilon_0$.  
**Express your final answer as a simplified symbolic expression.**

## Solution
**Step 1: Express radius from quantization condition**  
From the angular momentum quantization postulate:  
$$ m_e v r = n \hbar $$  
For ground state ($n=1$):  
$$ m_e v r = \hbar $$  
Solve for radius $r$:  
$$ r = \frac{\hbar}{m_e v} \quad (1) $$

**Step 2: Substitute radius into force equation**  
The Coulomb-centripetal force equation:  
$$ \frac{m_e v^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Z e^2}{r^2} $$  
Substitute $r$ from equation (1) and set $Z = 3$:  
$$ \frac{m_e v^2}{\left( \frac{\hbar}{m_e v} \right)} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{3 e^2}{\left( \frac{\hbar}{m_e v} \right)^2} $$

**Step 3: Simplify both sides**  
Left side:  
$$ m_e v^2 \cdot \frac{m_e v}{\hbar} = \frac{m_e^2 v^3}{\hbar} $$  
Right side:  
$$ \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot 3 e^2 \cdot \frac{(m_e v)^2}{\hbar^2} = \frac{3 e^2 m_e^2 v^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar^2} $$  
Equation becomes:  
$$ \frac{m_e^2 v^3}{\hbar} = \frac{3 e^2 m_e^2 v^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar^2} $$

**Step 4: Solve for velocity**  
Divide both sides by $m_e^2 v^2$ (valid since $v \neq 0$):  
$$ \frac{v}{\hbar} = \frac{3 e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar^2} $$  
Multiply both sides by $\hbar$:  
$$ v = \frac{3 e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar} $$

**Conclusion**  
The orbital velocity of an electron in the n=1 orbit of Li²⁺ is $\dfrac{3 e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar}$. This expression is independent of electron mass $m_e$, as it cancels during derivation.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{3e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\hbar}}$$

## Problem 6
Background:
The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom describes electrons orbiting the nucleus in quantized circular paths. A key insight by Niels Bohr was that angular momentum is quantized, which explained atomic stability and spectral lines. This model connects classical mechanics with early quantum theory through the de Broglie hypothesis, which treats electrons as matter waves. For an orbit to be stable, the circumference must accommodate an integer number of electron wavelengths, leading to discrete angular momentum states.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Quantization of angular momentum in the Bohr model
- de Broglie wavelength and its relation to momentum
- Standing wave condition for stable electron orbits
- Definition of angular momentum in circular motion

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem links foundational quantum concepts (quantization, wave-particle duality) with classical mechanics (angular momentum, circular motion). It also bridges atomic physics and wave theory by showing how matter waves constrain orbital motion.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The standing wave condition appears in acoustics (vibrations in circular membranes) and electrical engineering (resonant cavities). Quantized angular momentum principles are used in chemistry to explain atomic structure and in materials science for semiconductor behavior.

Real-World Applications:
The Bohr model underpins spectroscopy techniques used in astronomy (analyzing starlight), chemistry (identifying elements), and medical imaging (MRI). Understanding quantized angular momentum is essential for laser technology and quantum computing.

Problem:
Consider an electron in the n=5 state of a hydrogen atom. Using the de Broglie hypothesis ($\lambda = h / p$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $p$ is momentum) and the standing wave condition for a stable orbit, derive an expression for the electron's orbital angular momentum. Start from first principles, clearly justifying each step. Then, compute the angular momentum for n=5. Express your final answer as a multiple of the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$ (e.g., "kℏ" where k is a numerical coefficient).

Final Answer Format:
- Provide the angular momentum as a numerical coefficient multiplied by $\hbar$ (e.g., $5\hbar$).
- Use exact values only; no decimal approximations.

## Solution
**Step 1: Standing wave condition**  
For a stable orbit, the circumference must hold an integer number of de Broglie wavelengths:  
$$ 2\pi r = n \lambda $$  
where $r$ is the orbital radius, $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength, and $n$ is the quantum number (here, $n=5$).

**Step 2: de Broglie hypothesis**  
The electron's wavelength relates to its momentum $p$:  
$$ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} $$  
where $h$ is Planck's constant. Substitute this into Step 1:  
$$ 2\pi r = n \cdot \frac{h}{p} $$  

**Step 3: Solve for momentum**  
Rearrange to isolate $p$:  
$$ p = \frac{n h}{2\pi r} $$  

**Step 4: Angular momentum definition**  
For circular motion, angular momentum $L$ is:  
$$ L = r \times p $$  
Since $r$ and $p$ are perpendicular, $L = r p$. Substitute the expression for $p$ from Step 3:  
$$ L = r \cdot \left( \frac{n h}{2\pi r} \right) = \frac{n h}{2\pi} $$  

**Step 5: Introduce reduced Planck constant**  
Recognize that $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$. Thus:  
$$ L = n \hbar $$  

**Step 6: Compute for n=5**  
Substitute $n=5$:  
$$ L = 5 \hbar $$  

The angular momentum is $5$ times $\hbar$, consistent with Bohr's quantization rule.

## Answer
$$\boxed{5\hbar}$$

# catching and overtaking problems

## Problem 0
Background:
In highway safety analysis, overtaking maneuvers are critical to prevent accidents. Consider two vehicles: Car A and Car B, moving in the same direction on a straight road. Car A starts a distance $D$ behind Car B. Car A travels at constant speed $v_A$, while Car B travels at constant speed $v_B$, where $v_A > v_B$. Both cars have identical length $L$. The overtaking is defined as complete when Car A has fully passed Car B with an additional safe clearance distance equal to $L$ (i.e., the rear of Car A is ahead of the front of Car B by distance $L$). This accounts for vehicle dimensions and safety margins.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Relative motion in one dimension
- Kinematic equations for constant velocity
- Interpretation of positional constraints in overtaking scenarios

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem extends basic catching scenarios by incorporating vehicle dimensions and safety clearances, linking to collision avoidance systems and traffic flow dynamics in transportation physics.

The concepts apply to robotics (path planning for autonomous vehicles) and traffic engineering (designing safe passing zones on highways).

Real-World Applications:
Calculating minimum overtaking times is essential for designing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and optimizing highway lane configurations.

Problem:
Car A moves at $v_A = 20  \text{m/s}$ and starts $D = 150  \text{m}$ behind Car B, which moves at $v_B = 15  \text{m/s}$. Both cars are $L = 5  \text{m}$ long. Derive the time $t$ (in seconds) for Car A to complete the overtaking maneuver as defined above.  
Express your final answer as an integer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the coordinate system and initial positions**  
Set a coordinate system where the origin is at the starting position of the rear of Car B at $t = 0$:  
- Rear of Car B: $x_{Br}(t) = v_B t$  
- Front of Car B: $x_{Bf}(t) = v_B t + L$ (since length $L$ extends forward)  
- Front of Car A: $x_{Af}(t) = -D + v_A t$ (initially behind by distance $D$)  
- Rear of Car A: $x_{Ar}(t) = -D + v_A t - L$ (since length $L$ extends backward from front)  

**Step 2: Establish the overtaking condition**  
Overtaking is complete when the rear of Car A is ahead of the front of Car B by distance $L$:  

$$
x_{Ar}(t) = x_{Bf}(t) + L
$$
  
Substitute the expressions:  

$$
-D + v_A t - L = (v_B t + L) + L
$$


**Step 3: Solve for time $t$**  
Rearrange the equation:  

$$
-D + v_A t - L = v_B t + 2L
$$
  

$$
v_A t - v_B t = D + 3L
$$
  

$$
t(v_A - v_B) = D + 3L
$$
  

$$
t = \frac{D + 3L}{v_A - v_B}
$$


**Step 4: Substitute given values**  
$D = 150  \text{m}$, $L = 5  \text{m}$, $v_A = 20  \text{m/s}$, $v_B = 15  \text{m/s}$:  

$$
t = \frac{150 + 3(5)}{20 - 15} = \frac{150 + 15}{5} = \frac{165}{5} = 33
$$
  
The time is 33 seconds.

## Answer
$$\boxed{33}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
In a park, a cyclist starts from rest and accelerates uniformly to catch a jogger moving at a constant speed. The jogger has an initial distance advantage over the cyclist. This scenario models real-world situations like emergency response planning, athletic competitions, or autonomous vehicle coordination, where predicting overtaking times is essential for efficiency and safety.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Kinematic equations for motion with constant acceleration.  
2. Relative motion analysis.  
3. Solving quadratic equations derived from position-time relationships.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates core mechanics concepts: velocity-time relationships, acceleration effects on displacement, and the algebraic solution of systems describing two moving objects. It reinforces foundational calculus principles by linking derivatives (acceleration as the second derivative of position) to real motion.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Sports Science**: Optimizing pacing strategies in races.  
- **Transportation Engineering**: Calculating safe passing distances for vehicles.  
- **Robotics**: Path planning for autonomous drones or robots intercepting moving targets.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Determining the time for a faster vehicle to overtake a slower one on a highway.  
- Planning training regimens where athletes with different speeds and starting positions compete.  
- Designing algorithms for collision avoidance in dynamic systems.  

**Problem Statement**  
A cyclist starts from rest at point $O$ and accelerates at a constant acceleration $a$. At the initial moment, a jogger is moving with a constant speed $v_j$ and is a distance $d$ ahead of the cyclist (measured along a straight path). Derive an expression for the time $t$ (in seconds) when the cyclist catches the jogger. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $a$, $d$, and $v_j$.  

Provide the positive root that is physically meaningful. Box your final expression using simplified LaTeX notation.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define position functions**  
- Cyclist (constant acceleration $a$, initial velocity $0$):  
  
$$ s_c(t) = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 $$
  
- Jogger (constant velocity $v_j$, initial displacement $d$):  
  
$$ s_j(t) = d + v_j t $$
  

**Step 2: Set positions equal at catch time**  
The cyclist catches the jogger when $s_c(t) = s_j(t)$:  

$$ \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = d + v_j t $$
  

**Step 3: Rearrange into quadratic form**  
Move all terms to one side:  

$$ \frac{1}{2} a t^2 - v_j t - d = 0 $$
  
Multiply through by 2 to simplify:  

$$ a t^2 - 2 v_j t - 2d = 0 $$
  

**Step 4: Apply quadratic formula**  
The general solution for $A t^2 + B t + C = 0$ is $t = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$. Here:  
- $A = a$  
- $B = -2 v_j$  
- $C = -2d$  
Substitute:  

$$ t = \frac{ -(-2 v_j) \pm \sqrt{ (-2 v_j)^2 - 4(a)(-2d) } }{2a} = \frac{2 v_j \pm \sqrt{4 v_j^2 + 8 a d} }{2a} $$
  

**Step 5: Simplify the expression**  
Factor inside the square root:  

$$ t = \frac{2 v_j \pm \sqrt{4(v_j^2 + 2 a d)} }{2a} = \frac{2 v_j \pm 2 \sqrt{v_j^2 + 2 a d} }{2a} = \frac{ v_j \pm \sqrt{v_j^2 + 2 a d} }{a} $$
  

**Step 6: Select the physical root**  
Since $t > 0$ and $\sqrt{v_j^2 + 2 a d} > v_j$, the solution with the positive sign yields a positive time:  

$$ t = \frac{ v_j + \sqrt{v_j^2 + 2 a d} }{a} $$
  
The solution with the negative sign gives $t < 0$ (non-physical).

## Answer
$$\boxed{ \dfrac{ v_j + \sqrt{ v_j^{2} + 2  a  d } }{a} }$$

## Problem 2
Background:
In transportation systems, trains often share tracks and scheduling requires precise calculations for safe overtaking maneuvers. This problem examines a fundamental scenario where a faster train departs later than a slower train from the same station, traveling in the same direction. The solution involves modeling relative motion using uniform linear kinematics, where both trains maintain constant speeds. Understanding such scenarios is essential for railway operations and timetable design.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Application of uniform motion equations: $d = vt$
- Relative velocity concepts in one-dimensional motion
- Solving linear equations with time-shifted initial conditions
- Algebraic manipulation to derive a distance expression

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects to broader kinematics topics such as relative motion analysis, time-distance relationships, and intercept scenarios in physics. The algebraic approach reinforces equation-solving skills commonly applied in projectile motion and multi-stage journey problems.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The principles relate to optimization in operations research (scheduling efficiency), rate problems in mathematics (comparing linear functions), and pursuit algorithms in computer science (path prediction in autonomous systems).

Real-World Applications:
Train scheduling engineers use these calculations to design overtaking zones, minimize delays, and prevent conflicts on single-track railways. Similar models apply to air traffic control for sequencing aircraft, autonomous vehicle path planning, and logistics routing.

Problem:
A train departs a station at constant speed $v_1$. A second train leaves the same station $\Delta t$ time later at constant speed $v_2 > v_1$, moving in the same direction. Derive an expression for the distance $d$ from the station where the second train overtakes the first. Express $d$ exclusively in terms of $v_1$, $v_2$, and $\Delta t$.

Format requirements:
- Present final answer as a single simplified fraction
- Use only the variables $v_1$, $v_2$, and $\Delta t$
- Do not include units or numerical values

## Solution
**Step 1: Define time variables**  
Let $t$ be the time elapsed since the second train's departure when overtaking occurs. The first train has traveled for time $t + \Delta t$.

**Step 2: Express distances traveled**  
Distance covered by first train: $d = v_1 (t + \Delta t)$  
Distance covered by second train: $d = v_2 t$

**Step 3: Equate distances at overtaking point**  
Since both trains are at the same position when overtaking occurs:  

$$
v_1(t + \Delta t) = v_2 t
$$


**Step 4: Solve for $t$**  
Expand and rearrange terms:  

$$
v_1 t + v_1 \Delta t = v_2 t
$$
  

$$
v_1 \Delta t = v_2 t - v_1 t
$$
  

$$
v_1 \Delta t = t(v_2 - v_1)
$$
  

$$
t = \frac{v_1 \Delta t}{v_2 - v_1}
$$


**Step 5: Substitute $t$ into distance equation**  
Using the second train's distance equation:  

$$
d = v_2 \left( \frac{v_1 \Delta t}{v_2 - v_1} \right)
$$
  

$$
d = \frac{v_1 v_2 \Delta t}{v_2 - v_1}
$$


**Step 6: Verify expression**  
The denominator $v_2 - v_1 > 0$ since $v_2 > v_1$, ensuring positive distance. The expression satisfies dimensional consistency (speed × time = distance).

## Answer
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{v_{1} v_{2} \Delta t}{v_{2} - v_{1}}}
\]

## Problem 3
**Background**:  
In traffic enforcement, police vehicles must often accelerate to intercept speeding cars. This scenario models a pursuit where a police car, initially stationary, attempts to catch a speeder who has a head start. The problem involves kinematics with constant acceleration, requiring the derivation of a time expression based on relative motion principles.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. **Equations of motion** for constant acceleration (e.g., position as a function of time).  
2. **Condition for interception** (when the positions of two objects coincide).  
3. **Solving quadratic equations** arising from kinematic constraints.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem extends foundational kinematics to relative motion analysis, reinforcing concepts like displacement, velocity, and acceleration in one dimension. It also prepares students for advanced topics such as chase problems in particle dynamics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
The principles apply to robotics (path planning for autonomous vehicles) and sports science (modeling sprinter strategies in relay races).  

**Real-World Applications**:  
Calculating interception times is crucial in law enforcement (pursuit tactics), aerospace (rendezvous maneuvers), and wildlife biology (predator-prey interactions).  

**Problem Statement**:  
A police car starts from rest at position $x = 0$ and accelerates uniformly with acceleration $a$. At the initial moment ($t = 0$), a speeder is a distance $d$ ahead of the police car and moving at a constant velocity $v$ in the same direction. Derive an expression for the time $t$ at which the police car catches the speeder. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $a$, $d$, and $v$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define position functions**  
- The speeder moves with constant velocity $v$. Its position at time $t$ is:  
  $$x_s(t) = d + v t$$  
- The police car starts from rest ($u_p = 0$) and accelerates with constant acceleration $a$. Its position at time $t$ is:  
  $$x_p(t) = \frac{1}{2} a t^2$$  

**Step 2: Set up the interception condition**  
The police car catches the speeder when $x_p(t) = x_s(t)$:  
$$\frac{1}{2} a t^2 = d + v t$$  

**Step 3: Rearrange into a quadratic equation**  
Bring all terms to one side:  
$$\frac{1}{2} a t^2 - v t - d = 0$$  
Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:  
$$a t^2 - 2v t - 2d = 0$$  

**Step 4: Solve for $t$ using the quadratic formula**  
The quadratic equation $a t^2 - 2v t - 2d = 0$ has solutions:  
$$t = \frac{2v \pm \sqrt{(-2v)^2 - 4(a)(-2d)}}{2a}$$  
Simplify the discriminant:  
$$(-2v)^2 - 4(a)(-2d) = 4v^2 + 8a d$$  
Thus:  
$$t = \frac{2v \pm \sqrt{4v^2 + 8a d}}{2a} = \frac{2v \pm 2\sqrt{v^2 + 2a d}}{2a} = \frac{v \pm \sqrt{v^2 + 2a d}}{a}$$  

**Step 5: Select the physically meaningful root**  
Since $t > 0$ and $\sqrt{v^2 + 2a d} > v$, the solution with the negative sign ($t = \frac{v - \sqrt{v^2 + 2a d}}{a}$) is negative and non-physical. The valid solution is:  
$$t = \frac{v + \sqrt{v^2 + 2a d}}{a}$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{v + \sqrt{v^{2} + 2 a d}{a}}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**  
In urban transportation scenarios, understanding the motion dynamics between vehicles and pedestrians is crucial for safety and efficiency. This problem explores a situation where a runner attempts to catch up to a bus that is accelerating away. The runner starts behind the bus and maintains a constant speed, while the bus accelerates uniformly from an initial speed. The goal is to determine the minimum distance between the runner and the bus during their motion, which reveals whether the runner catches the bus (minimum distance ≤ 0) or falls behind (minimum distance > 0).  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Kinematics of motion with constant acceleration (bus) and constant velocity (runner).  
- Minimization of quadratic functions to find extreme values.  
- Relative motion analysis in one dimension.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates concepts from kinematics (position, velocity, acceleration) and algebra (quadratic functions, vertex analysis). It extends to interpreting the physical meaning of mathematical results, such as the sign of the discriminant in the context of overtaking.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The quadratic minimization approach connects to optimization in mathematics, while the motion analysis applies to physics. Real-world applications include traffic flow modeling and athletic training strategies.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Transportation Safety**: Calculating minimum safe distances between vehicles and pedestrians to prevent collisions.  
- **Robotics**: Path planning for autonomous robots chasing moving targets.  
- **Sports Science**: Optimizing sprint strategies to intercept accelerating objects.  

**Problem Statement**  
A runner starts 50 m behind a bus. The bus is initially moving at 5 m/s and accelerates at 1 m/s². The runner maintains a constant speed of 7 m/s. Derive a general symbolic expression for the minimum distance $d_{\text{min}}$ between the runner and the bus during their motion, in terms of the initial distance $D$, the bus's initial speed $u_b$, the bus's acceleration $a_b$, and the runner's speed $v_r$.  

Using the values $D = 50  \text{m}$, $u_b = 5  \text{m/s}$, $a_b = 1  \text{m/s}^2$, and $v_r = 7  \text{m/s}$, compute the numerical value of $d_{\text{min}}$ in meters.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Provide the numerical value of $d_{\text{min}}$ (in meters) as a non-negative real number. Omit units in your answer.

## Solution
### Step 1: Define Position Functions  
Set up a coordinate system where the bus starts at position $x = 0$ at time $t = 0$. The runner starts at $x = -D$ (since they are $D$ meters behind).  

- **Bus position** (accelerating motion):  
  
$$
  x_b(t) = u_b t + \frac{1}{2} a_b t^2
  $$
  

- **Runner position** (constant velocity):  
  
$$
  x_r(t) = v_r t - D
  $$
  

### Step 2: Define the Distance Function  
The distance between the bus and runner is $d(t) = x_b(t) - x_r(t)$:  

$$
d(t) = \left(u_b t + \frac{1}{2} a_b t^2\right) - (v_r t - D) = \frac{1}{2} a_b t^2 + (u_b - v_r)t + D
$$
  

### Step 3: Minimize the Quadratic Function  
The distance $d(t)$ is a quadratic in $t$:  

$$
d(t) = \frac{1}{2} a_b t^2 + (u_b - v_r)t + D
$$
  
Since $a_b > 0$, the parabola opens upward, and the minimum occurs at the vertex. The vertex time $t_{\text{min}}$ is:  

$$
t_{\text{min}} = -\frac{\text{coefficient of } t}{2 \times \text{coefficient of } t^2} = -\frac{u_b - v_r}{2 \times \frac{1}{2} a_b} = \frac{v_r - u_b}{a_b}
$$
  

### Step 4: Compute Minimum Distance  
Substitute $t_{\text{min}}$ into $d(t)$:  

$$
d_{\text{min}} = d(t_{\text{min}}) = \frac{1}{2} a_b \left(\frac{v_r - u_b}{a_b}\right)^2 + (u_b - v_r)\left(\frac{v_r - u_b}{a_b}\right) + D
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
d_{\text{min}} = \frac{1}{2} a_b \cdot \frac{(v_r - u_b)^2}{a_b^2} + (u_b - v_r) \cdot \frac{v_r - u_b}{a_b} + D = \frac{(v_r - u_b)^2}{2 a_b} - \frac{(v_r - u_b)^2}{a_b} + D
$$
  

$$
d_{\text{min}} = D - \frac{(v_r - u_b)^2}{2 a_b}
$$
  

### Step 5: Substitute Numerical Values  
Given $D = 50$, $u_b = 5$, $v_r = 7$, $a_b = 1$:  

$$
d_{\text{min}} = 50 - \frac{(7 - 5)^2}{2 \times 1} = 50 - \frac{2^2}{2} = 50 - \frac{4}{2} = 50 - 2 = 48
$$
  

The minimum distance is 48 meters. Since $d_{\text{min}} > 0$, the runner does not catch the bus.

## Answer
$$\boxed{48}$$

# center of mass motion and calculations

## Problem 0
Background:
In physics and engineering, the center of mass (COM) is the weighted average position of all mass in a system. For discrete point masses, it represents the balance point where the system behaves as if all mass were concentrated. This concept is essential in robotics, aerospace (e.g., drone stability), and biomechanics (e.g., analyzing human motion). Understanding COM calculations helps predict rotational behavior and stability of systems under external forces.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Definition and calculation of center of mass for discrete particles
- Weighted averages in two dimensions
- Coordinate geometry applications

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects to torque and rotational dynamics, as COM determines pivot behavior
- Relates to momentum conservation, where COM motion remains constant without external forces
- Extends to continuous mass distributions via integration (calculus)

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Engineering: Critical for structural design, vehicle stability, and robotics
- Computer Graphics: Used to animate realistic object motion
- Sports Science: Analyzes athlete balance and performance optimization

Real-World Applications:
- Drone design: COM must align with thrust vectors for stable flight
- Automotive safety: Low COM reduces rollover risk in vehicles
- Astronomy: Determines orbital paths of binary star systems

Problem Statement:
Three experimental nano-drones with masses of 2 kg, 3 kg, and 5 kg are being tested on a coordinate grid. The drones are positioned at (0,0), (4,0), and (0,3) respectively, where coordinates are in meters. Determine the exact coordinates of the system's center of mass relative to the origin. Express your answer as an ordered pair $(x_{cm}, y_{cm})$ where both coordinates are simplified fractions. Box only the numerical pair without units.

## Solution
The center of mass $(x_{cm}, y_{cm})$ for a system of $n$ point masses is given by:  
$$ x_{cm} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i}, \quad y_{cm} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i} $$  
where $m_i$ are masses and $(x_i, y_i)$ are their positions.

**Step 1: Calculate total mass**  
Total mass $M = m_1 + m_2 + m_3 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \, \text{kg}$.  

**Step 2: Compute $x_{cm}$**  
Numerator: $\sum m_i x_i = (2)(0) + (3)(4) + (5)(0) = 0 + 12 + 0 = 12$  
$$ x_{cm} = \frac{12}{10} = \frac{6}{5} $$  

**Step 3: Compute $y_{cm}$**  
Numerator: $\sum m_i y_i = (2)(0) + (3)(0) + (5)(3) = 0 + 0 + 15 = 15$  
$$ y_{cm} = \frac{15}{10} = \frac{3}{2} $$  

The center of mass coordinates are $\left( \frac{6}{5}, \frac{3}{2} \right)$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\left( \dfrac{6}{5},\ \dfrac{3}{2} \right)}$$

------
## Problem 1
**Background**

The center of mass is a point that represents the average location of an object's mass distribution. For continuous objects, it is calculated using integrals that account for how mass is distributed along the object. This problem explores a rod with a linear mass density that varies along its length—a common scenario in physics and engineering where materials are intentionally designed to have non-uniform properties for specific applications, such as in tapered sports equipment (e.g., baseball bats) or aerospace structures to optimize balance and stability.

**Knowledge Points Tested**
- Definition of center of mass for a continuous one-dimensional object.
- Integration techniques for calculating total mass and moment of mass.
- Handling linear mass density functions.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
- Connects to rotational dynamics, where the center of mass determines torque and rotational motion.
- Relates to moment of inertia calculations, which also involve integrating mass distributions with position-dependent functions.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
- In mechanical engineering, center of mass calculations are essential for designing stable structures and machinery.
- In biomechanics, understanding mass distribution helps model limb movements and balance in organisms.

**Real-World Applications**
- Designing cantilevered beams in construction to prevent tipping.
- Optimizing the "sweet spot" in sports equipment (e.g., golf clubs) by manipulating mass distribution.

**Problem Statement**

A thin rod of length $L$ has a linear mass density $\lambda = kx$, where $x$ is the distance from one end of the rod and $k$ is a positive constant. Determine the position of the center of mass of the rod relative to the end at $x=0$. 

Express your answer in terms of $L$.

## Solution
The center of mass $x_{\text{cm}}$ for a continuous object is defined as:
$$ x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{\int x \, dm}{\int dm} $$
where $dm$ is an infinitesimal mass element. Given the linear mass density $\lambda = kx$, the mass element is:
$$ dm = \lambda \, dx = kx \, dx $$
The rod extends from $x = 0$ to $x = L$. 

**Step 1: Calculate total mass $M$**  
Integrate $dm$ over the entire rod:
$$ M = \int_{0}^{L} dm = \int_{0}^{L} kx \, dx $$
Evaluate the integral:
$$ M = k \int_{0}^{L} x \, dx = k \left[ \frac{x^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{L} = k \left( \frac{L^2}{2} - 0 \right) = \frac{kL^2}{2} $$

**Step 2: Calculate the numerator $\int x \, dm$**  
This is the integral of position times mass element:
$$ \int x \, dm = \int_{0}^{L} x \cdot (kx) \, dx = k \int_{0}^{L} x^2 \, dx $$
Evaluate the integral:
$$ k \int_{0}^{L} x^2 \, dx = k \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{L} = k \left( \frac{L^3}{3} - 0 \right) = \frac{kL^3}{3} $$

**Step 3: Compute $x_{\text{cm}}$**  
Substitute the results from Steps 1 and 2 into the center of mass formula:
$$ x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{\frac{kL^3}{3}}{\frac{kL^2}{2}} = \frac{kL^3}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{kL^2} = \frac{2L^3}{3L^2} = \frac{2L}{3} $$
The constant $k$ cancels out, and the center of mass is at $\frac{2L}{3}$ from the end at $x=0$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{2L}{3}}$$

------
## Problem 2
Background: In physics, the center of mass (COM) of a system is a point that moves as if all mass were concentrated there and all external forces acted at that point. For an isolated system (no external forces), the COM velocity remains constant. This principle applies to scenarios like ice skaters pushing off on a frictionless surface, where internal forces (e.g., pushes between skaters) do not affect the COM motion.  

Knowledge Points Tested:  
- Definition of center of mass velocity: $ v_{\text{cm}} = \frac{m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2} $  
- Conservation of momentum: In an isolated system, total momentum remains constant.  
- Impulse-momentum theorem: Change in momentum equals impulse ($ \Delta p = F_{\text{avg}} \Delta t $).  

Intradisciplinary Connections:  
This problem integrates Newton's laws (internal forces via third law), momentum conservation, and COM kinematics. It reinforces how internal forces redistribute momentum within a system without altering COM motion.  

Interdisciplinary Connections:  
The COM concept appears in astronomy (binary star orbits), biomechanics (human movement analysis), and engineering (vehicle collision dynamics).  

Real-World Applications:  
- Figure skating pairs use COM principles to coordinate spins and jumps.  
- Spacecraft docking/undocking relies on COM velocity conservation in microgravity.  
- Automotive safety systems model passenger motion relative to the vehicle's COM during crashes.  

Problem:  
Two ice skaters, Alice (mass $ m_A = 60  \text{kg} $) and Bob (mass $ m_B = 80  \text{kg} $), are initially at rest on a frictionless ice rink. Alice exerts an average force of $ F = 400  \text{N} $ on Bob for $ \Delta t = 0.5  \text{s} $ during a push-off. Calculate the velocity of the center of mass of the system after the push.  
Express your answer in meters per second (m/s) and provide only the numerical value.

## Solution
**Step 1: Analyze forces and momentum conservation**  
The system is isolated horizontally (no external forces), so the total momentum before and after the push is conserved. Initially, both skaters are at rest:  

$$ p_{\text{initial}} = m_A v_{A,i} + m_B v_{B,i} = (60)(0) + (80)(0) = 0  \text{kg·m/s} $$
  
By conservation of momentum:  

$$ p_{\text{final}} = p_{\text{initial}} = 0  \text{kg·m/s} $$
  

**Step 2: Apply Newton's third law**  
Alice exerts $ F = 400  \text{N} $ on Bob (eastward). By Newton's third law, Bob exerts an equal-magnitude opposite force on Alice:  

$$ F_{\text{B on A}} = -400  \text{N} \ \text{(westward)} $$
  

**Step 3: Calculate final velocities using impulse**  
Impulse on Bob: $ J_B = F \Delta t = (400)(0.5) = 200  \text{N·s} $ eastward.  
By impulse-momentum theorem (initial velocity = 0):  

$$ m_B v_{B,f} = J_B \implies v_{B,f} = \frac{J_B}{m_B} = \frac{200}{80} = 2.5  \text{m/s}  \ \text{(east)} $$
  

Impulse on Alice: $ J_A = F_{\text{B on A}} \Delta t = (-400)(0.5) = -200  \text{N·s} $ (eastward = positive).  

$$ m_A v_{A,f} = J_A \implies v_{A,f} = \frac{J_A}{m_A} = \frac{-200}{60} = -\frac{10}{3}  \text{m/s} \approx -3.333  \text{m/s}  \ \text{(west)} $$
  

**Step 4: Compute center of mass velocity**  

$$ v_{\text{cm}} = \frac{m_A v_{A,f} + m_B v_{B,f}}{m_A + m_B} = \frac{(60)\left(-\frac{10}{3}\right) + (80)(2.5)}{60 + 80} $$
  
Numerator:  

$$ (60)\left(-\frac{10}{3}\right) = -200, \quad (80)(2.5) = 200 \implies -200 + 200 = 0 $$
  
Denominator:  

$$ m_A + m_B = 140  \text{kg} $$
  

$$ v_{\text{cm}} = \frac{0}{140} = 0  \text{m/s} $$
  

**Conclusion**  
The center of mass velocity remains $ 0  \text{m/s} $ because the system is isolated, and initial momentum is zero. Internal forces do not affect COM motion.

# centripetal acceleration and force calculations

## Problem 0
**Background: Circular Motion and Friction**

When an object moves in a circular path at constant speed, it experiences centripetal acceleration directed toward the center of the circle. This acceleration requires a net centripetal force. For a car on a flat circular track, static friction between the tires and the road provides this force. The maximum static friction force is $ f_s^{\text{max}} = \mu_s N $, where $ \mu_s $ is the coefficient of static friction and $ N $ is the normal force. If the required centripetal force exceeds this maximum, the car will skid. The minimum $ \mu_s $ to prevent skidding depends on the car's speed, the track's radius, and gravitational acceleration.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**
1. Centripetal acceleration: $ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $
2. Newton's second law for circular motion: $ F_{\text{net}} = m a_c $
3. Static friction limit: $ f_s \leq \mu_s N $
4. Force balance in the vertical direction

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**
This problem integrates kinematics (circular motion) with dynamics (Newton's laws and friction). It demonstrates how centripetal force requirements constrain physical parameters like friction coefficients, linking motion descriptions to force interactions.

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**
- **Civil Engineering:** Road designers use this principle to determine safe speed limits for unbanked curves.
- **Automotive Safety:** Tire manufacturers optimize tread materials to maximize $ \mu_s $, preventing skidding during turns.

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Race Tracks:** Drivers must know the friction limits of their tires to avoid skidding on flat curves.
- **Everyday Driving:** Reducing speed on wet roads (lower $ \mu_s $) prevents loss of control when turning.

**Problem Statement:**

A car of mass $ m $ travels at constant speed $ v $ around a flat (unbanked) circular track of radius $ r $. The acceleration due to gravity is $ g $. Derive the expression for the minimum coefficient of static friction $ \mu_s $ between the tires and track required to prevent skidding.

**Required Format for the Final Answer:**
Express $ \mu_s $ symbolically in terms of $ v $, $ r $, and $ g $ only. Use the notation $ \mu_s = \text{[expression]} $. The final answer must be enclosed in a box as a single fraction.

## Solution
**Step 1: Centripetal Force Requirement**  
The car undergoes uniform circular motion, so the net force toward the center is the centripetal force:  
$$ F_c = m a_c = m \frac{v^2}{r} $$  
This force must be provided entirely by static friction since the track is flat and unbanked.

**Step 2: Maximum Friction Force**  
The maximum static friction force is:  
$$ f_s^{\text{max}} = \mu_s N $$  
For no vertical acceleration, the normal force equals the car's weight:  
$$ N = mg $$  
Thus:  
$$ f_s^{\text{max}} = \mu_s m g $$  

**Step 3: Equilibrium Condition for No Skidding**  
To prevent skidding, the centripetal force must not exceed the maximum friction force:  
$$ F_c \leq f_s^{\text{max}} $$  
At the minimum $ \mu_s $, equality holds:  
$$ m \frac{v^2}{r} = \mu_s m g $$  

**Step 4: Solve for $ \mu_s $**  
Divide both sides by $ m $ (mass cancels out):  
$$ \frac{v^2}{r} = \mu_s g $$  
Isolate $ \mu_s $:  
$$ \mu_s = \frac{v^2}{g r} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The minimum coefficient of static friction is $ \frac{v^2}{g r} $. Mass $ m $ does not affect the result, as it cancels out in the derivation.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{v^{2}}{g r}}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
When an object moves in a vertical circle, it experiences varying forces due to gravity and centripetal acceleration. This scenario is common in amusement park rides, athletic hammer throws, and engineering systems like centrifuges. For a bucket of water swung vertically, water spills if the centripetal force at the top of the circle is insufficient to counteract gravity. The minimum speed occurs when the normal force from the bucket on the water drops to zero, meaning gravity alone provides the centripetal force.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Centripetal acceleration and force in circular motion.  
- Newton's second law applied to radial dynamics.  
- Equilibrium conditions for contact forces in vertical motion.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This connects to energy conservation (alternate method for vertical circles), Newtonian mechanics (force analysis), and rotational kinematics (angular velocity relationships).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- Engineering: Design of roller coaster loops ensuring safe speeds.  
- Sports Science: Optimizing hammer throw techniques to maximize speed.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Amusement rides: Calculating minimum speeds to keep riders safely in loop-the-loop tracks.  
- Fluid dynamics: Preventing spillage in rotating industrial tanks.  

**Problem Statement**  
A bucket of water of mass $m$ is swung in a vertical circle of radius $r$ at a constant speed $v$. Derive the minimum speed $v_{\text{min}}$ at the highest point of the circle that prevents the water from spilling. Assume gravitational acceleration is $g$, and ignore air resistance.  

**Final Answer Format**  
- Express $v_{\text{min}}$ symbolically in terms of $g$ and $r$.  
- Use $\sqrt{\ }$ for square roots (e.g., $\sqrt{gr}$).  
- Do not include units or any other text in the boxed answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify forces at the top of the circle**  
At the highest point, two forces act on the water:  
- Gravitational force: $mg$ downward (toward Earth).  
- Normal force ($N$) from the bucket: downward (toward the center of the circle).  

The net downward force provides the centripetal force required for circular motion.  

**Step 2: Apply Newton's second law radially**  
Centripetal acceleration is $\frac{v^2}{r}$ toward the center (downward at the top). Newton's second law gives:  
$$ N + mg = m \frac{v^2}{r} $$  

**Step 3: Define the spill condition**  
Water spills when it loses contact with the bucket, which occurs when $N = 0$. Substitute this into the equation:  
$$ 0 + mg = m \frac{v_{\text{min}}^2}{r} $$  

**Step 4: Solve for $v_{\text{min}}$**  
Simplify by dividing both sides by $m$:  
$$ g = \frac{v_{\text{min}}^2}{r} $$  
Multiply both sides by $r$:  
$$ gr = v_{\text{min}}^2 $$  
Take the square root:  
$$ v_{\text{min}} = \sqrt{gr} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The minimum speed at the top to prevent spilling is $\sqrt{gr}$. Below this speed, gravity exceeds the required centripetal force, causing the water to fall.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{gr}}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
In circular motion, an object moving along a circular path experiences centripetal acceleration directed toward the center of the circle. This acceleration arises from a net centripetal force and is essential for maintaining circular motion. For an object moving with constant angular speed, the centripetal acceleration can be expressed in terms of angular speed and radius. The angular speed relates to the number of revolutions completed in a given time interval, connecting rotational kinematics to linear acceleration.  

Knowledge Points Tested:  
- Relationship between angular speed and centripetal acceleration  
- Conversion between angular displacement and revolutions  
- Application of kinematic equations in rotational motion  

Intradisciplinary Connections:  
This problem integrates concepts from rotational kinematics (angular displacement, angular speed) and dynamics (centripetal acceleration). It reinforces the vector nature of acceleration in two-dimensional motion and extends the understanding of uniform circular motion beyond linear velocity.  

Interdisciplinary Connections:  
The principles apply to engineering designs involving rotational systems (e.g., centrifuges in biomedical labs, amusement park rides) and astronomy (orbital motion of celestial bodies).  

Real-World Applications:  
Centripetal acceleration calculations are crucial in designing safe curves for highways, analyzing the motion of satellites, and developing sports equipment like hammer throws in track and field.  

Problem:  
A stone attached to a string of length $L$ is whirled in a horizontal circle with constant angular speed. The stone completes $N$ revolutions in time $T$. Derive an expression for the centripetal acceleration $a_c$ of the stone in terms of $L$, $N$, and $T$. Use mathematical constants where necessary.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define angular speed**  
The stone completes $N$ revolutions in time $T$. Since one revolution corresponds to an angular displacement of $2\pi$ radians, the total angular displacement $\theta$ is:  
$$ \theta = 2\pi N $$  
The angular speed $\omega$ (rate of change of angular displacement) is:  
$$ \omega = \frac{\theta}{T} = \frac{2\pi N}{T} $$  

**Step 2: Relate centripetal acceleration to angular speed**  
For an object in uniform circular motion with radius $r$ and angular speed $\omega$, the centripetal acceleration $a_c$ is given by:  
$$ a_c = r \omega^2 $$  
Here, the radius of the circular path equals the string length $L$, so:  
$$ r = L $$  
Substituting $r = L$:  
$$ a_c = L \omega^2 $$  

**Step 3: Substitute the expression for $\omega$**  
Replace $\omega$ with $\frac{2\pi N}{T}$:  
$$ a_c = L \left( \frac{2\pi N}{T} \right)^2 $$  

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
Expand the square:  
$$ a_c = L \cdot \frac{(2\pi N)^2}{T^2} = L \cdot \frac{4\pi^2 N^2}{T^2} $$  
This simplifies to:  
$$ a_c = \frac{4\pi^2 N^2 L}{T^2} $$

## Answer
$$ \boxed{\frac{4\pi^{2}N^{2}L}{T^{2}}} $$

------
## Problem 3
**Background**  
Banked curves are commonly used in highways and racetracks to allow vehicles to safely navigate turns at high speeds. The banking angle is designed such that at a specific "design speed," the centripetal force is provided entirely by the horizontal component of the normal force, eliminating the need for friction. However, when a vehicle travels at a speed different from the design speed, friction becomes necessary to prevent sliding. This problem explores the friction force required for a car navigating a banked curve at a given speed.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Centripetal acceleration and force in uniform circular motion.  
- Newton's second law in two dimensions.  
- Vector resolution of forces on an inclined plane.  
- Static friction and its role in circular motion.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates concepts from kinematics (circular motion) and dynamics (Newton's laws). It requires understanding how forces decompose into radial and vertical components to provide centripetal acceleration while maintaining vertical equilibrium.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The principles apply to mechanical engineering (road and vehicle design) and sports science (velodrome cycling). Similar force-balance concepts appear in aeronautics during banked turns of aircraft and in planetary science for orbital dynamics.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Banked curves reduce reliance on friction, enhancing safety in wet or icy conditions. Engineers use these calculations to design curves with appropriate banking angles and speed limits. Examples include highway interchanges, NASCAR tracks, and roller coasters.  

**Problem Statement**  
A car of mass $m = 1000  \text{kg}$ travels at speed $v = 20  \text{m/s}$ around a banked curve of radius $r = 50  \text{m}$. The banking angle is $\theta = 30^\circ$. Assume the gravitational acceleration is $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$.  

Derive a symbolic expression for the magnitude of the friction force $f$ required to keep the car from sliding, in terms of $m$, $g$, $\theta$, $r$, and $v$. Then, compute the numerical value of $f$ using the given parameters.  

Express your final numerical answer in **newtons (N)**, rounded to the nearest whole number. Provide only the numerical value in the boxed answer.

## Solution
To find the friction force $f$, we apply Newton's second law in two dimensions. The forces acting on the car are:  
- Gravity: $mg$ downward.  
- Normal force: $N$ perpendicular to the banked surface.  
- Friction: $f$ parallel to the banked surface. Since the car travels faster than the design speed, friction acts down the incline to provide additional centripetal force.  

Define a coordinate system:  
- $x$-axis: Horizontal, toward the center of the curve (radial direction).  
- $y$-axis: Vertical, upward.  

Resolve forces into $x$ and $y$ components:  
1. **Normal force ($N$):**  
   - $x$-component: $N \sin \theta$ (toward center).  
   - $y$-component: $N \cos \theta$ (upward).  
2. **Friction force ($f$):**  
   - $x$-component: $f \cos \theta$ (toward center, since friction acts down the incline).  
   - $y$-component: $-f \sin \theta$ (downward).  
3. **Gravity ($mg$):**  
   - $x$-component: $0$.  
   - $y$-component: $-mg$.  

**Equations of motion:**  
- **Radial ($x$) direction** (centripetal force):  
  $$ N \sin \theta + f \cos \theta = \frac{m v^2}{r} \quad (1) $$  
- **Vertical ($y$) direction** (equilibrium):  
  $$ N \cos \theta - f \sin \theta = mg \quad (2) $$  

Solve for $f$:  
1. Multiply equation (1) by $\cos \theta$ and equation (2) by $\sin \theta$:  
   $$ (N \sin \theta + f \cos \theta) \cos \theta = \frac{m v^2}{r} \cos \theta \quad \Rightarrow \quad N \sin \theta \cos \theta + f \cos^2 \theta = \frac{m v^2 \cos \theta}{r} \quad (1a) $$  
   $$ (N \cos \theta - f \sin \theta) \sin \theta = mg \sin \theta \quad \Rightarrow \quad N \cos \theta \sin \theta - f \sin^2 \theta = mg \sin \theta \quad (2a) $$  

2. Subtract equation (2a) from (1a):  
   $$ (N \sin \theta \cos \theta + f \cos^2 \theta) - (N \cos \theta \sin \theta - f \sin^2 \theta) = \frac{m v^2 \cos \theta}{r} - mg \sin \theta $$  
   Simplify:  
   $$ f (\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta) = m \left( \frac{v^2 \cos \theta}{r} - g \sin \theta \right) $$  
   Since $\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1$:  
   $$ f = m \left( \frac{v^2 \cos \theta}{r} - g \sin \theta \right) \quad (3) $$  

This expression gives $f$ when friction acts down the incline. For $v > \sqrt{r g \tan \theta}$ (the design speed), $f > 0$.  

**Numerical calculation:**  
Substitute $m = 1000  \text{kg}$, $v = 20  \text{m/s}$, $r = 50  \text{m}$, $\theta = 30^\circ$, $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$:  
- $\cos 30^\circ = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660$, $\sin 30^\circ = 1/2 = 0.5$.  
- Compute term inside parentheses:  
  $$ \frac{v^2 \cos \theta}{r} = \frac{(20)^2 \cdot 0.8660}{50} = \frac{400 \cdot 0.8660}{50} = \frac{346.4}{50} = 6.928  \text{m/s}^2 $$  
  $$ g \sin \theta = 9.8 \cdot 0.5 = 4.9  \text{m/s}^2 $$  
  $$ \frac{v^2 \cos \theta}{r} - g \sin \theta = 6.928 - 4.9 = 2.028  \text{m/s}^2 $$  
- Friction force:  
  $$ f = 1000 \cdot 2.028 = 2028  \text{N} $$  

Rounded to the nearest whole number: $2028  \text{N}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{2028}$$

## Problem 4
**Background:**  
Roller coasters use loops to create thrilling experiences by exploiting circular motion physics. At the top of a vertical loop, the interplay between gravitational force and the normal force from the track dictates whether riders feel weightlessness, pressure, or even risk detachment. Understanding these forces requires modeling centripetal acceleration and applying Newton's laws in a radial coordinate system.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Newton's second law for circular motion.  
2. Centripetal acceleration and its dependence on speed and radius.  
3. Vector decomposition of forces in radial coordinates.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem connects to kinematics (circular motion equations) and energy conservation (speed derivation at different loop points). It also reinforces vector addition and coordinate systems in dynamics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Mechanical engineering uses these principles for structural safety in ride design. Biomechanics applies similar force analysis to understand physiological impacts on riders.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Engineers calculate normal forces to ensure roller coasters remain on tracks (N > 0) and exert safe forces on passengers. Similar physics governs aircraft loop maneuvers, planetary orbit stability, and centrifuges.  

**Problem:**  
A roller coaster car of mass $m$ passes the top of a vertical circular loop of radius $r$ at speed $v$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$. Derive an expression for the normal force $N$ exerted by the track on the car at this point.  

**Requirements:**  
- Start from Newton's second law and centripetal acceleration.  
- Express $N$ symbolically in terms of $m$, $v$, $r$, and $g$.  
- Box your final answer as a single expression.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify forces and coordinate system**  
At the top of the loop, two forces act on the car:  
- Gravitational force: $mg$ downward (toward Earth's center).  
- Normal force: $N$ downward (track pushes car toward loop center).  
Both forces are radial and directed toward the center of the circular path.  

**Step 2: Apply Newton's second law radially**  
The net radial force provides centripetal acceleration:  
$$ \sum F_{\text{radial}} = m a_c $$  
where $a_c$ is centripetal acceleration.  

**Step 3: Express centripetal acceleration**  
For circular motion at speed $v$ and radius $r$:  
$$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $$  
The direction is radially inward (downward at the top).  

**Step 4: Write net radial force**  
Summing downward forces:  
$$ \sum F_{\text{radial}} = mg + N $$  
This net force equals the centripetal force:  
$$ mg + N = m a_c $$  

**Step 5: Substitute $a_c$ and solve for $N$**  
$$ mg + N = m \left( \frac{v^2}{r} \right) $$  
Isolate $N$:  
$$ N = m \frac{v^2}{r} - mg $$  
Factor out $m$:  
$$ N = m \left( \frac{v^2}{r} - g \right) $$  
This is the symbolic expression for the normal force.

## Answer
$$ \boxed{m\left(\frac{v^{2}}{r} - g\right)} $$

# circular motion period and frequency

## Problem 0
Background:
Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration experienced by an object moving in a circular path, directed toward the center of the circle. This acceleration occurs because the velocity vector constantly changes direction, even when speed is constant. The magnitude of centripetal acceleration depends on the object's tangential speed and the radius of the circular path. Understanding this concept is crucial for analyzing motion in curves, from vehicles on roads to planets in orbits.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Definition of centripetal acceleration
- Relationship between tangential velocity, radius, and centripetal acceleration
- Vector decomposition of acceleration in circular motion

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This concept connects to Newton's second law ($F = ma$), as centripetal acceleration requires a centripetal force. It also relates to rotational kinematics, where angular velocity $\omega$ is linked to tangential velocity $v$ through $v = \omega r$.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
In mechanical engineering, centripetal acceleration principles are used to design safe highway curves and roller coasters. In astronomy, these principles explain planetary orbits and satellite motion. In sports science, they analyze the dynamics of athletes navigating curved paths.

Real-World Applications:
1. **Transportation Safety**: Engineers calculate centripetal acceleration to determine maximum safe speeds for vehicles on curved roads.
2. **Amusement Rides**: Roller coaster loops are designed using centripetal acceleration to ensure sufficient force for circular motion without exceeding safety limits.
3. **Planetary Science**: Centripetal acceleration governs orbital mechanics, such as Earth's motion around the Sun.

Task:
A car moves uniformly along a circular curve of radius $R$. At a specific instant, its tangential speed is $v$. Starting from the fundamental definition of acceleration ($\vec{a} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}$), derive an expression for the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration $a_c$ in terms of $v$ and $R$. Then, compute the numerical value of $a_c$ for $v = 25  \text{m/s}$ and $R = 80  \text{m}$. 

Final Answer Format:
Express the numerical value of $a_c$ in $\text{m/s}^2$, rounded to two decimal places. Provide only the numerical value in the box, without units.

## Solution
### Step 1: Analyze velocity vectors
Consider two points on the circular path: Point A and Point B, separated by a small angle $\Delta \theta$. At both points, the speed is $v$, but the velocity vectors $\vec{v_A}$ and $\vec{v_B}$ are tangential to the circle and thus perpendicular to their respective radii. The angle between $\vec{v_A}$ and $\vec{v_B}$ is $\Delta \theta$ because the tangent is always perpendicular to the radius.

### Step 2: Calculate change in velocity
The change in velocity $\Delta \vec{v} = \vec{v_B} - \vec{v_A}$. For small $\Delta \theta$, the magnitude of $\Delta \vec{v}$ is approximately the arc length between the tips of $\vec{v_A}$ and $\vec{v_B}$ on the velocity diagram:

$$
|\Delta \vec{v}| \approx v \cdot \Delta \theta
$$

This approximation becomes exact as $\Delta \theta \to 0$.

### Step 3: Relate angle to time
The arc length traveled by the car between A and B is $v \Delta t$, where $\Delta t$ is the time interval. This arc length also equals $R \Delta \theta$ (by definition of the radian). Thus:

$$
R \Delta \theta = v \Delta t \implies \Delta \theta = \frac{v \Delta t}{R}
$$


### Step 4: Substitute into velocity change
Substitute $\Delta \theta$ from Step 3 into the expression for $|\Delta \vec{v}|$:

$$
|\Delta \vec{v}| = v \cdot \left( \frac{v \Delta t}{R} \right) = \frac{v^2 \Delta t}{R}
$$


### Step 5: Apply acceleration definition
Centripetal acceleration is the magnitude of the instantaneous acceleration:

$$
a_c = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{|\Delta \vec{v}|}{\Delta t} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\frac{v^2 \Delta t}{R}}{\Delta t} = \frac{v^2}{R}
$$


### Step 6: Compute numerical value
Given $v = 25  \text{m/s}$ and $R = 80  \text{m}$:

$$
a_c = \frac{(25)^2}{80} = \frac{625}{80} = 7.8125  \text{m/s}^2
$$

Rounded to two decimal places:  

$$
7.8125 \approx 7.81
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{7.81}$$

## Solution
**Step 1: Recall the angular velocity formula**  
For uniform circular motion, angular velocity $\omega$ is related to the period $T$ by:  
$$ \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} $$  
where $T$ is the orbital period.

**Step 2: Convert period to seconds**  
Given $T = 90 \text{ minutes}$:  
$$ T = 90 \times 60 = 5400 \text{ seconds} $$  
since 1 minute = 60 seconds.

**Step 3: Substitute into the formula**  
$$ \omega = \frac{2\pi}{5400} = \frac{\pi}{2700} \text{ rad/s} $$  

**Step 4: Compute numerical value**  
Using $\pi \approx 3.1415926535$:  
$$ \omega = \frac{3.1415926535}{2700} \approx 0.001163552464259 \text{ rad/s} $$  

**Step 5: Round to four significant digits**  
- Scientific notation: $1.163552464259 \times 10^{-3}$  
- Fourth significant digit is the fourth non-zero digit (3). The next digit (5) is ≥5, so round up:  
  $1.164 \times 10^{-3}$  
- Decimal form: $0.001164$  

**Conclusion**  
The angular velocity is approximately $0.001164$ rad/s.

## Problem 2
### Background
Frequency is a fundamental concept in circular motion, representing the number of complete cycles per unit time. For rotating objects like Ferris wheels, frequency determines how rapidly they complete revolutions and is inversely related to the period (time for one full cycle). This problem explores how observable rotational data can be used to derive frequency through unit conversion and fundamental definitions. 

#### Knowledge Points Tested
- Definition of frequency ($f$) as cycles per unit time: $f = \frac{\text{number of cycles}}{\text{time}}$.
- Relationship between frequency and period ($T$): $f = \frac{1}{T}$.
- Unit conversions (minutes to seconds) and dimensional analysis.

#### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to angular velocity ($\omega = 2\pi f$) in rotational dynamics.
- Forms the basis for centripetal acceleration ($a_c = \omega^2 r$) and centripetal force ($F_c = m\omega^2 r$).

#### Interdisciplinary Connections
- In engineering, frequency calculations are essential for designing rotating machinery (e.g., turbines, motors).
- In biology, frequency measurements apply to periodic phenomena like heartbeats or circadian rhythms.

#### Real-World Applications
- Ride safety: Engineers use frequency to ensure amusement rides operate within safe rotational limits.
- Astronomy: Orbital frequencies determine planetary and satellite motion periods.
- Medical devices: Centrifuges in laboratories rely on precise frequency control for blood sample separation.

### Problem Statement
A Ferris wheel at an amusement park completes exactly **5 revolutions** in a time interval of **2 minutes**. Assuming uniform rotational motion, derive the frequency of rotation in **hertz (Hz)**, where 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second.  

Express the numerical value of the frequency as an exact fraction. Do not include the unit (Hz) in your final answer.

## Solution
### Solution

#### Step 1: Identify given quantities
- Number of complete cycles (revolutions): $N = 5$  
- Time elapsed: $t = 2 \text{ minutes}$  

#### Step 2: Convert time to seconds  
Since frequency requires time in seconds (as hertz is defined per second), convert minutes to seconds:  

$$
t = 2  \text{minutes} \times \frac{60  \text{seconds}}{1  \text{minute}} = 120  \text{seconds}
$$


#### Step 3: Apply the definition of frequency  
Frequency $f$ is the number of cycles per unit time:  

$$
f = \frac{N}{t}
$$
  
Substitute $N = 5$ and $t = 120  \text{s}$:  

$$
f = \frac{5}{120}  \text{Hz}
$$


#### Step 4: Simplify the fraction  
Reduce $\frac{5}{120}$ to its simplest form:  

$$
\frac{5}{120} = \frac{5 \div 5}{120 \div 5} = \frac{1}{24}  \text{Hz}
$$
  
The exact frequency is $\frac{1}{24}$ Hz.  

#### Final numerical value  
The numerical value of the frequency, expressed as an exact fraction, is $\frac{1}{24}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{24}}$$

## Problem 3
**Background**  
In a physics experiment, a conical pendulum is set up to study circular motion. A mass is attached to a string and whirled in a horizontal circle at a constant frequency. This system demonstrates the relationship between tension, centripetal force, and gravitational forces. The motion occurs in a vertical plane where the string traces a cone, and the mass moves in a horizontal circular path.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Newton's second law for circular motion.  
- Centripetal force and its relation to tension and gravity.  
- Angular frequency and its connection to linear frequency.  
- Vector resolution of forces in two dimensions.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates kinematics (angular velocity and frequency) with dynamics (force resolution and Newton's laws). It reinforces the concept that centripetal force in uniform circular motion arises from net external forces, such as tension and gravity.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The conical pendulum model applies to engineering (e.g., stabilizing rotating machinery) and sports science (e.g., analyzing hammer-throw dynamics). It also connects to astronomy through orbital motion principles.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Amusement Rides**: Designs like the "swinging pirate ship" use conical pendulum principles to balance centripetal and gravitational forces.  
- **Centrifuges**: Separation of materials relies on horizontal circular motion where tension or support forces counteract gravity.  
- **Athletics**: Hammer throwers optimize release angles using similar force balances.  

**Problem Statement**  
A mass $m$ is attached to a string of length $L$. It is whirled in a horizontal circle at a constant frequency $f$, forming a conical pendulum. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$. Derive an expression for the tension $T$ in the string.  

**Requirements**  
- Start from Newton's second law and resolve forces vertically and horizontally.  
- Express $T$ symbolically in terms of $m$, $L$, $f$, $\pi$, and $g$.  
- Box your final expression for $T$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify Forces and Geometry**  
The forces acting on the mass are:  
- Tension $T$ along the string.  
- Weight $mg$ downward.  
The string makes an angle $\theta$ with the vertical. The horizontal component of tension provides the centripetal force, while the vertical component balances gravity. The radius $r$ of the circular path is:  
$$ r = L \sin \theta $$  

**Step 2: Vertical Force Equilibrium**  
No vertical acceleration → net vertical force = 0:  
$$ T \cos \theta = mg \quad (1) $$  

**Step 3: Horizontal Force (Centripetal Force)**  
Centripetal force is provided by the horizontal component of tension:  
$$ T \sin \theta = \frac{m v^2}{r} \quad (2) $$  
where $v$ is the linear speed.  

**Step 4: Relate Linear Speed to Frequency**  
Angular speed $\omega$ and frequency $f$ are related by:  
$$ \omega = 2 \pi f $$  
Linear speed $v$ is:  
$$ v = \omega r = 2 \pi f \cdot L \sin \theta $$  
Substitute $v$ into (2):  
$$ T \sin \theta = \frac{m (2 \pi f \cdot L \sin \theta)^2}{L \sin \theta} = m (2 \pi f)^2 L \sin \theta $$  
Simplify:  
$$ T \sin \theta = 4 \pi^2 f^2 m L \sin \theta \quad (3) $$  

**Step 5: Solve for Tension $T$**  
Divide both sides of (3) by $\sin \theta$ (assuming $\sin \theta \neq 0$):  
$$ T = 4 \pi^2 f^2 m L \quad (4) $$  

**Step 6: Verify Consistency with Gravity**  
From (1): $\cos \theta = \frac{mg}{T}$. Substitute $T$ from (4):  
$$ \cos \theta = \frac{mg}{4 \pi^2 f^2 m L} = \frac{g}{4 \pi^2 f^2 L} $$  
This defines $\theta$ but does not alter $T$, as $T$ is independent of $g$ in (4). The motion requires $g < 4 \pi^2 f^2 L$ to ensure $\cos \theta < 1$.  

**Conclusion**  
The tension $T$ is derived solely from the centripetal force requirement and is independent of $g$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{4\pi^{2} f^{2} m L}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**

In the world of extreme sports, stunt performers often execute thrilling maneuvers such as riding a motorcycle through a vertical loop. This scenario involves circular motion in a vertical plane, where centripetal force must be provided by a combination of gravitational and normal forces to keep the motorcycle on the track. At the top of the loop, the normal force can vanish, leading to a critical "weightless" condition that determines the minimum speed required to prevent detachment from the track.

**Knowledge Points Tested**
- Centripetal force in uniform circular motion.
- Newton's second law applied to vertical circular motion.
- Critical speed condition at the top of a vertical loop.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
This problem integrates kinematics and dynamics, emphasizing how forces govern motion in curved paths. It reinforces foundational mechanics concepts such as Newton's laws and energy considerations in rotational systems.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
The principles tested apply to roller coaster design (physics/engineering), orbital mechanics (astronomy), and biomechanics (e.g., analyzing circular motions in sports science).

**Real-World Applications**
Engineers use these calculations to design safe amusement park rides, ensuring vehicles maintain sufficient speed to stay on loops. Similarly, pilots and astronauts apply analogous principles during high-g maneuvers or orbital trajectories.

**Problem Statement**
A stunt motorcyclist attempts a vertical loop with a diameter of 6 m. Determine the minimum speed, in meters per second, that the motorcycle must have at the top of the loop to just maintain contact with the track. Use $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$ for the acceleration due to gravity. Round your answer to two decimal places.  
*Provide only the numerical value in your final answer.*

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify forces and apply Newton's second law**  
At the top of the loop, the motorcycle experiences:  
- Weight $mg$ downward (toward the center).  
- Normal force $N$ from the track downward.  

The net centripetal force is:  
$$ N + mg = \frac{mv^2}{R} $$  
where:  
- $m$ = mass of the motorcycle (cancels out later),  
- $v$ = speed at the top,  
- $R$ = radius of the loop.  

**Step 2: Establish minimum speed condition**  
The motorcycle just maintains contact when $N = 0$ (normal force vanishes). Substituting $N = 0$:  
$$ 0 + mg = \frac{mv_{\text{min}}^2}{R} $$  
Divide both sides by $m$:  
$$ g = \frac{v_{\text{min}}^2}{R} $$  

**Step 3: Solve for minimum speed**  
Rearrange to isolate $v_{\text{min}}$:  
$$ v_{\text{min}}^2 = gR $$  
$$ v_{\text{min}} = \sqrt{gR} $$  

**Step 4: Compute numerical value**  
Given:  
- Diameter $D = 6  \text{m} \implies R = \frac{D}{2} = 3  \text{m}$,  
- $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$.  
Substitute values:  
$$ v_{\text{min}} = \sqrt{(9.8) \cdot (3)} = \sqrt{29.4} \approx 5.422176684  \text{m/s} $$  
Rounded to two decimal places:  
$$ v_{\text{min}} = 5.42  \text{m/s} $$

$$\boxed{5.42}$$

# decay constants and half-life

## Problem 0
**Background**:  
Radioactive decay is a stochastic process where unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation. The decay rate is characterized by the half-life ($T_{1/2}$), the time required for half of the radioactive nuclei to decay. Activity ($A$), measured in becquerels (Bq), quantifies decays per second. Iodine-131 is a radioactive isotope used in nuclear medicine, with a half-life of 8 days. Understanding its decay kinetics is essential for safe handling and dosage calculations.

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
- Exponential decay models and the derivation of activity as a function of time.  
- Relationship between half-life and the decay constant ($\lambda$).  
- Application of logarithmic identities to simplify exponential expressions.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem reinforces core principles in nuclear physics, such as the universality of exponential decay, which also applies to capacitor discharge in electromagnetism and population decay in biology.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
The exponential decay model appears in pharmacokinetics (drug clearance in medicine), carbon dating (archaeology), and environmental science (pollutant degradation).  

**Real-World Applications**:  
Calculating residual activity is vital for radiation safety protocols, medical treatment planning (e.g., thyroid cancer therapy with I-131), and nuclear waste management.  

**Problem**:  
A sample of iodine-131 has an initial activity of $A_0 = 200  \text{Bq}$ and a half-life $T_{1/2} = 8  \text{days}$. Derive an expression for the activity $A(t)$ at time $t$ using the exponential decay law. Then, compute the activity after $t = 24  \text{days}$.  

Express your final answer as a numerical value in becquerels (Bq). Provide only the number, without units.

## Solution
**Step 1: Establish the decay model**  
Radioactive decay follows an exponential law:  
$$ A(t) = A_0 e^{-\lambda t} $$  
where $\lambda$ is the decay constant.  

**Step 2: Relate decay constant to half-life**  
By definition, when $t = T_{1/2}$, $A(T_{1/2}) = \frac{A_0}{2}$:  
$$ \frac{A_0}{2} = A_0 e^{-\lambda T_{1/2}} $$  
Divide both sides by $A_0$:  
$$ \frac{1}{2} = e^{-\lambda T_{1/2}} $$  
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:  
$$ \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\lambda T_{1/2} $$  
Simplify using $\ln(1/x) = -\ln(x)$:  
$$ -\ln(2) = -\lambda T_{1/2} $$  
Solve for $\lambda$:  
$$ \lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} $$  

**Step 3: Substitute $\lambda$ into the decay law**  
$$ A(t) = A_0 \exp\left(-\left[\frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}\right] t\right) $$  

**Step 4: Simplify using exponent properties**  
Rewrite the exponent:  
$$ A(t) = A_0 \exp\left(\ln(2) \cdot \left(-\frac{t}{T_{1/2}}\right)\right) $$  
Apply $e^{a \cdot b} = (e^a)^b$ and $e^{\ln(2)} = 2$:  
$$ A(t) = A_0 \left(2^{-\frac{t}{T_{1/2}}}\right) = A_0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{T_{1/2}}} $$  

**Step 5: Compute activity at $t = 24  \text{days}$**  
Substitute $A_0 = 200$, $T_{1/2} = 8$, $t = 24$:  
$$ A(24) = 200 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{24}{8}} = 200 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 $$  
Evaluate $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}$:  
$$ A(24) = 200 \times \frac{1}{8} = 25 $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{25}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
Radioactive decay is a fundamental process in nuclear physics where unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation. The decay constant, denoted by $\lambda$, characterizes the probability per unit time that a nucleus will decay. The half-life ($T_{1/2}$) is the time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay. Strontium-90 is a radioactive isotope produced in nuclear fission, with significant environmental and health implications due to its presence in nuclear fallout and long-term persistence in ecosystems.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Exponential decay law and its differential equation.  
- Relationship between decay constant and half-life.  
- Solving exponential equations using natural logarithms.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to calculus (solving differential equations) and algebra (logarithmic transformations). It reinforces the concept of exponential decay, which also appears in population dynamics and capacitor discharge in physics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Environmental Science**: Half-life determines the longevity of radioactive contaminants in soil and water.  
- **Medicine**: Strontium-90 accumulation in bones requires understanding decay rates for radiation risk assessment.  
- **Energy**: Nuclear waste management relies on half-life calculations for storage safety.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Predicting the duration of radioactivity in nuclear waste (e.g., Fukushima or Chernobyl cleanup).  
- Designing medical treatments using radioisotopes (e.g., cancer therapy with controlled radiation doses).  

**Problem Statement**  
The decay of a radioactive sample follows the law:  
$$\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N,$$  
where $N$ is the number of undecayed nuclei at time $t$, and $\lambda$ is the decay constant. For strontium-90, $\lambda = 0.0247$ per year. Derive an expression for the half-life $T_{1/2}$ in terms of $\lambda$ and fundamental constants. Then, compute the half-life of strontium-90.  
Express your answer in years, rounded to three significant digits. Provide only the numerical value.

## Solution
**Step 1: Solve the decay differential equation**  
The decay law is:  
$$\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N.$$  
Separate variables and integrate:  
$$\int \frac{dN}{N} = -\lambda \int dt,$$  
$$\ln|N| = -\lambda t + C.$$  
Exponentiate both sides:  
$$N = e^C e^{-\lambda t}.$$  
At $t = 0$, $N = N_0$, so $e^C = N_0$. Thus:  
$$N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}.$$  

**Step 2: Apply the half-life definition**  
At $t = T_{1/2}$, $N = \frac{N_0}{2}$:  
$$\frac{N_0}{2} = N_0 e^{-\lambda T_{1/2}}.$$  
Divide both sides by $N_0$:  
$$\frac{1}{2} = e^{-\lambda T_{1/2}}.$$  

**Step 3: Solve for $T_{1/2}$**  
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:  
$$\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\lambda T_{1/2},$$  
$$-\ln(2) = -\lambda T_{1/2}.$$  
Multiply both sides by $-1$:  
$$\ln(2) = \lambda T_{1/2}.$$  
Solve for $T_{1/2}$:  
$$T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{\lambda}.$$  

**Step 4: Substitute the given decay constant**  
For strontium-90, $\lambda = 0.0247$ per year. Using $\ln(2) \approx 0.693147$:  
$$T_{1/2} = \frac{0.693147}{0.0247}.$$  
Calculate:  
$$T_{1/2} \approx 28.06506.$$  
Round to three significant digits:  
$$T_{1/2} \approx 28.1.$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{28.1}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
Carbon-14 dating is a radiometric dating method used to determine the age of organic materials by measuring the decay of the radioactive isotope carbon-14 (C-14). Living organisms absorb carbon-14 from the atmosphere, but after death, the C-14 decays exponentially. The half-life ($T_{1/2}$) is the time required for half of the initial C-14 to decay. This process follows the exponential decay law, where the decay constant ($\lambda$) relates to the half-life through $\lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{T_{1/2}}$.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Exponential decay and half-life concepts
- Deriving the decay equation from first principles
- Solving exponential equations using natural logarithms
- Relating remaining fraction to time elapsed

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects exponential functions (algebra) to nuclear decay (physics). It reinforces logarithmic problem-solving techniques and demonstrates how decay constants model real-world phenomena like radioactive dating.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Carbon-14 dating is used in archaeology to date artifacts, in geology to determine fossil ages, and in climate science to study carbon cycles. Understanding decay constants helps analyze environmental changes and historical timelines.

Real-World Applications:
- Dating ancient artifacts (e.g., Egyptian mummies, Dead Sea Scrolls)
- Verifying historical timelines (e.g., Ötzi the Iceman's remains)
- Studying ocean circulation patterns through marine sediment dating

Problem:
An archaeologist discovers a fossilized tree branch with exactly 25% of its original carbon-14 content remaining. The half-life of carbon-14 is $T_{1/2}$ years.  
1. Starting from the exponential decay law, derive a general expression for the age ($t$) of the fossil in terms of $T_{1/2}$ and the remaining fraction $f = \frac{N}{N_0}$.  
2. Using $f = 0.25$ and $T_{1/2} = 5730$ years, compute the numerical age.  

Express the age in years as an exact integer. Use natural logarithms ($\ln$) in your derivation. For the final answer, provide only the numerical value without units.

## Solution
**Step 1: Establish the exponential decay model**  
The decay follows $N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$, where:  
- $N$ = current amount of C-14  
- $N_0$ = initial amount of C-14  
- $\lambda$ = decay constant  
- $t$ = time elapsed  

**Step 2: Relate decay constant to half-life**  
At $t = T_{1/2}$, $N = \frac{N_0}{2}$:  

$$
\frac{N_0}{2} = N_0 e^{-\lambda T_{1/2}}
$$
  
Divide both sides by $N_0$:  

$$
\frac{1}{2} = e^{-\lambda T_{1/2}}
$$
  
Take natural logarithm:  

$$
\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\lambda T_{1/2}
$$
  

$$
-\ln 2 = -\lambda T_{1/2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{T_{1/2}}
$$


**Step 3: General expression for age**  
Given remaining fraction $f = \frac{N}{N_0} = e^{-\lambda t}$:  

$$
f = e^{-\lambda t}
$$
  
Substitute $\lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{T_{1/2}}$:  

$$
f = \exp\left(-\frac{\ln 2}{T_{1/2}} t\right)
$$
  
Take natural logarithm:  

$$
\ln f = -\frac{\ln 2}{T_{1/2}} t
$$
  
Solve for $t$:  

$$
t = -\frac{\ln f}{\ln 2} \cdot T_{1/2}
$$
  
Simplify using logarithm properties ($\ln f = \ln(1/f)^{-1} = -\ln(1/f)$:  

$$
t = \frac{\ln(1/f)}{\ln 2} \cdot T_{1/2}
$$
  
Recognize $\frac{\ln(1/f)}{\ln 2} = \log_2(1/f)$:  

$$
t = T_{1/2} \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{1}{f}\right)
$$


**Step 4: Compute numerical age**  
Given $f = 0.25$ and $T_{1/2} = 5730$:  

$$
t = 5730 \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{1}{0.25}\right) = 5730 \cdot \log_2(4)
$$
  
Since $4 = 2^2$, $\log_2(4) = 2$:  

$$
t = 5730 \times 2 = 11460
$$
  
The age is exactly 11460 years.

## Answer
$$\boxed{11460}$$

## Problem 3
Background:
  Radioactive decay is a stochastic process where unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation. The decay follows an exponential law, characterized by the half-life (T) – the time required for half of the radioactive material to decay. This property is intrinsic to each isotope and is independent of initial mass. Understanding half-life is essential for applications like radiometric dating, nuclear medicine, and environmental monitoring.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  - Exponential decay model: $ M(t) = M_0 e^{-\lambda t} $, where $ M_0 $ = initial mass, $ \lambda $ = decay constant, t = time.
  - Relationship between half-life (T) and decay constant: $ T = \frac{\ln(2)}{\lambda} $.
  - Solving exponential equations using natural logarithms.
  - Logarithmic identity: $ \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) $.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  Connects to algebra (exponent rules, solving equations), calculus (derivatives of exponential functions), and probability (decay as a Poisson process). Extends to advanced topics like differential equations modeling decay rates.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  - Chemistry: Radioactive decay kinetics in nuclear chemistry.
  - Geology: Radiocarbon dating for determining the age of fossils/artifacts.
  - Medicine: Calculating dosage decay in radiotherapy (e.g., Iodine-131 treatment).
  - Environmental Science: Modeling decay of pollutants like Strontium-90 in ecosystems.

Real-World Applications:
  - Archaeology: Carbon-14 dating (half-life ≈ 5730 years) to estimate artifact ages.
  - Nuclear Medicine: Technetium-99m (half-life ≈ 6 hours) for diagnostic imaging.

Problem:
  A sample of an unknown radioactive element initially has mass $ M_0 $. After 80 days, the remaining mass is $ \frac{M_0}{16} $. Derive the half-life $ T $ (in days) of this element using the exponential decay model.  

  Instructions:
    1. Start from the exponential decay law.
    2. Use natural logarithms ($ \ln $) in your derivation.
    3. Express $ T $ as an integer.
    4. Provide only the numerical value in your final answer (unit: days).

  Note: The natural logarithm must be denoted as $ \ln $. Do not use $ \log $ for natural logarithm.

## Solution
**Step 1: State the exponential decay law**  
The mass at time $ t $ is given by:  
$$ M(t) = M_0 e^{-\lambda t} $$  
where $ \lambda $ is the decay constant.

**Step 2: Apply given conditions**  
At $ t = 80 $ days, $ M(80) = \frac{M_0}{16} $:  
$$ \frac{M_0}{16} = M_0 e^{-\lambda \cdot 80} $$  

Divide both sides by $ M_0 $:  
$$ \frac{1}{16} = e^{-80\lambda} $$  

**Step 3: Solve for $ \lambda $ using natural logarithms**  
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:  
$$ \ln\left(\frac{1}{16}\right) = \ln\left(e^{-80\lambda}\right) $$  
$$ \ln(1) - \ln(16) = -80\lambda $$  
Since $ \ln(1) = 0 $ and $ \ln(16) = \ln(2^4) = 4 \ln(2) $:  
$$ -4 \ln(2) = -80\lambda $$  
$$ \lambda = \frac{4 \ln(2)}{80} = \frac{\ln(2)}{20} $$  

**Step 4: Relate $ \lambda $ to half-life $ T $**  
By definition of half-life:  
$$ T = \frac{\ln(2)}{\lambda} $$  
Substitute $ \lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{20} $:  
$$ T = \frac{\ln(2)}{\frac{\ln(2)}{20}} = 20 $$  

**Conclusion**  
The half-life is exactly 20 days.

## Problem 4
**Background**  
Radioactive decay is a stochastic process where unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation. The half-life ($T$) of a radioactive isotope is the time required for half of the atoms in a sample to decay. The decay constant ($\lambda$) quantifies the decay rate and is related to half-life by $\lambda = \ln(2) / T$. Activity ($A$), defined as the decay rate, is given by $A = \lambda N$, where $N$ is the number of undecayed atoms. For an initial activity $A_0$, the activity at time $t$ follows $A(t) = A_0 e^{-\lambda t}$.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Relationship between half-life and decay constant.  
- Exponential decay of activity over time.  
- Solving equations involving exponential decay and ratios.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects decay dynamics to exponential functions and logarithms in mathematics. It also reinforces the concept of half-life in nuclear chemistry and physics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Mathematics**: Requires solving exponential equations using natural logarithms and algebraic manipulation.  
- **Environmental Science**: Models decay of pollutants or tracers with multiple isotopes.  
- **Medicine**: Applicable to radiopharmaceuticals used in diagnostics, where activity ratios impact dosing.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Nuclear Medicine**: Isotopes like technetium-99m (half-life ~6 hours) and iodine-131 (half-life ~8 days) are used in imaging. Understanding activity ratios ensures accurate diagnostics.  
- **Archaeology**: Carbon-14 dating (half-life ~5730 years) involves comparing isotope activities to determine artifact ages.  

**Problem Statement**  
Two radioactive isotopes, A and B, have half-lives of $T_A = 10$ hours and $T_B = 15$ hours, respectively. At time $t = 0$, their activities are equal. Determine the time $t$ (in hours) for the ratio of the activity of A to the activity of B to become $1:3$.  

Express your answer as an exact expression using the base-2 logarithm. Use $\ln$ for the natural logarithm and $\log_{2}$ for the base-2 logarithm. Do not evaluate numerically.

## Solution
The decay constants for isotopes A and B are derived from their half-lives:  

$$
\lambda_A = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_A}, \quad \lambda_B = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_B}.
$$


The activity of each isotope at time $t$ is:  

$$
A_A(t) = A_{A0} e^{-\lambda_A t}, \quad A_B(t) = A_{B0} e^{-\lambda_B t},
$$
  
where $A_{A0}$ and $A_{B0}$ are the initial activities. Given that activities are equal at $t = 0$:  

$$
A_{A0} = A_{B0}.
$$


The ratio of activities at time $t$ is:  

$$
\frac{A_A(t)}{A_B(t)} = \frac{A_{A0} e^{-\lambda_A t}}{A_{B0} e^{-\lambda_B t}}.
$$
  
Substituting $A_{A0} = A_{B0}$:  

$$
\frac{A_A(t)}{A_B(t)} = e^{-(\lambda_A - \lambda_B) t}.
$$


Set this ratio equal to $1/3$ (since $1:3$ implies $A_A/A_B = 1/3$):  

$$
e^{-(\lambda_A - \lambda_B) t} = \frac{1}{3}.
$$


Take the natural logarithm of both sides:  

$$
-(\lambda_A - \lambda_B) t = \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\ln(3).
$$
  
Solving for $t$:  

$$
(\lambda_A - \lambda_B) t = \ln(3) \implies t = \frac{\ln(3)}{\lambda_A - \lambda_B}.
$$


Substitute the expressions for $\lambda_A$ and $\lambda_B$:  

$$
\lambda_A - \lambda_B = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_A} - \frac{\ln(2)}{T_B} = \ln(2) \left( \frac{1}{T_A} - \frac{1}{T_B} \right) = \ln(2) \left( \frac{T_B - T_A}{T_A T_B} \right).
$$
  
Thus:  

$$
t = \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(2) \left( \frac{T_B - T_A}{T_A T_B} \right)} = \frac{\ln(3) \cdot T_A T_B}{\ln(2) \cdot (T_B - T_A)}.
$$


Insert the given half-lives $T_A = 10$ hours and $T_B = 15$ hours:  

$$
t = \frac{\ln(3) \cdot 10 \cdot 15}{\ln(2) \cdot (15 - 10)} = \frac{150 \ln(3)}{5 \ln(2)} = 30 \cdot \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(2)}.
$$


Recognize that $\frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(2)} = \log_{2}(3)$. Therefore:  

$$
t = 30 \log_{2}(3).
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{30 \log_{2} 3}$$

## Problem 5
Background:
  In a nuclear physics experiment, scientists observe the decay of a radioactive isotope. The initial activity of the sample is measured as 800 disintegrations per minute (dis/min). After precisely 90 minutes, the activity drops to 100 dis/min. Radioactive decay follows an exponential law governed by fundamental atomic processes, where the decay rate is characterized by a decay constant λ. The half-life $ T_{1/2} $—the time required for the activity to reduce by half—is a crucial property used in fields like radiometric dating, nuclear medicine, and environmental monitoring.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  - Exponential decay model for radioactive substances
  - Relationship between decay constant and half-life
  - Solving exponential equations using natural logarithms
  - Interpretation of activity measurements in disintegration rates

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  - Connects to atomic physics (quantum decay probabilities)
  - Extends to calculus (exponential functions and their derivatives)
  - Relates to statistics (Poisson distribution of decay events)

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  - Chemistry: Half-life calculations for reaction kinetics
  - Geology: Radiometric dating of rock samples
  - Medicine: Dosage calculations for radioactive tracers

Real-World Applications:
  - Carbon-14 dating in archaeology (measuring decay to determine artifact age)
  - Medical imaging (e.g., technetium-99m decay for organ scans)
  - Nuclear waste management (predicting radioactivity reduction over time)

Problem:
  Using the exponential decay law, derive the half-life $ T_{1/2} $ of the isotope. Start from the fundamental decay equation and express $ T_{1/2} $ in minutes. The decay process follows:
  
$$ A(t) = A_0 e^{-\lambda t} $$

  where:
    - $ A(t) $ is the activity at time $ t $,
    - $ A_0 $ is the initial activity,
    - $ \lambda $ is the decay constant.

  Given:
    - $ A_0 = 800 $ dis/min,
    - $ A(t) = 100 $ dis/min at $ t = 90 $ minutes.

  Express the half-life $ T_{1/2} $ as a numerical value in minutes. Provide only the numerical value in the box (without units), and ensure it is an exact integer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Write the decay equation with given values**  
Substitute the given data into the exponential decay law:  

$$
A(t) = A_0 e^{-\lambda t}
$$
  

$$
100 = 800 \cdot e^{-\lambda \cdot 90}
$$


**Step 2: Simplify the equation**  
Divide both sides by 800:  

$$
\frac{100}{800} = e^{-90\lambda}
$$
  

$$
\frac{1}{8} = e^{-90\lambda}
$$


**Step 3: Apply natural logarithm to solve for λ**  
Take the natural logarithm (base $e$) of both sides:  

$$
\ln\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) = \ln\left(e^{-90\lambda}\right)
$$
  

$$
\ln(1) - \ln(8) = -90\lambda
$$
  
Since $\ln(1) = 0$ and $\ln(8) = \ln(2^3) = 3\ln(2)$:  

$$
-3\ln(2) = -90\lambda
$$
  
Solve for $\lambda$:  

$$
\lambda = \frac{3\ln(2)}{90} = \frac{\ln(2)}{30}
$$


**Step 4: Relate decay constant to half-life**  
The half-life $T_{1/2}$ is defined as:  

$$
T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{\lambda}
$$
  
Substitute $\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{30}$:  

$$
T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{\frac{\ln(2)}{30}} = 30
$$


**Conclusion**  
The half-life of the radioactive isotope is exactly 30 minutes. This result aligns with the observation that the activity dropped by a factor of 8 (from 800 to 100), which corresponds to three half-lives ($2^3 = 8$) occurring over 90 minutes. Thus, one half-life is $90 / 3 = 30$ minutes.

## Answer
$$\boxed{30}$$

## Problem 6
**Background**:  
Radon-222 is a radioactive noble gas that occurs naturally in soil and rock, posing significant health risks when it accumulates indoors. Its decay follows an exponential law governed by a decay constant, with the half-life (denoted as $T$) representing the time required for half of the atoms to decay. Understanding decay dynamics is essential for assessing radiation exposure risks and designing mitigation strategies.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
- Derivation of the decay constant $\lambda$ from half-life $T$.  
- Application of exponential decay models to solve for time.  
- Use of logarithmic functions to invert exponential relationships.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
Connects to exponential functions (algebra), inverse operations (logarithms), and modeling real-world phenomena (physics). Reinforces the universality of exponential decay in contexts like capacitor discharge or chemical kinetics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
Links to environmental science (radon safety protocols) and public health (radiation dose assessment). Demonstrates mathematical modeling in biological half-lives of pharmaceuticals.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
Calculating safe re-entry times after radon mitigation in buildings, determining storage durations for radioactive materials, and calibrating radiation detectors.  

**Problem Statement**:  
The half-life of radon-222 is $T$. Derive a symbolic expression for the time $t$ required for a sample of radon-222 to decay to $\frac{1}{8}$ of its original amount. Use the following steps:  
1. Express the decay constant $\lambda$ in terms of $T$.  
2. Set up the exponential decay equation for the fraction $\frac{1}{8}$.  
3. Solve for $t$ in terms of $T$.  

**Requirements for Final Answer**:  
- Express $t$ solely in terms of $T$.  
- Use $\ln$ for natural logarithms (e.g., $\ln 2$). Do not use $\log$ for natural logs.  
- Simplify all logarithmic expressions explicitly.  
- Box your final expression.

## Solution
**Step 1: Relate decay constant $\lambda$ to half-life $T$**  
The half-life definition states that when $t = T$, the remaining fraction is $\frac{1}{2}$:  
$$ \frac{N}{N_0} = e^{-\lambda T} = \frac{1}{2} $$  
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:  
$$ \ln\left(e^{-\lambda T}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) $$  
$$ -\lambda T = -\ln 2 $$  
Solve for $\lambda$:  
$$ \lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{T} \quad (1) $$  

**Step 2: Set up the decay equation for $\frac{1}{8}$**  
The fraction $\frac{1}{8}$ at time $t$ is:  
$$ \frac{N}{N_0} = e^{-\lambda t} = \frac{1}{8} \quad (2) $$  

**Step 3: Solve for $t$**  
Take the natural logarithm of both sides of equation (2):  
$$ \ln\left(e^{-\lambda t}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) $$  
$$ -\lambda t = -\ln 8 $$  
$$ \lambda t = \ln 8 \quad (3) $$  
Substitute $\lambda$ from equation (1) into equation (3):  
$$ \left(\frac{\ln 2}{T}\right) t = \ln 8 $$  
Solve for $t$:  
$$ t = \frac{\ln 8 \cdot T}{\ln 2} \quad (4) $$  
Simplify $\ln 8$:  
$$ \ln 8 = \ln(2^3) = 3 \ln 2 $$  
Substitute into equation (4):  
$$ t = \frac{3 \ln 2 \cdot T}{\ln 2} = 3T $$  
The $\ln 2$ terms cancel, yielding:  
$$ t = 3T $$

# dimensional analysis in problem solving

## Problem 0
**Background:**  
A simple pendulum is a classic system in physics consisting of a small mass (bob) attached to a fixed point by a string of length $L$. When displaced from equilibrium and released, it undergoes periodic motion. The period $T$—the time for one complete oscillation—depends on $L$ and the acceleration due to gravity $g$. Dimensional analysis is a powerful tool to derive physical relationships by equating dimensions of relevant quantities, bypassing complex dynamics.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Fundamental dimensions (length, time, mass) and dimensional homogeneity.  
- Exponent balancing to derive physical laws.  
- Application of dimensional analysis to model oscillatory systems.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects to oscillation dynamics (e.g., harmonic motion) and the role of gravitational acceleration in mechanical systems.  
- Reinforces algebraic manipulation of exponents and roots.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- Used in engineering for scaling prototypes (e.g., simulating pendulum motion in reduced-scale models).  
- Applied in earth sciences to study gravity variations via pendulum periods.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Pendulum clocks: Period determines timekeeping accuracy; adjustments for $L$ compensate for local $g$ variations (e.g., altitude/latitude).  
- Seismometers: Pendulum-based sensors detect ground motion; dimensional analysis aids design.  

**Problem:**  
Using dimensional analysis, derive the expression for the period $T$ of a simple pendulum. Assume $T$ depends only on the length $L$ and gravitational acceleration $g$. Start with the proportionality $T \propto L^a g^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are real exponents. Equate dimensions to solve for $a$ and $b$, and express $T$ in terms of $L$, $g$, and a dimensionless constant $k$.  

Provide the **final expression for $T$** in the form $T = k \cdot \text{[expression]}$, where the expression is simplified using radicals or fractional exponents. Box only the expression inside the brackets (excluding $k$ and $T=$). Use $\sqrt{\cdot}$ for square roots.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify dimensions**  
- Period $[T] = \mathrm{T}$ (time).  
- Length $[L] = \mathrm{L}$ (length).  
- Gravitational acceleration $[g] = \mathrm{L} \mathrm{T}^{-2}$ (length/time²).  

**Step 2: Set up dimensional equation**  
Assume $T = k L^a g^b$, where $k$ is dimensionless. Equate dimensions:  

$$
[T] = [L]^a [g]^b \implies \mathrm{T} = \mathrm{L}^a (\mathrm{L} \mathrm{T}^{-2})^b = \mathrm{L}^a \cdot \mathrm{L}^b \mathrm{T}^{-2b} = \mathrm{L}^{a+b} \mathrm{T}^{-2b}.
$$


**Step 3: Equate exponents for each dimension**  
The left side has $\mathrm{L}^0 \mathrm{T}^1$. Thus:  
- For $\mathrm{L}$: $a + b = 0$  
- For $\mathrm{T}$: $-2b = 1$  

**Step 4: Solve the system of equations**  
From the time dimension:  

$$
-2b = 1 \implies b = -\frac{1}{2}.
$$
  
Substitute into the length dimension equation:  

$$
a + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 0 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}.
$$


**Step 5: Construct the expression for $T$**  
Substitute $a$ and $b$:  

$$
T = k L^{1/2} g^{-1/2} = k \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}.
$$
  
The dimensionless constant $k$ (later found to be $2\pi$ via calculus) is not determined by dimensional analysis.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**:  
Newton's law of gravitation describes the attractive force between two masses. It states that the magnitude of the gravitational force $F$ between two point masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by:  
$$ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$  
where $G$ is the **universal gravitational constant**. Dimensional analysis is a method to derive relationships between physical quantities by examining their fundamental dimensions (mass, length, and time).  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
- Newton's law of gravitation.  
- Fundamental dimensions: mass ($M$), length ($L$), time ($T$).  
- Dimensional analysis to derive the dimensions of a constant.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
- Connects to force ($F = ma$) and its dimensions $[M L T^{-2}]$.  
- Relates to dimensional consistency in equations across mechanics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
- Used in astrophysics to model celestial mechanics.  
- Applied in engineering for scaling physical systems (e.g., model testing in fluid dynamics).  

**Real-World Applications**:  
- Calculating planetary orbits, satellite trajectories, and gravitational waves.  
- Designing experiments to measure $G$, such as the Cavendish experiment.  

**Problem Statement**:  
Using Newton's law of gravitation, derive the dimensional formula for the universal gravitational constant $G$. Express the dimensions of $G$ in terms of the fundamental dimensions mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$).  

**Required Format**:  
- Express your answer as a dimensional formula in the form $[M^a L^b T^c]$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers.  
- Use only the symbols $M$, $L$, and $T$ with integer exponents.  
- Example format: $[M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}]$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Recall dimensions of force**  
Force $F$ is defined as mass $\times$ acceleration. Acceleration has dimensions $[L T^{-2}]$. Thus:  
$$ [F] = [M] \cdot [L T^{-2}] = [M L T^{-2}] $$  

**Step 2: Write Newton's law dimensionally**  
Newton's law is $ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $.  
- Dimensions of $m_1$ and $m_2$: $[M]$ each.  
- Dimensions of $r$: $[L]$.  
Thus, the right-hand side has dimensions:  
$$ [G] \cdot \frac{[M] \cdot [M]}{[L]^2} = [G] \cdot \frac{[M^2]}{[L^2]} $$  

**Step 3: Equate dimensions**  
For the equation to be dimensionally consistent, the dimensions of both sides must match:  
$$ [M L T^{-2}] = [G] \cdot \frac{[M^2]}{[L^2]} $$  

**Step 4: Solve for $[G]$**  
Rearrange to isolate $[G]$:  
$$ [G] = [M L T^{-2}] \cdot \frac{[L^2]}{[M^2]} = [M^{1-2} L^{1+2} T^{-2}] = [M^{-1} L^{3} T^{-2}] $$  

**Conclusion**:  
The dimensional formula for $G$ is $[M^{-1} L^{3} T^{-2}]$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{[M^{-1} L^{3} T^{-2}]}$$

## Problem 2
**Background:**  
Dimensional analysis is a fundamental tool in physics and engineering used to verify the consistency of equations by examining the dimensions of each term. The Bernoulli equation, which describes energy conservation in fluid flow, is given by:  
$$ P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho g h = \text{constant} $$  
where:  
- $P$ is pressure,  
- $\rho$ is fluid density,  
- $v$ is flow velocity,  
- $g$ is gravitational acceleration,  
- $h$ is height.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Dimensional analysis of physical quantities.  
- Verification of dimensional homogeneity in equations.  
- Identification of dimensionally inconsistent terms.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem connects to fluid dynamics (Bernoulli's principle) and classical mechanics (energy conservation). It reinforces how dimensional analysis ensures equations are physically meaningful.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
In engineering, dimensional consistency is critical for scaling prototypes (e.g., in aerodynamics or hydraulics). In mathematics, it relates to Buckingham Pi theorem for deriving dimensionless groups.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Validating equations in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, designing pipelines, and predicting pressure drops in HVAC systems.  

**Problem:**  
A student proposes a modified Bernoulli equation to include turbulence effects:  
$$ P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho g h + \kappa \rho v = \text{constant} $$  
where $\kappa$ is a dimensionless empirical constant. Verify the dimensional consistency of this equation. Identify any inconsistent term and correct it by multiplying by a factor with dimensions of time, denoted $T$. Provide the corrected term.  

**Requirements:**  
- Show that $P$, $\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2$, and $\rho g h$ share identical dimensions.  
- Prove the term $\kappa \rho v$ is dimensionally inconsistent.  
- Correct the inconsistent term using $T$.  
- **Express your final answer as the corrected term in terms of $\kappa$, $\rho$, $v$, and $T$.**

## Solution
**Step 1: Define fundamental dimensions**  
Use mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$):  
- Pressure $P$: Force per unit area. Force is $M \cdot L \cdot T^{-2}$, so:  
  $$ [P] = [M L^{-1} T^{-2}] $$  
- Density $\rho$: Mass per unit volume:  
  $$ [\rho] = [M L^{-3}] $$  
- Velocity $v$: Length per unit time:  
  $$ [v] = [L T^{-1}] $$  
- Gravitational acceleration $g$: Length per time squared:  
  $$ [g] = [L T^{-2}] $$  
- Height $h$: Length:  
  $$ [h] = [L] $$  

**Step 2: Verify dimensions of standard Bernoulli terms**  
- Term 1: Pressure $P$:  
  $$ [P] = [M L^{-1} T^{-2}] $$  
- Term 2: Kinetic energy density $\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2$:  
  $$ [\rho v^2] = [M L^{-3}] \cdot [L^2 T^{-2}] = [M L^{-1} T^{-2}] $$  
- Term 3: Potential energy density $\rho g h$:  
  $$ [\rho g h] = [M L^{-3}] \cdot [L T^{-2}] \cdot [L] = [M L^{-1} T^{-2}] $$  
All three terms have dimensions $[M L^{-1} T^{-2}]$, confirming consistency.  

**Step 3: Analyze the proposed term $\kappa \rho v$**  
- $\kappa$ is dimensionless: $[\kappa] = [1]$.  
- Dimensions of $\rho v$:  
  $$ [\rho v] = [M L^{-3}] \cdot [L T^{-1}] = [M L^{-2} T^{-1}] $$  
- Compare to $[M L^{-1} T^{-2}]$:  
  The exponents differ:  
  - $L^{-2}$ vs. $L^{-1}$ → inconsistent length dimension.  
  - $T^{-1}$ vs. $T^{-2}$ → inconsistent time dimension.  

**Step 4: Correct the term using $T$**  
- The inconsistent term $\kappa \rho v$ has dimensions $[M L^{-2} T^{-1}]$.  
- Target dimensions (matching pressure): $[M L^{-1} T^{-2}]$.  
- Multiply by a factor with dimensions $[L \cdot T^{-1}]$ to reconcile:  
  - $[M L^{-2} T^{-1}] \cdot [L \cdot T^{-1}] = [M L^{-1} T^{-2}]$.  
- A factor with dimensions of length/time is velocity, but the problem specifies using time $T$. Length can be expressed as velocity $\times$ time ($L = v T$), so:  
  $$ \text{Correction factor} = v T $$  
- Corrected term:  
  $$ \kappa \rho v \cdot (v T) = \kappa \rho v^2 T $$  

**Conclusion**  
The corrected term is $\kappa \rho v^2 T$, which now has dimensions $[M L^{-1} T^{-2}]$, consistent with all other terms.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\kappa \rho v^{2} T}$$

## Problem 3
Background:
  In the design of a new roller coaster, engineers must calculate the centripetal force that acts on the cars as they travel through a circular loop. This force depends on the mass of the car, its speed, and the radius of the loop. A junior engineer, who has forgotten the exact formula, decides to use dimensional analysis to derive the relationship.

  Dimensional analysis is a powerful tool that relies on the principle of dimensional homogeneity: any equation that describes a physical phenomenon must have the same dimensions on both sides. The fundamental dimensions are mass (M), length (L), and time (T). The dimensions of force are [M L T^{-2}], mass is [M], velocity (speed) is [L T^{-1}], and radius is [L].

  The engineer assumes that the centripetal force $ F $ is proportional to the mass $ m $ raised to the power $ a $, the velocity $ v $ raised to the power $ b $, and the radius $ r $ raised to the power $ c $. That is:

      
$$ F = k \cdot m^a \cdot v^b \cdot r^c $$


  where $ k $ is a dimensionless constant.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  - Understanding the dimensions of physical quantities.
  - Applying the principle of dimensional homogeneity to derive physical relationships.
  - Solving for unknown exponents by equating dimensions.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  This problem connects to Newton's laws of motion (specifically, the force required for circular motion) and the broader topic of dynamics in mechanics. It reinforces how dimensional analysis can derive relationships without invoking complex equations of motion.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  - Mathematics: Solving a system of linear equations (from the exponents) and working with exponents and dimensional algebra.
  - Engineering: Application to the design of safe and efficient amusement park rides, where force calculations impact structural integrity and passenger safety.

Real-World Applications:
  Dimensional analysis is used in various fields, such as:
    - Aerospace engineering: to predict the forces on scaled-down models of aircraft during wind tunnel testing.
    - Civil engineering: in the design of rotating structures (e.g., centrifuges, merry-go-rounds) that experience centripetal forces.
    - Biomechanics: to analyze forces on athletes during circular motions (e.g., hammer throw, cycling on velodromes).

Problem:
  Using dimensional analysis, derive the relationship between centripetal force $ F $ and the quantities mass $ m $, velocity $ v $, and radius $ r $. Express the centripetal force $ F $ in terms of $ m $, $ v $, and $ r $, ignoring the dimensionless constant $ k $.

  Format the final answer as a single mathematical expression using the variables $ m $, $ v $, and $ r $, with negative exponents for terms in the denominator. For example, if the expression were $ \frac{m v^2}{r} $, write it as $ m v^{2} r^{-1} $.

  Use the following LaTeX notation:
    - Variables: $ m $ for mass, $ v $ for velocity, $ r $ for radius.
    - Exponents: Use the caret symbol (^) with curly braces (e.g., $ v^{2} $, $ r^{-1} $).
    - Multiplication: Use implicit multiplication (e.g., $ m v^{2} r^{-1} $, not $ m \times v^{2} \times r^{-1} $).

  Your final answer must be the expression only, without $ k $ or the proportionality symbol.

## Solution
To derive the relationship for centripetal force $ F $ using dimensional analysis, assume $ F $ is proportional to the product of powers of mass $ m $, velocity $ v $, and radius $ r $:


$$
F = k \cdot m^a \cdot v^b \cdot r^c
$$


where $ k $ is a dimensionless constant. The dimensions must be consistent on both sides. The dimensions of force $ F $ are $[F] = [\text{M} \text{L} \text{T}^{-2}]$. The dimensions of the variables are:
- Mass $ m $: $[m] = [\text{M}]$
- Velocity $ v $: $[v] = [\text{L} \text{T}^{-1}]$
- Radius $ r $: $[r] = [\text{L}]$

The dimensions of the right-hand side are:


$$
[k] \cdot [m^a] \cdot [v^b] \cdot [r^c] = [\text{M}]^a \cdot ([\text{L} \text{T}^{-1}])^b \cdot [\text{L}]^c = \text{M}^a \cdot \text{L}^{b} \text{T}^{-b} \cdot \text{L}^{c} = \text{M}^a \cdot \text{L}^{b+c} \cdot \text{T}^{-b}
$$


Equate this to the dimensions of force $[\text{M} \text{L} \text{T}^{-2}]$:


$$
\text{M}^a \cdot \text{L}^{b+c} \cdot \text{T}^{-b} = \text{M}^1 \text{L}^1 \text{T}^{-2}
$$


Equate the exponents for each fundamental dimension:

1. **Mass (M):**  
   $ a = 1 $

2. **Length (L):**  
   $ b + c = 1 $

3. **Time (T):**  
   $ -b = -2 $ → $ b = 2 $

Substitute $ b = 2 $ into the length equation:  
$ 2 + c = 1 $ → $ c = 1 - 2 = -1 $

Thus, the exponents are $ a = 1 $, $ b = 2 $, and $ c = -1 $. The expression for centripetal force (ignoring the dimensionless constant $ k $) is:


$$
m^a v^b r^c = m^1 v^{2} r^{-1}
$$


This shows that $ F \propto m v^{2} r^{-1} $.

## Answer
$$\boxed{m v^{2} r^{-1}}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**  
When a small sphere moves through a viscous fluid, it experiences a drag force due to the fluid's resistance. This force, known as the viscous force, is critical in applications ranging from sedimentation in environmental science (e.g., pollutant particles settling in water) to biomedical engineering (e.g., blood flow in capillaries). The force depends on the fluid's dynamic viscosity (η), the sphere's radius (R), and its velocity (v) relative to the fluid.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Dimensional analysis to derive physical laws.  
- Fundamental dimensions: mass (M), length (L), time (T).  
- Proportionality reasoning and dimensionless constants.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to fluid dynamics (viscous flow), Newtonian mechanics (force-velocity relationships), and continuum mechanics (stress-strain behavior in fluids).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Chemistry/Chemical Engineering**: Viscosity measurements in non-Newtonian fluids.  
- **Environmental Science**: Modeling the settling velocity of aerosols or sediments.  
- **Medicine**: Analyzing cell motility in microfluidic devices.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Viscometry**: Determining fluid viscosity by measuring the terminal velocity of falling spheres.  
- **Industrial Processes**: Designing filters for wastewater treatment based on particle settling rates.  
- **Meteorology**: Calculating raindrop terminal velocity in atmospheric models.  

**Problem**  
Using dimensional analysis, derive the expression for the viscous force $F$ on a sphere in terms of the dynamic viscosity $\eta$, radius $R$, and velocity $v$. Assume $F$ is proportional to $\eta^a R^b v^c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are exponents determined by dimensional consistency. After finding the form $F \propto \eta^a R^b v^c$, incorporate the dimensionless constant $6\pi$ (experimentally validated for spheres) to write the complete formula.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Express the force $F$ as a symbolic expression in terms of $\eta$, $R$, and $v$, and include the constant $6\pi$. Do not substitute numerical values or include units. Use the notation:  
- $\eta$ for viscosity,  
- $R$ for radius,  
- $v$ for velocity.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify dimensions of all quantities**  
- Force $F$: $[F] = [\text{M} \text{L} \text{T}^{-2}]$  
- Dynamic viscosity $\eta$: Viscosity relates shear stress ($\tau$) to velocity gradient ($\frac{dv}{dy}$). Shear stress has dimensions $[\tau] = [\text{M} \text{L}^{-1} \text{T}^{-2}]$, and velocity gradient has dimensions $[\frac{dv}{dy}] = [\text{T}^{-1}]$. Thus:  
  $$
  [\eta] = \frac{[\tau]}{[dv/dy]} = \frac{[\text{M} \text{L}^{-1} \text{T}^{-2}]}{[\text{T}^{-1}]} = [\text{M} \text{L}^{-1} \text{T}^{-1}]
  $$  
- Radius $R$: $[R] = [\text{L}]$  
- Velocity $v$: $[v] = [\text{L} \text{T}^{-1}]$  

**Step 2: Set up proportionality equation**  
Assume $F \propto \eta^a R^b v^c$. Equate dimensions:  
$$
[F] = [\eta]^a [R]^b [v]^c
$$  
Substitute dimensions:  
$$
[\text{M} \text{L} \text{T}^{-2}] = ([\text{M} \text{L}^{-1} \text{T}^{-1}])^a \cdot ([\text{L}])^b \cdot ([\text{L} \text{T}^{-1}])^c
$$  

**Step 3: Solve for exponents**  
Expand the right-hand side:  
$$
[\text{M}]^a [\text{L}]^{-a} [\text{T}]^{-a} \cdot [\text{L}]^b \cdot [\text{L}]^c [\text{T}]^{-c} = [\text{M}]^a [\text{L}]^{-a + b + c} [\text{T}]^{-a - c}
$$  
Equate exponents for each dimension:  
- **Mass (M)**: $a = 1$  
- **Length (L)**: $-a + b + c = 1$  
- **Time (T)**: $-a - c = -2$  

Substitute $a = 1$ into the time equation:  
$$
-1 - c = -2 \implies c = 1
$$  
Substitute $a = 1$ and $c = 1$ into the length equation:  
$$
-1 + b + 1 = 1 \implies b = 1
$$  
Thus, $a = 1$, $b = 1$, $c = 1$.  

**Step 4: Write the proportional relationship**  
$$
F \propto \eta^1 R^1 v^1 = \eta R v
$$  

**Step 5: Include the dimensionless constant**  
Experimental results for spheres in viscous flow yield a constant $6\pi$. The complete formula is:  
$$
F = 6\pi \eta R v
$$  
This is **Stokes' law** for viscous force on a sphere.

## Answer
$$\boxed{6\pi \eta R v}$$

## Problem 5
**Background**  
Dimensional analysis is a powerful tool in physics to verify the correctness of equations by checking the consistency of physical dimensions. Physical quantities are expressed in terms of base dimensions: mass [M], length [L], and time [T]. For example, velocity has dimensions [L][T]⁻¹, and force has dimensions [M][L][T]⁻². The universal gravitational constant $G$ appears in Newton’s law of gravitation and has dimensions [M]⁻¹[L]³[T]⁻².  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Identifying dimensions of physical quantities.  
- Applying the principle of homogeneity: all terms in an equation must have identical dimensions.  
- Solving systems of equations derived from dimensional consistency.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to classical mechanics (gravitation and kinematics) and mathematical modeling. Dimensional analysis underpins derivations of physical laws, such as orbital velocity and fluid dynamics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Dimensional analysis is used in engineering (e.g., scaling prototypes in wind tunnels) and environmental science (e.g., modeling pollutant dispersion).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Space agencies use escape velocity calculations to design spacecraft trajectories. For example, NASA’s missions to Mars rely on precise velocity requirements derived from dimensional principles.  

**Problem Statement**  
The escape velocity $v_e$ for an object to leave a planet’s gravitational field depends on the gravitational constant $G$, the planet’s mass $M$, and its radius $R$. Suppose $v_e$ is modeled as:  
$$ v_e = k \cdot G^a M^b R^c $$  
where $k$ is a dimensionless constant. Using dimensional analysis, determine the exponents $a$, $b$, and $c$. Then, compute the value of the expression $a \times b \times c$.  

Express the final answer as a simplified fraction.  

**Note**  
- Base dimensions: [M] for mass, [L] for length, [T] for time.  
- Dimensions of $G$: [M]⁻¹[L]³[T]⁻².  
- Dimensions of escape velocity: [L][T]⁻¹.

## Solution
**Step 1: Express dimensions of all quantities**  
- Escape velocity: $[v_e] = [L][T]^{-1}$  
- Gravitational constant: $[G] = [M]^{-1}[L]^{3}[T]^{-2}$  
- Mass: $[M] = [M]$  
- Radius: $[R] = [L]$  
- The constant $k$ is dimensionless, so $[k] = 1$.  

**Step 2: Apply dimensional homogeneity**  
The right-hand side has dimensions:  
$$ [k \cdot G^a M^b R^c] = [G]^a [M]^b [R]^c = \left([M]^{-1}[L]^{3}[T]^{-2}\right)^a \cdot [M]^b \cdot [L]^c $$  
Simplify:  
$$ = [M]^{-a}[L]^{3a}[T]^{-2a} \cdot [M]^b \cdot [L]^c = [M]^{-a + b} [L]^{3a + c} [T]^{-2a} $$  
Set equal to $[v_e]$:  
$$ [M]^{-a + b} [L]^{3a + c} [T]^{-2a} = [M]^0 [L]^1 [T]^{-1} $$  

**Step 3: Solve for exponents**  
Equate exponents for each base dimension:  
- For [M]: $-a + b = 0$  
- For [L]: $3a + c = 1$  
- For [T]: $-2a = -1$  

Solve the system:  
1. From [T]: $-2a = -1$ → $a = \frac{1}{2}$  
2. Substitute $a = \frac{1}{2}$ into [M]: $-\frac{1}{2} + b = 0$ → $b = \frac{1}{2}$  
3. Substitute $a = \frac{1}{2}$ into [L]: $3 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + c = 1$ → $\frac{3}{2} + c = 1$ → $c = 1 - \frac{3}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}$  

**Step 4: Compute $a \times b \times c$**  
$$ a \times b \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{1}{8} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{-\dfrac{1}{8}}$$

## Problem 6
**Background:**  
Planck's constant, denoted by $h$, is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics. It emerged from Max Planck's solution to the "ultraviolet catastrophe" in blackbody radiation. The constant relates the energy $E$ of a single photon to the frequency $\nu$ (Greek letter "nu") of its associated electromagnetic wave via $E = h\nu$. Frequency $\nu$ represents the number of wave cycles per unit time. Dimensional analysis—a method to express physical quantities in terms of fundamental dimensions like mass (M), length (L), and time (T)—allows us to derive the dimensions of $h$ without numerical values.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Interpretation of physical equations through dimensional analysis.  
- Relationship between energy, frequency, and Planck's constant.  
- Fundamental dimensions (M, L, T) and their role in describing physical quantities.

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects classical wave properties (frequency) to quantum energy quantization.  
- Relates to conservation laws (energy) and electromagnetic wave theory.

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Chemistry:** Photon energy governs chemical reactions in photochemistry.  
- **Engineering:** Essential for designing lasers, LEDs, and photovoltaic cells.

**Real-World Applications:**  
- **Solar Panels:** Photon energy (via $E = h\nu$) determines electron ejection efficiency.  
- **Medical Imaging:** X-ray photon energy depends on frequency $\nu$, affecting penetration depth.

**Problem Statement:**  
Using the energy-frequency relation $E = h\nu$, where $E$ is energy and $\nu$ is frequency:  
(a) Derive the dimensions of Planck's constant $h$ in terms of the fundamental dimensions mass (M), length (L), and time (T).  
(b) The speed of light $c$ has dimensions $\mathrm{L} \mathrm{T}^{-1}$. If a new constant $k$ is defined by $k = hc$, derive the dimensions of $k$.  

Express all answers in the form $\mathrm{M}^a \mathrm{L}^b \mathrm{T}^c$ with explicit integer exponents $a$, $b$, $c$. For part (b), combine exponents (e.g., $\mathrm{L}^2 \mathrm{T}^{-2}$, not $\mathrm{L}^2 \mathrm{T}^{-1} \mathrm{T}^{-1}$).

## Solution
**Part (a): Dimensions of $h$**  
1. **Dimensions of energy $E$:**  
   Energy has the same dimensions as work, defined as force $\times$ distance. Force is mass $\times$ acceleration, so:  
   $$[E] = [\text{force}] \times [\text{distance}] = (\mathrm{M} \mathrm{L} \mathrm{T}^{-2}) \times \mathrm{L} = \mathrm{M} \mathrm{L}^2 \mathrm{T}^{-2}.$$  

2. **Dimensions of frequency $\nu$:**  
   Frequency is cycles per unit time, so:  
   $$[\nu] = \mathrm{T}^{-1}.$$  

3. **Solve for $[h]$ using $E = h\nu$:**  
   $$[E] = [h] \times [\nu] \implies \mathrm{M} \mathrm{L}^2 \mathrm{T}^{-2} = [h] \times \mathrm{T}^{-1}.$$  
   Rearranging for $[h]$:  
   $$[h] = \frac{\mathrm{M} \mathrm{L}^2 \mathrm{T}^{-2}}{\mathrm{T}^{-1}} = \mathrm{M} \mathrm{L}^2 \mathrm{T}^{-1}.$$  

**Part (b): Dimensions of $k = hc$**  
1. **Dimensions of speed of light $c$:**  
   Given $[c] = \mathrm{L} \mathrm{T}^{-1}$.  

2. **Dimensions of $h$ from part (a):**  
   $$[h] = \mathrm{M} \mathrm{L}^2 \mathrm{T}^{-1}.$$  

3. **Dimensions of $k = hc$:**  
   $$[k] = [h] \times [c] = (\mathrm{M} \mathrm{L}^2 \mathrm{T}^{-1}) \times (\mathrm{L} \mathrm{T}^{-1}) = \mathrm{M} \mathrm{L}^{3} \mathrm{T}^{-2}.$$  

**Dimensional consistency verified:**  
- Both derivations use fundamental dimensions without numerical values.  
- Algebraic operations on exponents follow standard rules.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\mathrm{M} \mathrm{L}^{2} \mathrm{T}^{-1}}$$  
$$\boxed{\mathrm{M} \mathrm{L}^{3} \mathrm{T}^{-2}}$$

## Problem 7
**Background**  
The speed of waves traveling along a string is crucial in applications like musical instruments (e.g., guitar strings) and seismic monitoring cables. Wave speed $v$ depends on the string's tension $T$ (the force stretching it) and linear mass density $\mu$ (mass per unit length). Dimensional analysis—a method to relate physical quantities by their fundamental dimensions (mass, length, time)—can derive this relationship without solving complex equations.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Dimensional analysis: Equating dimensions to establish physical relationships.  
2. Fundamental dimensions: Mass ($[M]$), length ($[L]$), time ($[T]$).  
3. Wave properties: Speed as a function of tension and linear density.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This connects to wave mechanics (e.g., sound waves in air, where speed depends on elasticity and density) and Newtonian dynamics (tension as a force governed by Newton’s second law).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Music**: Wave speed determines the fundamental frequency of a string, affecting pitch.  
- **Engineering**: Designing cables for bridges or elevators requires controlling wave speeds to avoid resonant vibrations.  

**Real-World Applications**  
1. **Musical tuning**: Adjusting tension $T$ changes wave speed to achieve desired notes.  
2. **Geophysics**: Measuring wave speeds on cables helps detect subsurface structures in oil exploration.  

**Problem Statement**  
Using dimensional analysis, derive the expression for the wave speed $v$ on a string in terms of the tension $T$ and linear mass density $\mu$. Assume $v$ depends only on $T$ and $\mu$, and has the form:  

$$ v = C \cdot T^a \cdot \mu^b, $$
  
where $C$ is a dimensionless constant. Determine the exponents $a$ and $b$. Experimental results confirm $C = 1$ for ideal strings. Thus, express $v$ solely in terms of $T$ and $\mu$.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Provide the expression for $v$ in terms of $T$ and $\mu$. Use `\sqrt{}` for square roots and express fractions as `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`. Do not include $v =$, constants, or units. Example: If the answer were $T \mu$, you would write `T\mu`.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify dimensions of each quantity.**  
- Wave speed $v$: Speed has dimensions $[L][T]^{-1}$.  
- Tension $T$: Force has dimensions $[M][L][T]^{-2}$ (since force = mass × acceleration).  
- Linear mass density $\mu$: Mass per unit length has dimensions $[M][L]^{-1}$.  
- Dimensionless constant $C$: $[C] = 1$ (no dimensions).  

**Step 2: Set up dimensional equation.**  
Assume $v = C \cdot T^a \cdot \mu^b$. Equate dimensions:  

$$
[L][T]^{-1} = \left( [M][L][T]^{-2} \right)^a \cdot \left( [M][L]^{-1} \right)^b \cdot [C].
$$
  
Since $[C] = 1$, simplify to:  

$$
[L]^1 [T]^{-1} [M]^0 = [M]^a [L]^a [T]^{-2a} \cdot [M]^b [L]^{-b}.
$$
  
Combine exponents:  

$$
[M]^{a+b} [L]^{a-b} [T]^{-2a} = [L]^1 [T]^{-1} [M]^0.
$$
  

**Step 3: Equate exponents for each dimension.**  
- For $[M]$: $a + b = 0$.  
- For $[L]$: $a - b = 1$.  
- For $[T]$: $-2a = -1$.  

**Step 4: Solve for exponents $a$ and $b$.**  
- From $[T]$: $-2a = -1$ → $a = \frac{1}{2}$.  
- From $[M]$: $\frac{1}{2} + b = 0$ → $b = -\frac{1}{2}$.  
- Verify $[L]$: $\frac{1}{2} - (-\frac{1}{2}) = 1$ → holds.  

**Step 5: Write general form and apply $C = 1$.**  
Substitute $a$ and $b$:  

$$
v = C \cdot T^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot \mu^{-\frac{1}{2}} = C \cdot \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}.
$$
  
Given $C = 1$ experimentally:  

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}.
$$
  
This matches the wave equation solution and empirical observations.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}}$$

# displacement and distance from path data

## Problem 0
**Background:**  
In navigation and robotics, understanding the path taken by an object is crucial for tasks like localization and motion planning. Displacement represents the straight-line distance between the initial and final positions (a vector quantity), while distance traveled is the total path length covered (a scalar quantity). These concepts are fundamental in kinematics and vector analysis.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Vector decomposition into components.  
- Calculation of displacement magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem.  
- Summation of scalar distances for total path length.  
- Trigonometric functions for directional moves.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects to vector algebra (component-wise addition) and coordinate geometry (position tracking in 2D planes).  
- Extends 1D displacement concepts to 2D, emphasizing vector nature.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- Robotics: Path efficiency analysis for autonomous vehicles.  
- Geography: Tracking movement in grid-based navigation systems.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Drone delivery routes (e.g., Amazon Prime Air).  
- GPS tracking in hiking or marine navigation.  

**Problem Statement:**  
A drone starts at the origin $(0, 0)$ of a Cartesian coordinate system, where the positive $x$-axis points east and the positive $y$-axis points north. It executes the following moves in sequence:  
1. Flies $a$ meters due east.  
2. Flies $a$ meters due north.  
3. Flies $a$ meters at an angle of 120 degrees counterclockwise from the positive $x$-axis.  

Find the ratio of the magnitude of the drone's displacement (from start to end) to the total distance traveled.  
- **Use degrees for angles** (omit the degree symbol; e.g., $\cos(120)$).  
- Express your answer as a **single simplified fraction** with radicals.

## Solution
**Step 1: Break moves into components.**  
- Move 1 (east): $\Delta x_1 = a$, $\Delta y_1 = 0$.  
- Move 2 (north): $\Delta x_2 = 0$, $\Delta y_2 = a$.  
- Move 3 (120° from $+x$-axis):  
  
$$
  \Delta x_3 = a \cos(120) = a \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{a}{2},
  $$

  
$$
  \Delta y_3 = a \sin(120) = a \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{a\sqrt{3}}{2}.
  $$
  

**Step 2: Compute net displacement components.**  
- Net $x$-displacement:  
  
$$
  \Delta x_{\text{net}} = a + 0 - \frac{a}{2} = \frac{a}{2}.
  $$
  
- Net $y$-displacement:  
  
$$
  \Delta y_{\text{net}} = 0 + a + \frac{a\sqrt{3}}{2} = a \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).
  $$
  

**Step 3: Calculate displacement magnitude.**  

$$
|\vec{d}| = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{a}{2} \right)^2 + \left( a \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \right)^2 }.
$$
  
Simplify the expression inside the square root:  

$$
\left( \frac{a}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{4},
$$
  

$$
\left( a \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \right)^2 = a^2 \left(1 + \sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{4}\right) = a^2 \left(\frac{7}{4} + \sqrt{3}\right).  \quad \left[ \text{since } \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1 + 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1 + \sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{4} \right]
$$
  
Add the terms:  

$$
\frac{a^2}{4} + a^2 \left(\frac{7}{4} + \sqrt{3}\right) = a^2 \left( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{7}{4} + \sqrt{3} \right) = a^2 \left(2 + \sqrt{3}\right).
$$
  
Thus,  

$$
|\vec{d}| = \sqrt{ a^2 (2 + \sqrt{3}) } = a \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}.
$$
  

**Step 4: Compute total distance traveled.**  

$$
\text{Distance} = a + a + a = 3a.
$$
  

**Step 5: Find the ratio.**  

$$
\text{Ratio} = \frac{|\vec{d}|}{\text{Distance}} = \frac{a \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}}{3a} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}}{3}.
$$
  
Simplify the expression by rationalizing $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}$:  

$$
\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{4 + 2\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad \left[ \text{since } \left( \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{12} + 2}{4} = \frac{8 + 4\sqrt{3}}{4} = 2 + \sqrt{3} \right]
$$
  
Substitute:  

$$
\text{Ratio} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{6}.
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{6}}$$

## Problem 1
Background: In robotics, navigation relies on precise movement vectors and coordinate systems. Consider a robot starting at the origin of a Cartesian plane where the positive x-axis points east and the positive y-axis points north. The robot executes this sequence:  
1. Move 10 m due north.  
2. Move 5 m due east.  
3. Move 10 m due south.  

Due to a compass calibration error, the third movement deviates 30° west of south instead of true south.

Calculate the magnitude of the robot’s total displacement from the origin. Express the numerical value as a simplified radical expression. The unit is meters, but provide only the numerical expression in your answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define displacement vectors**  
- Movement 1 (10 m north): $\vec{d_1} = (0, 10)$  
- Movement 2 (5 m east): $\vec{d_2} = (5, 0)$  
- Movement 3 (10 m at 30° west of south):  
  Direction = 240° from positive x-axis (since south = 270°; 30° west → 270° + 30° = 300°? No: standard position angles increase counterclockwise from east. South is 270°, and 30° west of south is 240° because moving clockwise from south to west decreases the angle).  
  Components:  
  
$$
  d_{3x} = 10 \cos(240^\circ) = 10 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -5
  $$

  
$$
  d_{3y} = 10 \sin(240^\circ) = 10 \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -5\sqrt{3}
  $$

  Thus, $\vec{d_3} = (-5, -5\sqrt{3})$  

**Step 2: Compute total displacement vector**  
Sum components:  

$$
\vec{d_{\text{total}}} = \vec{d_1} + \vec{d_2} + \vec{d_3} = (0 + 5 - 5, 10 + 0 - 5\sqrt{3}) = (0, 10 - 5\sqrt{3})
$$
  

**Step 3: Calculate displacement magnitude**  
Magnitude is the Euclidean norm:  

$$
|\vec{d_{\text{total}}}| = \sqrt{(0)^2 + (10 - 5\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{(10 - 5\sqrt{3})^2} = |10 - 5\sqrt{3}|
$$
  
Since $5\sqrt{3} \approx 8.660 < 10$, the expression is positive:  

$$
|\vec{d_{\text{total}}}| = 10 - 5\sqrt{3} = 5(2 - \sqrt{3})
$$
  

**Numerical verification (not part of final answer):**  
$5(2 - \sqrt{3}) \approx 5(2 - 1.7320508) = 5 \times 0.2679492 = 1.339746$  
Rounded to six significant digits: 1.33975  

**Distance traveled (for completeness):**  
Scalar sum: $10 + 5 + 10 = 25$ m (not displacement).

## Answer
$$\boxed{5\left(2 - \sqrt{3}\right)}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
A car is testing a new multi-lane circular race track with three concentric lanes. The innermost lane has radius $ R - d $, the middle lane has radius $ R $, and the outermost lane has radius $ R + d $, where $ R $ is the radius of the middle lane and $ d $ is the lane width. The car starts at the starting line (angular position 0°) on the innermost lane. It completes one full lap on the innermost lane, then instantly moves to the middle lane at the same angular position (0°) and completes one full lap, then instantly moves to the outermost lane at 0° and completes one full lap. The car stops at the starting line position of the outermost lane. Lane changes are instantaneous and add no distance to the path. The motion occurs in a 2D plane with the track center at the origin.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Calculation of total distance traveled as the sum of path segments (circumferences).
2. Displacement magnitude as the Euclidean distance between initial and final positions.
3. Coordinate representation of circular paths and vector subtraction.
4. Ratio formulation combining displacement and distance.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
Connects circular motion (kinematics) with vector displacement in physics, and algebraic simplification in mathematics. Reinforces the distinction between scalar distance (path length) and vector displacement (shortest path).

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Applies geometry (circle properties, coordinate systems) to a physics-based scenario. The ratio derived has implications in engineering for optimizing race track designs and robotics for path efficiency analysis.

Real-World Applications:
Models pit-stop strategies in motorsports (e.g., Formula 1) where lane changes affect net positioning. Also relevant to navigation systems calculating "as-the-crow-flies" distance versus actual path distance in circular routes.

Problem Statement:
Derive an expression for the ratio of the magnitude of the car's displacement to the total distance traveled. Express your answer in simplified form in terms of $ R $ and $ d $.

Note: 
- Displacement is the straight-line distance from start to end point.
- Final answer must be a single fraction or simplified expression.
- Use Cartesian coordinates with the track center at (0,0) and starting line along the positive x-axis.

## Solution
**Step 1: Calculate total distance traveled**  
The total distance is the sum of the circumferences of the three lanes:  
- Innermost lane circumference: $ 2\pi (R - d) $  
- Middle lane circumference: $ 2\pi R $  
- Outermost lane circumference: $ 2\pi (R + d) $  
Total distance $ s $:  

$$
s = 2\pi (R - d) + 2\pi R + 2\pi (R + d) = 2\pi R - 2\pi d + 2\pi R + 2\pi R + 2\pi d = 6\pi R
$$
  
The $ -2\pi d $ and $ +2\pi d $ terms cancel, leaving $ s = 6\pi R $.

**Step 2: Calculate displacement magnitude**  
- Initial position (innermost lane, 0°): Cartesian coordinates $ \big( R - d,\ 0 \big) $.  
- Final position (outermost lane, 0°): Cartesian coordinates $ \big( R + d,\ 0 \big) $.  
Displacement vector $ \vec{\Delta r} $:  

$$
\vec{\Delta r} = \big( (R + d) - (R - d),\ 0 - 0 \big) = (2d,\ 0)
$$
  
Magnitude of displacement $ |\vec{\Delta r}| $:  

$$
|\vec{\Delta r}| = \sqrt{(2d)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{4d^2} = 2d
$$
  
(Since $ d > 0 $, absolute value is redundant.)

**Step 3: Compute the ratio**  
Ratio $ \rho $ of displacement magnitude to total distance:  

$$
\rho = \frac{|\vec{\Delta r}|}{s} = \frac{2d}{6\pi R} = \frac{d}{3\pi R}
$$
  
The expression $ \frac{d}{3\pi R} $ is already simplified.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{d}{3\pi R}}$$

## Problem 3
**Background**  
In urban navigation, people often traverse city blocks arranged in a grid. The displacement is the straight-line distance from the starting point to the ending point, while the distance traveled is the total path length. This problem explores these concepts using vector addition and the Pythagorean theorem.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Vector decomposition in Cartesian coordinates (east-west and north-south components).  
2. Magnitude of a displacement vector using the Pythagorean theorem.  
3. Total distance traveled as the sum of individual path segments.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to vector mathematics (addition and magnitude) and kinematics (distinguishing distance from displacement). It reinforces the geometric interpretation of vectors in physics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
In geography and urban planning, grid-based navigation models help optimize routes. In computer science, similar logic underpins pathfinding algorithms like A*.  

**Real-World Applications**  
GPS devices compute displacement for "as-the-crow-flies" navigation and distance for route planning. Delivery services use these metrics to estimate travel time and fuel efficiency.  

**Problem**  
A person starts at the origin of a coordinate system, where the positive $x$-axis points east and the positive $y$-axis points north. They walk 4 blocks east, 3 blocks north, and then 2 blocks west. Each block has a length of $L = 100  \text{m}$.  
- **(a)** Determine the displacement vector (in component form) from the start to the end.  
- **(b)** Calculate the magnitude of the displacement vector.  
- **(c)** Calculate the total distance traveled.  

For the final answer, provide **only the magnitude of the displacement vector** in meters. Express your answer as an exact expression.

## Solution
### Step 1: Define the displacement vectors  
Assign directional components:  
- **East**: Positive $x$-direction.  
- **West**: Negative $x$-direction.  
- **North**: Positive $y$-direction.  

The walk consists of three segments:  
1. **4 blocks east**: Displacement vector = $(4L, 0)$.  
2. **3 blocks north**: Displacement vector = $(0, 3L)$.  
3. **2 blocks west**: Displacement vector = $(-2L, 0)$.  

### Step 2: Compute the total displacement vector  
Sum the $x$-components and $y$-components separately:  

$$
x\text{-component} = 4L + 0 + (-2L) = 2L,
$$
  

$$
y\text{-component} = 0 + 3L + 0 = 3L.
$$
  
Thus, the displacement vector is $\vec{d} = (2L, 3L)$.  

### Step 3: Calculate the magnitude of the displacement vector  
The magnitude $|\vec{d}|$ is given by the Pythagorean theorem:  

$$
|\vec{d}| = \sqrt{(2L)^2 + (3L)^2} = \sqrt{4L^2 + 9L^2} = \sqrt{13L^2} = L\sqrt{13}.
$$
  
Substitute $L = 100  \text{m}$:  

$$
|\vec{d}| = 100\sqrt{13}  \text{m}.
$$
  

### Step 4: Compute the total distance traveled  
Sum the lengths of all path segments:  

$$
\text{Distance} = 4L + 3L + 2L = 9L.
$$
  
Substitute $L = 100  \text{m}$:  

$$
\text{Distance} = 900  \text{m}.
$$
  

### Final answer for displacement magnitude  
The magnitude of the displacement vector is $100\sqrt{13}$ meters.

## Answer
$$\boxed{100\sqrt{13}}$$

## Problem 4
**Background:**  
In physics, understanding motion involves distinguishing between scalar and vector quantities. Distance is a scalar that measures the total path length traveled, while displacement is a vector representing the net change in position from start to end. These concepts are foundational in kinematics and have broad applications, from navigation systems to robotics. For instance, autonomous delivery robots optimize routes by minimizing extra distance traveled beyond the direct displacement between pickup and drop-off points. This problem explores these principles in one-dimensional motion along the x-axis.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Definition of displacement (vector) and distance (scalar).  
2. Calculation of path length and net position change.  
3. Application of absolute values for magnitudes.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem reinforces vector-scalar distinctions in mechanics, directly linking to velocity (vector) and speed (scalar). It also builds a foundation for analyzing motion graphs and calculus-based kinematics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
In mathematics, absolute values and coordinate geometry are applied. In logistics, optimizing path efficiency (e.g., minimizing extra distance in delivery routes) connects to operations research.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- GPS navigation calculating shortest paths.  
- Robotics optimizing movement sequences.  
- Sports analytics tracking athletes' path efficiency.

**Problem Statement:**  
A particle moves along the x-axis starting at position $x = a$. It first moves directly to position $x = b$, then to position $x = c$. Derive an expression for the extra distance traveled by the particle, defined as the total distance traveled minus the magnitude of the displacement from start to end. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$.  

**Final Answer Format:**  
Provide a single symbolic expression using absolute values. For example, $|x|$ denotes the absolute value of $x$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Calculate total distance traveled**  
The particle moves along two segments:  
- Segment 1: From $x = a$ to $x = b$. The distance is $|b - a|$.  
- Segment 2: From $x = b$ to $x = c$. The distance is $|c - b|$.  
The total distance $d_{\text{total}}$ is the sum:  
$$ d_{\text{total}} = |b - a| + |c - b|. $$

**Step 2: Calculate displacement magnitude**  
Displacement is the net change in position from start ($x = a$) to end ($x = c$):  
$$ \text{Displacement} = c - a. $$  
The magnitude of displacement is its absolute value:  
$$ |\text{Displacement}| = |c - a|. $$

**Step 3: Derive the extra distance**  
Extra distance is defined as the total distance minus the displacement magnitude:  
$$ \text{Extra distance} = d_{\text{total}} - |\text{Displacement}| = |b - a| + |c - b| - |c - a|. $$  
This expression is non-negative by the triangle inequality and represents the additional path length beyond the direct start-to-end path.

## Answer
$$\boxed{|b - a| + |c - b| - |c - a|}$$

# displacement from velocity and time data

## Problem 0
**Background**  
In kinematics, displacement is the change in an object's position. For constant velocity, displacement is simply the product of velocity and time. However, many real-world scenarios involve motion influenced by multiple factors, such as a boat crossing a river with a current. The boat's path relative to the ground combines its velocity relative to the water and the river's current. This requires vector addition and integration of velocities over time to determine displacement.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Displacement as the integral of velocity: $\Delta x = \int v \, dt$.  
2. Vector addition of velocities in perpendicular directions.  
3. Time calculation for motion with constant velocity.  
4. Magnitude of displacement using the Pythagorean theorem.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to calculus (integration for displacement) and vector algebra (resolving perpendicular components). It extends foundational kinematics concepts to two-dimensional motion, reinforcing the link between velocity-time integration and displacement.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
River navigation models are used in fluid dynamics (engineering), route optimization (operations research), and robotics (path planning with external forces).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Ferries crossing rivers must account for currents to reach correct landing points. Similar principles apply to aircraft correcting for wind drift or autonomous vehicles adjusting for external forces.  

**Problem Statement**  
A river flows east with a constant speed $v_r$. A boat starts from the south bank and points directly north, moving at a constant speed $v_b$ relative to the water. The river has a width $W$.  
Determine the magnitude of the boat's displacement (relative to the ground) when it reaches the opposite bank.  
Express your answer in terms of $v_r$, $v_b$, and $W$.  

**Instructions for Final Answer**  
- Provide a single symbolic expression.  
- Use `\sqrt{}` for square roots and `^` for exponents (e.g., `\sqrt{v_r^2 + v_b^2}`).  
- Do not include units.

## Solution
**Step 1: Analyze motion components**  
The boat's velocity relative to the ground has two perpendicular components:  
- Northward component (due to boat's engine): $v_b$.  
- Eastward component (due to river current): $v_r$.  

**Step 2: Calculate time to cross the river**  
The time $T$ to cross the river is determined by the northward motion across width $W$ at speed $v_b$:  
$$ T = \frac{W}{v_b} $$  

**Step 3: Compute displacements**  
- **Northward displacement** (y-direction):  
  $$ y = v_b \cdot T = v_b \cdot \frac{W}{v_b} = W $$  
- **Eastward displacement** (x-direction) due to current:  
  $$ x = v_r \cdot T = v_r \cdot \frac{W}{v_b} = \frac{v_r W}{v_b} $$  

**Step 4: Find magnitude of total displacement**  
The total displacement vector is $(x, y) = \left( \frac{v_r W}{v_b}, W \right)$. Its magnitude $D$ is:  
$$ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{v_r W}{v_b} \right)^2 + W^2 } $$  
Factor out $W^2$:  
$$ D = \sqrt{ W^2 \left( \frac{v_r^2}{v_b^2} + 1 \right) } = W \sqrt{ \frac{v_r^2}{v_b^2} + 1 } $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ D = W \sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{v_r}{v_b} \right)^2} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{W \sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{v_r}{v_b} \right)^2}}$$

## Problem 1
Background: In a physics experiment, a drone is programmed to perform a test flight along a straight path. Engineers record the drone's velocity at three specific times using onboard sensors:
- At $ t = 0 $ seconds, velocity = $ 0 $ m/s
- At $ t = 1 $ second, velocity = $ -1 $ m/s
- At $ t = 3 $ seconds, velocity = $ 15 $ m/s

The engineers hypothesize that the drone's velocity follows a quadratic function of time, expressed as $ v(t) = at^2 + bt + c $, where $ v(t) $ is in m/s and $ t $ is in seconds. Displacement is defined as the net change in position from start to finish.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Modeling physical motion using a quadratic velocity function from discrete data points.
2. Solving systems of equations to determine unknown coefficients.
3. Applying definite integration to compute displacement from velocity.

Intradisciplinary Connections: This connects kinematics (motion analysis) with calculus (integration) and algebra (systems of equations). It reinforces the relationship between velocity (derivative of position) and displacement (integral of velocity).

Interdisciplinary Connections: Similar methods are used in engineering for trajectory prediction, in economics for modeling marginal changes, and in data science for curve fitting.

Real-World Applications: Calculating displacement from velocity data is essential in navigation systems (e.g., drones, autonomous vehicles), sports analytics (tracking athlete movement), and physics research (particle tracking).

The Problem:
Using the velocity data, determine the constants $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ for the quadratic function $ v(t) = at^2 + bt + c $. Then, compute the drone's displacement (in meters) between $ t = 0 $ and $ t = 3 $ seconds. 

Final Answer Format: Provide only the numerical value of the displacement in meters, rounded to the nearest whole number if necessary. Do not include units.

## Solution
**Step 1: Establish equations from velocity data**  
Given $ v(t) = at^2 + bt + c $:  
- At $ t = 0 $, $ v(0) = 0 $:  
  $$ a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 0 \implies c = 0 $$  
- At $ t = 1 $, $ v(1) = -1 $:  
  $$ a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = -1 \implies a + b = -1 \quad \text{(since } c = 0\text{)} $$  
- At $ t = 3 $, $ v(3) = 15 $:  
  $$ a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 15 \implies 9a + 3b = 15 \quad \text{(since } c = 0\text{)} $$  

**Step 2: Solve for $ a $ and $ b $**  
System of equations:  
$$  
\begin{cases}  
a + b = -1 & \text{(Equation 1)} \\  
9a + 3b = 15 & \text{(Equation 2)}  
\end{cases}  
$$  
Divide Equation 2 by 3:  
$$ 3a + b = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 2a)} $$  
Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2a:  
$$ (3a + b) - (a + b) = 5 - (-1) \implies 2a = 6 \implies a = 3 $$  
Substitute $ a = 3 $ into Equation 1:  
$$ 3 + b = -1 \implies b = -4 $$  
Thus, the velocity function is:  
$$ v(t) = 3t^2 - 4t $$  

**Step 3: Compute displacement via integration**  
Displacement $ \Delta x = \int_{0}^{3} v(t)  dt $:  
$$  
\Delta x = \int_{0}^{3} (3t^2 - 4t)  dt  
$$  
Find the antiderivative:  
$$ \int (3t^2 - 4t)  dt = t^3 - 2t^2 $$  
Evaluate from 0 to 3:  
$$  
\left[ (3)^3 - 2(3)^2 \right] - \left[ (0)^3 - 2(0)^2 \right] = (27 - 18) - 0 = 9  
$$  
The displacement is 9 meters.

## Answer
$$\boxed{9}$$

------
## Problem 2
**Background**  
In kinematics, displacement is the change in an object's position and is calculated as the integral of velocity with respect to time. When velocity data is available at discrete time intervals, numerical integration methods like the trapezoidal rule provide accurate approximations by summing the areas of trapezoids formed by consecutive velocity-time points. This approach is essential in real-world applications where continuous velocity functions are unavailable, such as analyzing sensor data from vehicles, athletes, or robots.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Interpretation of displacement as the area under a velocity-time curve.  
- Application of the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration.  
- Summation of series using discrete data points.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to calculus (integration techniques) and physics (kinematic equations). It reinforces the relationship between derivatives (acceleration as the derivative of velocity) and integrals (displacement as the integral of velocity).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The trapezoidal rule is widely used in engineering (e.g., signal processing), data science (e.g., time-series analysis), and environmental science (e.g., calculating river discharge from flow-velocity measurements).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Automotive engineers use this method to compute a vehicle's distance traveled from speedometer readings sampled at regular intervals. Similarly, sports scientists apply it to track an athlete's displacement using wearable velocity sensors.  

**Problem**  
A drone accelerates from rest along a straight path. Its velocity (in m/s) is recorded at 1-second intervals for 10 seconds:  

| Time $t$ (s) | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |  
|----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|  
| Velocity $v$ (m/s) | 0.0 | 2.5 | 4.5 | 6.0 | 7.0 | 7.5 | 7.8 | 8.0 | 8.1 | 8.2 | 8.2 |  

Using the trapezoidal rule, approximate the drone's displacement (in meters) over the 10-second interval. The trapezoidal rule for constant time step $\Delta t$ is:  
$$ s \approx \frac{\Delta t}{2} \left( v_0 + 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} v_i + v_n \right), $$  
where $n$ is the number of intervals, $\Delta t$ is the time step, and $v_i$ are the velocity measurements.  

Express your answer in meters and provide **only the numerical value** rounded to one decimal place.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify parameters**  
- Time step $\Delta t = 1$ s (given).  
- Number of intervals $n = 10$ (from $t = 0$ to $t = 10$).  
- Velocities: $v_0 = 0.0$, $v_1 = 2.5$, $v_2 = 4.5$, $v_3 = 6.0$, $v_4 = 7.0$, $v_5 = 7.5$, $v_6 = 7.8$, $v_7 = 8.0$, $v_8 = 8.1$, $v_9 = 8.2$, $v_{10} = 8.2$ m/s.  

**Step 2: Apply the trapezoidal rule formula**  
Substitute values into the formula:  
$$ s \approx \frac{1}{2} \left( v_0 + 2\sum_{i=1}^{9} v_i + v_{10} \right). $$  

**Step 3: Compute the sum of interior velocities**  
Calculate $\sum_{i=1}^{9} v_i$:  
$$ v_1 + v_2 + v_3 + v_4 + v_5 + v_6 + v_7 + v_8 + v_9 = 2.5 + 4.5 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 7.5 + 7.8 + 8.0 + 8.1 + 8.2. $$  
Add sequentially:  
- $2.5 + 4.5 = 7.0$,  
- $7.0 + 6.0 = 13.0$,  
- $13.0 + 7.0 = 20.0$,  
- $20.0 + 7.5 = 27.5$,  
- $27.5 + 7.8 = 35.3$,  
- $35.3 + 8.0 = 43.3$,  
- $43.3 + 8.1 = 51.4$,  
- $51.4 + 8.2 = 59.6$.  
Thus, $\sum_{i=1}^{9} v_i = 59.6$.  

**Step 4: Calculate the total expression inside parentheses**  
$$ v_0 + 2 \times 59.6 + v_{10} = 0.0 + 119.2 + 8.2 = 127.4. $$  

**Step 5: Multiply by $\frac{\Delta t}{2}$**  
$$ s \approx \frac{1}{2} \times 127.4 = 63.7. $$  

**Step 6: Round the result**  
The displacement is $63.7$ meters (rounded to one decimal place).

## Answer
$$\boxed{63.7}$$

## Problem 3
### Background
In kinematics, the displacement of an object moving along a straight line is the integral of its velocity with respect to time. This integral corresponds to the area under the velocity-time graph. Consider a rocket sled test on a straight track, where engineers analyze motion by examining velocity-time data. The sled starts from rest and undergoes constant acceleration followed by constant deceleration, resulting in a triangular velocity-time graph. This triangular shape arises because the velocity changes linearly during acceleration and deceleration phases.

#### Knowledge Points Tested
- Interpretation of velocity-time graphs and their relationship to displacement.
- Application of integration to compute displacement from a piecewise linear velocity function.
- Understanding that the area under a velocity-time graph represents displacement.

#### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to the equations of motion under constant acceleration, where velocity is a linear function of time. It reinforces the concept that displacement can be determined geometrically from the graph or analytically through integration, bridging graphical analysis with calculus.

#### Interdisciplinary Connections
The problem links to calculus (integration of piecewise functions) and geometry (area calculations of triangles). It also relates to data analysis in engineering, where velocity-time profiles are used to evaluate vehicle performance.

#### Real-World Applications
Rocket sled tests are used in aerospace engineering to study high-acceleration scenarios, such as pilot ejection systems or spacecraft landings. Calculating displacement from velocity-time data helps determine required track lengths and safety margins.

### Problem
A rocket sled starts from rest at time $ t = 0 $. It accelerates at a constant rate until reaching a maximum velocity $ V_{\text{max}} $ at an unknown time $ t_1 $. It then decelerates at a different constant rate until coming to rest at time $ t = T $. The velocity-time graph for this motion forms a triangle with base $ T = 6  \text{s} $ and height $ V_{\text{max}} = 12  \text{m/s} $.  

Using integration, derive an expression for the total displacement $ D $ of the sled over the interval $ [0, T] $. Show that $ D $ is independent of $ t_1 $ and express $ D $ in terms of $ T $ and $ V_{\text{max}} $.  

**Final Answer Format**:  
Express your answer symbolically in terms of $ T $ and $ V_{\text{max}} $. Use the exact fraction form if needed.

## Solution
The displacement $ D $ is the integral of the velocity function $ v(t) $ over $ [0, T] $. The motion has two phases:

1. **Acceleration phase ($ 0 \leq t \leq t_1 $)**:  
   Velocity increases linearly from $ 0 $ to $ V_{\text{max}} $:  
   
$$
   v(t) = \left( \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{t_1} \right) t
   $$


2. **Deceleration phase ($ t_1 < t \leq T $)**:  
   Velocity decreases linearly from $ V_{\text{max}} $ to $ 0 $:  
   
$$
   v(t) = V_{\text{max}} - \left( \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{T - t_1} \right) (t - t_1)
   $$


The displacement $ D $ is the sum of integrals over both phases:  

$$
D = \int_{0}^{t_1} v(t)  dt + \int_{t_1}^{T} v(t)  dt
$$


**First integral (acceleration phase)**:  

$$
\int_{0}^{t_1} \left( \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{t_1} t \right)  dt = \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{t_1} \int_{0}^{t_1} t  dt = \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{t_1} \left[ \frac{t^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{t_1} = \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{t_1} \cdot \frac{t_1^2}{2} = \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{max}} t_1
$$


**Second integral (deceleration phase)**:  
Substitute $ u = t - t_1 $, so $ du = dt $. When $ t = t_1 $, $ u = 0 $; when $ t = T $, $ u = T - t_1 $:  

$$
\int_{t_1}^{T} \left( V_{\text{max}} - \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{T - t_1} u \right)  du = \left[ V_{\text{max}} u - \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{T - t_1} \cdot \frac{u^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{T - t_1}
$$
  
Evaluating at the limits:  

$$
= \left( V_{\text{max}} (T - t_1) - \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{T - t_1} \cdot \frac{(T - t_1)^2}{2} \right) - (0) = V_{\text{max}} (T - t_1) - \frac{V_{\text{max}} (T - t_1)}{2} = \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{max}} (T - t_1)
$$


**Total displacement**:  

$$
D = \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{max}} t_1 + \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{max}} (T - t_1) = \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{max}} (t_1 + T - t_1) = \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{max}} T
$$
  

The parameter $ t_1 $ cancels out, confirming that $ D $ depends only on $ T $ and $ V_{\text{max}} $.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2} T V_{\text{max}}}$$

# drift velocity of charge carriers

## Problem 0
**Background**  
Copper is widely used in electrical wiring due to its excellent conductivity. When current flows through a copper wire, free electrons drift under the influence of an electric field, creating a net flow of charge. The drift velocity quantifies the average speed of this directed electron motion. Understanding drift velocity is essential for designing efficient circuits and predicting resistive heating in wires.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Definition of current density and its relationship to drift velocity  
- Microscopic interpretation of electric current  
- Charge carrier density in conductors  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem links Ohm's law (macroscopic) with the microscopic motion of charge carriers, bridging circuit theory and solid-state physics. It also reinforces conservation of charge in current flow.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Materials science: Charge carrier density depends on atomic properties of copper.  
Engineering: Drift velocity impacts signal propagation speed in communication cables.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Calculating power dissipation in household wiring  
- Designing high-current transmission lines to prevent overheating  
- Optimizing semiconductor devices in electronics  

**Problem Statement**  
A copper wire carries a steady current with current density $J$. The charge carrier density (free electrons per unit volume) in copper is $n$. Derive an expression for the drift velocity $v_d$ of the electrons. Use the following fundamental constants:  
- $e$: elementary charge  
- No numerical substitutions; keep all quantities symbolic.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Express $v_d$ symbolically in terms of $J$, $n$, and $e$. Use the notation $\frac{a}{b}$ for fractions and ensure exponents are written as $x^{y}$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Recall the definition of current density**  
Current density $J$ is defined as the amount of electric current $I$ per unit cross-sectional area $A$:  
$$ J = \frac{I}{A} $$  

**Step 2: Relate current to charge flow**  
Electric current $I$ equals the total charge passing through a cross-section per unit time. If $n$ is the number of charge carriers per unit volume, each with charge $e$, moving at drift velocity $v_d$ through a wire of cross-sectional area $A$:  
- Volume passing per unit time: $A v_d$  
- Charge passing per unit time: $(n e) \times (A v_d)$  
Thus:  
$$ I = n e A v_d $$  

**Step 3: Combine equations**  
Substitute the expression for $I$ from Step 2 into the current density equation from Step 1:  
$$ J = \frac{n e A v_d}{A} $$  

**Step 4: Simplify**  
The cross-sectional area $A$ cancels out:  
$$ J = n e v_d $$  

**Step 5: Solve for drift velocity**  
Rearrange to isolate $v_d$:  
$$ v_d = \frac{J}{n e} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{J}{n e}}$$

------
## Problem 1
Background:
In electrical circuits, current is carried by the movement of charge carriers (such as electrons) under an applied electric field. The drift velocity $v_d$ is the average speed at which these carriers move along the wire. The current $I$ is related to the drift velocity by the equation:
$$ I = n \cdot e \cdot A \cdot v_d $$
where:
- $n$ is the charge carrier density (number of carriers per unit volume),
- $e$ is the charge per carrier (magnitude),
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

For a cylindrical wire with diameter $d$, the cross-sectional area is circular and given by $A = \pi (d/2)^2 = \pi d^2/4$. When the diameter changes, the area changes quadratically with the diameter, while the carrier density and charge per carrier remain constant for a given material.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Relationship between current, drift velocity, and wire geometry
- Proportional reasoning for area and diameter changes
- Algebraic manipulation of the current-density equation

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects to Ohm's law and resistance ($R = \rho L / A$), as changing the wire diameter alters the cross-sectional area, which inversely affects both resistance and drift velocity for a fixed current. It also reinforces conservation principles in current flow.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Materials Science: Wire gauge selection in electrical engineering depends on understanding how geometric changes affect carrier motion.
- Fluid Dynamics: Analogous to volumetric flow rate, where fluid velocity changes when pipe diameter varies under constant flow conditions.

Real-World Applications:
- Electrical wiring standards: Thicker wires (larger diameter) reduce resistance and heat generation in high-current applications. This problem explains why such wires allow lower drift velocities for the same current, minimizing energy losses from carrier collisions.

Problem Statement:
A cylindrical wire of diameter $d$ carries a steady current $I$. The charge carrier density is $n$, and the charge per carrier is $e$. If the wire diameter is doubled to $2d$ while the current $I$, carrier density $n$, and charge $e$ remain unchanged, determine the ratio of the new drift velocity $v_d'$ to the original drift velocity $v_d$.

Express your answer as a simplified fraction.

## Solution
The current $I$ is given by:
$$ I = n \cdot e \cdot A \cdot v_d $$
where $A$ is the cross-sectional area. For the original wire with diameter $d$:
$$ A = \pi \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} $$
After doubling the diameter to $2d$, the new area $A'$ is:
$$ A' = \pi \left( \frac{2d}{2} \right)^2 = \pi d^2 $$
Since $\pi d^2 = 4 \cdot (\pi d^2 / 4)$, we have:
$$ A' = 4A $$
The current remains constant at $I$, and $n$, $e$ are unchanged. Thus, for the new wire:
$$ I = n \cdot e \cdot A' \cdot v_d' = n \cdot e \cdot (4A) \cdot v_d' $$
Equate this to the original current expression:
$$ n \cdot e \cdot A \cdot v_d = n \cdot e \cdot 4A \cdot v_d' $$
Divide both sides by $n \cdot e \cdot A$ (non-zero):
$$ v_d = 4 v_d' $$
Solve for the ratio:
$$ \frac{v_d'}{v_d} = \frac{1}{4} $$
Thus, the drift velocity reduces to one-fourth of its original value.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}$$

------
## Problem 2
**Background**  
Semiconductors like germanium are essential in modern electronics, such as transistors and diodes. In these materials, charge carriers (electrons and holes) move under an electric field, leading to electrical conduction. The drift velocity is the average speed at which holes (positively charged carriers) move due to an applied electric field. At low fields, drift velocity $v_d$ is proportional to the electric field $E$ via mobility $\mu_0$ (i.e., $v_d = \mu_0 E$). However, at high fields, scattering effects cause velocity saturation, modeled by:  
$$ v_d = \frac{\mu_0 E}{\left[1 + \left(\frac{\mu_0 E}{v_{\text{sat}}}\right)^\beta\right]^{1/\beta}} $$  
where $v_{\text{sat}}$ is the saturation velocity and $\beta$ is a material-specific exponent. For holes in germanium, $\beta = 2$.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Drift velocity and carrier mobility in semiconductors.  
2. Modeling non-linear velocity saturation at high electric fields.  
3. Algebraic manipulation of transcendental equations.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This connects to Ohm's law (for low fields) and carrier dynamics in condensed matter physics. It also extends to semiconductor device physics, where high-field transport dictates device speed and efficiency.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Relates to electrical engineering (transistor design) and materials science (semiconductor properties). The saturation model resembles friction models in mechanics (e.g., terminal velocity).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Predicts performance limits in high-speed germanium devices (e.g., photodetectors) and aids in designing nanoscale transistors where electric fields are intense.  

**Problem Statement**  
A germanium semiconductor has hole mobility $\mu_0$ and saturation velocity $v_{\text{sat}}$. Under an electric field $E$, the drift velocity of holes follows:  
$$ v_d = \frac{\mu_0 E}{\left[1 + \left(\frac{\mu_0 E}{v_{\text{sat}}}\right)^2\right]^{1/2}} $$  
Find the drift velocity $v_d$ when the electric field is set to $E_0 = \dfrac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\mu_0}$.  
Express your answer symbolically in terms of $v_{\text{sat}}$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Substitute the given electric field**  
The electric field is $E_0 = \dfrac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\mu_0}$. Substitute this into the drift velocity equation:  
$$ v_d = \frac{\mu_0 \cdot E_0}{\left[1 + \left(\frac{\mu_0 \cdot E_0}{v_{\text{sat}}}\right)^2\right]^{1/2}} = \frac{\mu_0 \cdot \dfrac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\mu_0}}{\left[1 + \left(\frac{\mu_0 \cdot \dfrac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\mu_0}}{v_{\text{sat}}}\right)^2\right]^{1/2}} $$  

**Step 2: Simplify the numerator and the expression inside the parentheses**  
Numerator: $\mu_0 \cdot \dfrac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\mu_0} = v_{\text{sat}}$.  
Inside the parentheses:  
$$ \frac{\mu_0 \cdot \dfrac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\mu_0}}{v_{\text{sat}}} = \frac{v_{\text{sat}}}{v_{\text{sat}}} = 1 $$  
Thus, the equation becomes:  
$$ v_d = \frac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\left[1 + \left(1\right)^2\right]^{1/2}} = \frac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\left[1 + 1\right]^{1/2}} $$  

**Step 3: Simplify the denominator**  
$[1 + 1]^{1/2} = [2]^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}$.  
Therefore:  
$$ v_d = \frac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\sqrt{2}} $$  

The drift velocity is $\dfrac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\sqrt{2}}$ when $E_0 = \dfrac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\mu_0}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{v_{\text{sat}}}{\sqrt{2}}}$$

## Problem 3
**Background**:  
Silver is a highly conductive metal commonly used in electrical wiring. When a current flows through a silver wire, free electrons (charge carriers) drift slowly along the wire due to the applied electric field. The drift velocity $v_d$ is the average velocity of these electrons in the direction of the current. This velocity is much smaller than the electrons' random thermal motion but is responsible for net charge transport. The relationship between current and drift velocity is fundamental to understanding electrical conduction in solids.

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. The microscopic model of electric current: $I = nAev_d$, where $n$ is the free electron density, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $v_d$ is the drift velocity.  
2. Kinematics of uniform motion: time $t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{velocity}}$.  
3. Symbolic manipulation to derive an expression for time $t$ in terms of given parameters.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem connects the macroscopic concept of current (from circuit theory) to the microscopic motion of charge carriers (solid-state physics). It reinforces how material properties (e.g., free electron density $n$) influence electrical behavior.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
The derivation parallels fluid dynamics, where flow rate relates to fluid velocity and pipe cross-section. It also illustrates how particle drift in electric fields applies to semiconductor devices (electronics engineering) and plasma physics.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
Understanding drift velocity explains signal propagation delays in wires, efficiency of electrical conductors, and design limitations in high-speed electronics. For example, slow drift velocities (e.g., millimeters per second) contrast with near-instantaneous current establishment due to electromagnetic field propagation.  

**Problem Statement**:  
A silver wire with cross-sectional area $A$ carries a steady current $I$. The free electron density in silver is $n$, and the elementary charge is $e$. Derive an expression for the time $t$ an electron takes to drift a distance $d = 1 \text{ m}$ along the wire. Express $t$ symbolically in terms of the given quantities $I$, $A$, $n$, $e$, and $d$.  

**Required Format for the Final Answer**:  
Provide a symbolic expression for $t$ using the variables $I$, $A$, $n$, $e$, and $d$. Do not substitute numerical values. Enclose your final answer in \boxed{}.

## Solution
**Step 1: Relate current to drift velocity**  
The current $I$ is given by the formula:  
$$ I = nAev_d $$  
where:  
- $n$ = free electron density,  
- $A$ = cross-sectional area of the wire,  
- $e$ = elementary charge,  
- $v_d$ = drift velocity of electrons.  

**Step 2: Solve for drift velocity $v_d$**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $v_d$:  
$$ v_d = \frac{I}{nAe} $$  

**Step 3: Express time $t$ for distance $d$**  
The time $t$ for an electron to travel distance $d$ at constant drift velocity $v_d$ is:  
$$ t = \frac{d}{v_d} $$  

**Step 4: Substitute $v_d$ into the time equation**  
Replace $v_d$ with the expression from Step 2:  
$$ t = \frac{d}{\frac{I}{nAe}} $$  

**Step 5: Simplify the expression**  
Simplify the complex fraction:  
$$ t = d \cdot \frac{nAe}{I} = \frac{d \cdot n \cdot A \cdot e}{I} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The time $t$ for an electron to drift a distance $d$ is:  
$$ t = \frac{d n A e}{I} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{d n A e}{I}}$$

------
## Problem 4
**Background**

In conductors like copper wires, free electrons move randomly due to thermal energy. When an electric field is applied, these electrons experience a force that superimposes a slow, net directional motion called *drift velocity* on their random thermal motion. This drift velocity is central to understanding electric current in circuits. The Drude model (proposed by Paul Drude in 1900) simplifies this behavior by treating electrons as particles that accelerate freely between instantaneous collisions with lattice ions. After each collision, the electron's directional velocity resets to zero, while its random thermal component remains. The average time between collisions is the *mean free time* (τ).

**Knowledge Points Tested**
- Force and acceleration of charge carriers in an electric field.
- Definition of drift velocity and its relationship to current.
- Averaging motion over collision intervals in the Drude model.
- Linear proportionality between drift velocity and electric field.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
- Connects to Ohm’s law (macroscopic) and current density (microscopic).
- Relates to kinetic theory (mean free path, collision dynamics).
- Extends to resistivity (ρ) and conductivity (σ = 1/ρ) in materials.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
- Materials science: Role of defects/temperature in mean free time (τ).
- Engineering: Designing conductors for minimal energy loss in circuits.
- Chemistry: Charge carrier density (n) in different materials (e.g., copper vs. silicon).

**Real-World Applications**
- Calculating power dissipation (P = I²R) in electrical wiring.
- Optimizing semiconductor devices (e.g., transistors) by tuning carrier mobility.
- Analyzing battery performance in electric vehicles (current vs. voltage trade-offs).

**Problem**

Consider a straight cylindrical conductor of length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$ carrying a steady current. A uniform electric field $\vec{E}$ (magnitude $E$) is maintained along its length. Each free electron has charge $-e$ ($e > 0$) and mass $m$. The conductor has $n$ free electrons per unit volume.  
In the Drude model:  
1. Electrons accelerate freely between collisions with lattice ions.  
2. Immediately after a collision, an electron’s velocity component parallel to $\vec{E}$ is zero (on average).  
3. The average time between collisions is $\tau$ (mean free time).  

**Derive** the relationship between the magnitude of the drift velocity $v_d$ and the electric field strength $E$. Express $v_d$ explicitly in terms of $e$, $m$, $\tau$, and $E$.  

**Required Format for Final Answer**  
Provide the equation $v_d = \text{expression}$ using the variables $e$, $m$, $\tau$, and $E$. Do not include units or numerical values. Use the notation $v_d$ for drift velocity and $E$ for electric field strength.

## Solution
**Step 1: Force and acceleration of an electron**  
The electric field $\vec{E}$ exerts a force $\vec{F} = -e \vec{E}$ on an electron. Since $\vec{E}$ is uniform and directed along the conductor, the force magnitude is $F = eE$. The resulting acceleration $a$ (magnitude) along the field direction is given by Newton’s second law:  
$$ a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{eE}{m}. $$  

**Step 2: Velocity between collisions**  
After a collision, the electron’s velocity parallel to $\vec{E}$ is reset to zero. It then accelerates uniformly until the next collision. At time $t$ after a collision, its velocity component parallel to $\vec{E}$ is:  
$$ v(t) = a t = \frac{eE}{m} t. $$  

**Step 3: Average drift velocity over collision intervals**  
The average drift velocity $v_d$ is the mean of $v(t)$ over many collision intervals. Since collisions occur randomly, the distribution of free times $t$ has a mean value $\tau$. The average of $v(t)$ is:  
$$ v_d = \langle v(t) \rangle = \left\langle \frac{eE}{m} t \right\rangle. $$  
Because $e$, $E$, and $m$ are constants:  
$$ v_d = \frac{eE}{m} \langle t \rangle. $$  
The mean free time $\tau$ is defined as $\langle t \rangle = \tau$, so:  
$$ v_d = \frac{eE}{m} \tau. $$  

**Step 4: Directional note**  
The negative charge of electrons means the drift velocity $\vec{v}_d$ is antiparallel to $\vec{E}$. However, the magnitude $v_d$ is the quantity of interest here.  

**Conclusion**  
The drift velocity $v_d$ is linearly proportional to the electric field strength $E$, with the proportionality constant $\frac{e \tau}{m}$:  
$$ v_d = \frac{e \tau}{m} E. $$  
This relationship is fundamental to Ohm’s law in microscopic form ($J = \sigma E$, where current density $J = n e v_d$ and conductivity $\sigma = \frac{n e^2 \tau}{m}$).

## Answer
$$\boxed{v_d = \dfrac{e \tau E}{m}}$$

# electric current and conventional direction

## Problem 0
**Background**

Electric current is the flow of electric charge, fundamental to understanding circuits and electrical systems. In metallic wires, charge carriers are electrons, which are negatively charged. Historically, "conventional current" was defined as the direction of positive charge flow—a convention established before the discovery of electrons. This concept remains critical for analyzing circuits, as schematic symbols and component behaviors (e.g., diodes) rely on this directional definition. When electrons move, conventional current flows opposite to their direction, but its magnitude depends on the rate of charge transfer.

**Knowledge Points Tested**
1. Definition of electric current: $I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$ (charge flow rate).
2. Charge of an electron: $-e$ (where $e$ is the elementary charge, a positive constant).
3. Conventional current: Direction and magnitude based on equivalent positive charge flow, opposite to electron movement.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
- Connects to Ohm's law ($V = IR$), where $I$ is conventional current.
- Essential for Kirchhoff's laws in circuit analysis, which depend on consistent current direction.
- Relates to drift velocity and current density in conductors ($J = I/A$).

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
- **Chemistry**: Electrolysis and ion movement involve charge carriers with different signs (e.g., $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$).
- **Technology**: Semiconductor devices (e.g., transistors) use conventional current in design schematics.
- **Biology**: Neural signal transmission involves ion currents, where directionality affects signal propagation.

**Real-World Applications**
- Household wiring: Safety standards (e.g., fuses) depend on current magnitude and direction.
- Electronics manufacturing: Circuit board design follows conventional current flow.
- Medical devices: Pacemakers regulate heartbeats using controlled current pulses.

**Problem Statement**

A copper wire carries a steady flow of electrons. Over a time interval of $t$ seconds, exactly $n$ electrons pass a fixed point in the wire. Determine the conventional current, $I$, in the wire. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $n$, $t$, and $e$ (the elementary charge).

## Solution
**Step 1: Calculate total charge transferred**  
Each electron carries charge $-e$. The total charge $Q$ transferred by $n$ electrons is:  
$$ Q = n \cdot (-e) = -n e $$  

**Step 2: Define electric current**  
Electric current is the rate of charge flow. The instantaneous current in the direction of electron motion is:  
$$ I_{\text{electron}} = \frac{dQ}{dt} $$  
For steady flow, this simplifies to the average current:  
$$ I_{\text{electron}} = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{-n e}{t} $$  
The negative sign indicates charge flow opposite to the conventional direction.  

**Step 3: Relate to conventional current**  
Conventional current $I$ is defined as the flow of positive charge. Thus, it is the negative of $I_{\text{electron}}$:  
$$ I = -I_{\text{electron}} = - \left( \frac{-n e}{t} \right) $$  
Simplifying:  
$$ I = \frac{n e}{t} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The magnitude $\frac{n e}{t}$ represents the conventional current, as it equals the rate of equivalent positive charge flow.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{n e}{t}}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
In electrical circuits, current arises from the net movement of charge carriers. For a copper wire, free electrons act as these carriers. When a current flows, electrons drift slowly through the wire despite electricity propagating nearly at light speed. This drift velocity depends on the wire's dimensions, current magnitude, and material properties of copper.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Definition of electric current as charge flow per unit time  
- Relationship between drift velocity, charge carrier density, and current  
- Connection between macroscopic material properties (density, molar mass) and microscopic charge carrier density  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem links atomic-scale electron motion to macroscopic current measurements, bridging concepts from electrostatics, material science, and charge conservation.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Calculating charge carrier density requires chemistry concepts: Avogadro's constant relates molar mass to atomic count, and material density provides mass-volume relationships.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Understanding drift velocity explains why high-current wires heat up (slow-moving electrons collide more with atoms) and informs designs for efficient power transmission in grids and microelectronics.  

**Problem**  
A copper wire with diameter $d$ carries a steady current $I$. Copper has one free electron per atom. The mass density of copper is $\rho_m$, its molar mass is $M$, and Avogadro's constant is $N_A$. The elementary charge is $e$. Derive an expression for the drift velocity $v_d$ of the electrons.  
Express $v_d$ exclusively in terms of $I$, $d$, $\rho_m$, $M$, $N_A$, and $e$.  
Format your final answer as a single simplified fraction.

## Solution
**Step 1: Relate current to drift velocity**  
Electric current $I$ is defined as the charge passing through a cross-section per unit time. For electrons with drift velocity $v_d$:  
$$ I = n \cdot e \cdot A \cdot v_d $$  
where:  
- $n$ = number of free electrons per unit volume,  
- $e$ = elementary charge,  
- $A$ = cross-sectional area of the wire.  

**Step 2: Express cross-sectional area**  
The wire has diameter $d$, so:  
$$ A = \pi \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} $$  

**Step 3: Determine electron density $n$**  
Copper has one free electron per atom, so $n$ equals the number of copper atoms per unit volume.  
- Mass per unit volume = $\rho_m$,  
- Molar mass = $M$ (mass per mole),  
- Atoms per mole = $N_A$ (Avogadro's constant).  
Thus, atoms per unit volume is:  
$$ n = \frac{\rho_m}{M} \cdot N_A $$  

**Step 4: Combine equations**  
Substitute $n$ and $A$ into the current equation:  
$$ I = \left( \frac{\rho_m N_A}{M} \right) \cdot e \cdot \left( \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \right) \cdot v_d $$  

**Step 5: Solve for drift velocity $v_d$**  
Rearrange to isolate $v_d$:  
$$ v_d = \frac{I}{\left( \frac{\rho_m N_A}{M} \right) \cdot e \cdot \frac{\pi d^2}{4}} = \frac{I \cdot M}{\rho_m N_A e \cdot \frac{\pi d^2}{4}} $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ v_d = \frac{I \cdot M \cdot 4}{\rho_m N_A e \pi d^2} = \frac{4 I M}{\pi \rho_m N_A e d^2} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{4IM}{\pi \rho_{m} N_{A} e d^{2}}}$$

## Problem 2
**Background**  
Electric current is defined as the rate at which charge flows through a cross-sectional area of a conductor. While conventional current assumes the flow of positive charges, in most solid conductors (like metals), current is actually carried by negatively charged electrons moving in the opposite direction. Understanding this distinction is crucial for analyzing circuits with multiple charge carriers, such as electrolytes or semiconductors, where both positive and negative carriers contribute to net current.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Definition of conventional current ($I = \Delta Q / \Delta t$)  
- Directionality of charge carrier movement (positive vs. negative carriers)  
- Net charge flow through a cross-section  
- Vector superposition of contributions from different carriers  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
Relates to Ohm’s law (microscopic form $J = \sigma E$), charge conservation, and drift velocity in conductors.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**

**Problem**  
A conductor with cross-sectional area $A$ contains two types of mobile charge carriers:  
- Positive carriers: charge $+q$, number density $n_+$ (carriers per unit volume), drifting with velocity $v_+$ in the direction of conventional current.  
- Negative carriers: charge $-q$, number density $n_-$ (carriers per unit volume), drifting with velocity $v_-$ opposite to the conventional current direction ($v_- > 0$).  

Derive an expression for the conventional current $I$ in terms of $A$, $q$, $n_+$, $n_-$, $v_+$, and $v_-$.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Express your answer as a symbolic expression using $A$, $q$, $n_+$, $n_-$, $v_+$, and $v_-$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Current due to positive carriers**  
The conventional current $I_+$ from positive carriers is the charge passing through a cross-section per unit time. In time $\Delta t$, positive carriers move a distance $v_+ \Delta t$. The volume swept through the cross-section is $A \cdot v_+ \Delta t$. The number of positive carriers in this volume is $n_+ A v_+ \Delta t$, and their total charge is:  
$$\Delta Q_+ = (n_+ A v_+ \Delta t) \cdot q.$$  
Thus, the current contribution is:  
$$I_+ = \frac{\Delta Q_+}{\Delta t} = n_+ q A v_+.$$  

**Step 2: Current due to negative carriers**  
Negative carriers drift opposite to conventional current (velocity $-v_-$). In time $\Delta t$, they move a distance $-v_- \Delta t$ (i.e., leftward if conventional current is rightward). The charge passing rightward through the cross-section is equivalent to *positive charge moving leftward*. For negative carriers:  
- Number passing through cross-section in $\Delta t$: $n_- \cdot A \cdot v_- \Delta t$ (since $v_-$ is speed).  
- Charge carried: $\Delta Q_- = (n_- A v_- \Delta t) \cdot (-q) = -n_- q A v_- \Delta t$.  
The *conventional current* $I_-$ is the rate of *effective positive charge* flow. Moving negative charge $-|\Delta Q|$ leftward is equivalent to moving positive charge $+|\Delta Q|$ rightward:  
$$I_- = \frac{\text{effective positive charge}}{\Delta t} = \frac{|n_- q A v_- \Delta t|}{\Delta t} = n_- q A v_-.$$  

**Step 3: Total conventional current**  
The net conventional current $I$ is the sum of both contributions:  
$$I = I_+ + I_- = n_+ q A v_+ + n_- q A v_-.$$  
Factor out common terms:  
$$I = q A (n_+ v_+ + n_- v_-).$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{qA\left(n_{+}v_{+} + n_{-}v_{-}\right)}$$

## Problem 3
Background:
In electrical circuits, resistors can be connected in various configurations to control current flow. Parallel connections are commonly used in household wiring, automotive lighting systems, and electronic devices to provide independent current paths. When multiple resistors are connected in parallel to a voltage source, the total resistance of the combination is less than any individual resistance. This occurs because parallel connections provide additional pathways for charge carriers to flow, effectively increasing the overall conductance of the circuit.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Ohm's law: $V = IR$  
2. Kirchhoff's current law (conservation of charge at junctions)  
3. Definition of equivalent resistance ($R_{eq}$) for a parallel circuit  
4. Algebraic manipulation of fractions and rational expressions  

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects to series resistor combinations (contrasting additive vs. reciprocal behavior), power dissipation in circuits ($P = V^2/R$), and the general principle that conductance (G = 1/R) is additive in parallel circuits.  

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Physics: Conservation laws (charge/energy)  
- Mathematics: Harmonic means and reciprocal identities  
- Engineering: Circuit design for current division in sensors and power distribution systems  

Real-World Applications:
- Designing shunt resistors in ammeters to measure high currents  
- Calculating total resistance in home electrical systems with parallel appliances  
- Optimizing battery life in portable devices by managing equivalent load resistance  

Problem Statement:
Three resistors with resistances $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$ are connected in parallel to an ideal battery with voltage $V$. Using fundamental principles of circuit theory, derive the equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$ of the entire combination. Express $R_{eq}$ exclusively in terms of $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$ as a single rational expression.  

Format Requirements:  
- Express the final answer as a single fraction using \frac{}{} notation.  
- Use $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$ as variables; do not substitute numerical values.  
- Simplify the expression completely.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply Kirchhoff's current law**  
The total current $I$ supplied by the battery splits into three branch currents $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$:  
$$ I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 $$  

**Step 2: Apply Ohm's law to each resistor**  
The voltage across each resistor equals the battery voltage $V$ since they are in parallel:  
$$ I_1 = \frac{V}{R_1}, \quad I_2 = \frac{V}{R_2}, \quad I_3 = \frac{V}{R_3} $$  

**Step 3: Substitute into current equation**  
Combine the expressions from Step 2:  
$$ I = \frac{V}{R_1} + \frac{V}{R_2} + \frac{V}{R_3} $$  
Factor out $V$:  
$$ I = V \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} \right) $$  

**Step 4: Define equivalent resistance**  
The equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$ satisfies Ohm's law for the entire circuit:  
$$ V = I R_{eq} \quad \Rightarrow \quad I = \frac{V}{R_{eq}} $$  

**Step 5: Equate current expressions**  
Set the expressions for $I$ from Steps 3 and 4 equal:  
$$ \frac{V}{R_{eq}} = V \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} \right) $$  

**Step 6: Solve for $R_{eq}$**  
Divide both sides by $V$ (assuming $V \neq 0$):  
$$ \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} $$  
Combine the right-hand side over a common denominator $R_1 R_2 R_3$:  
$$ \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{R_2 R_3 + R_1 R_3 + R_1 R_2}{R_1 R_2 R_3} $$  
Take the reciprocal of both sides:  
$$ R_{eq} = \frac{R_1 R_2 R_3}{R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3} $$  
The expression is fully simplified as a single rational expression in terms of $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{R_1 R_2 R_3}{R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3}}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**

In electrical circuits, Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all voltages around a closed loop equals zero, reflecting energy conservation. A real voltage source (e.g., a battery) has an internal resistance $R_i$, which causes a voltage drop when current flows. This is crucial in practical applications like battery-powered devices (e.g., flashlights or sensors), where internal resistance affects performance, especially under load.  

This problem involves a series circuit with a voltage source (emf $V$, internal resistance $R_i$) and three resistors: $R$ (the focus), $R_1$, and $R_2$. The conventional direction of current—defined as the flow of positive charge from the battery’s positive terminal—is assumed.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL)  
- Ohm’s law ($V = IR$)  
- Series circuit analysis (current conservation)  
- Voltage source modeling (emf and internal resistance)  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
- Relates to power dissipation ($P = I^2R$) and energy efficiency in circuits.  
- Extends to RC circuits (with capacitors) for timing applications.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Engineering**: Circuit design for battery efficiency in portable devices.  
- **Mathematics**: Solving linear equations derived from KVL.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Predicting current in battery-operated devices (e.g., calculating battery life in a flashlight).  
- Designing sensor circuits where precise current control prevents component damage.  

**Problem**  
A battery with emf $V$ and internal resistance $R_i$ is connected in series with three resistors: $R$, $R_1$, and $R_2$. The circuit forms a single closed loop: the battery’s positive terminal connects to $R$, then to $R_1$, then to $R_2$, and back to the battery’s negative terminal. Derive an expression for the current $I$ flowing through resistor $R$.  

Express $I$ in terms of $V$, $R$, $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_i$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)**  
Traverse the loop clockwise starting from the battery’s negative terminal. The voltage changes are:  
- Voltage rise across the battery: $+V$ (emf).  
- Voltage drop across internal resistance $R_i$: $-I R_i$ (Ohm’s law).  
- Voltage drop across $R_2$: $-I R_2$.  
- Voltage drop across $R_1$: $-I R_1$.  
- Voltage drop across $R$: $-I R$.  
Summing these gives:  
$$ V - I R_i - I R_2 - I R_1 - I R = 0 $$  

**Step 2: Solve for Current $I$**  
Rearrange the equation:  
$$ V = I R_i + I R_2 + I R_1 + I R $$  
Factor out $I$:  
$$ V = I (R_i + R_2 + R_1 + R) $$  
Solve for $I$:  
$$ I = \frac{V}{R_i + R + R_1 + R_2} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The current through resistor $R$ is $\frac{V}{R_i + R + R_1 + R_2}$. Since the circuit is series, this current is identical everywhere in the loop.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{V}{R_i + R + R_1 + R_2}}$$

## Problem 5
**Background**  
In metallic conductors, electric current arises from the movement of free electrons. The conventional current direction, established before the discovery of electrons, is defined as the flow of *positive* charges. However, in metals, electrons (with negative charge $-e$) are the charge carriers, moving *opposite* to the conventional current direction. When a conventional current $I$ flows through a resistor, energy is dissipated as heat due to collisions between electrons and the atomic lattice.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Relationship between conventional current and electron drift velocity.  
2. Microscopic model of power dissipation via work done by the electric field.  
3. Definition and application of electron mobility ($\mu$).  
4. Algebraic derivation linking macroscopic current to microscopic parameters.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects Ohm’s law ($V = IR$) to the microscopic form (current density $\vec{J} = \sigma \vec{E}$), and relates power dissipation ($P = I^2 R$) to the kinetic energy transfer in electron-lattice collisions.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The electron mobility ($\mu$) concept bridges physics with materials science, where $\mu$ depends on crystal structure and temperature. Applications include semiconductor design (e.g., transistors) and energy-efficient conductor materials.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Understanding microscopic power dissipation is crucial for:  
- Reducing energy loss in power grids.  
- Designing heat sinks in electronics.  
- Developing high-mobility materials for faster processors.  

---

**Problem Statement**  
A resistor of length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$ carries a conventional current $I$. The resistor material has $n$ free electrons per unit volume, each with charge $-e$ ($e > 0$). The electron mobility is $\mu$ (defined as $v_d = \mu E$, where $v_d$ is the drift speed and $E$ is the electric field magnitude).  

Derive an expression for the power $P$ dissipated in the resistor, **starting from the work done by the electric field on individual electrons**. Express $P$ in terms of $I$, $L$, $A$, $n$, $e$, and $\mu$.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Provide a simplified expression. Use the variables $I$, $L$, $A$, $n$, $e$, $\mu$ exactly as defined.

## Solution
**Step 1: Relate conventional current $I$ to electron drift velocity $v_d$**  
The magnitude of conventional current $I$ equals the charge passing through a cross-section per unit time. Since electrons (charge $-e$) drift with speed $v_d$ opposite to $I$:  
$$ I = (\text{charge per electron}) \times (\text{number of electrons passing per unit time}). $$  
Number of electrons passing per unit time $= n \cdot (A v_d)$ (electrons per unit volume $\times$ volume swept per unit time). Thus,  
$$ I = e \cdot (n A v_d) \implies v_d = \frac{I}{n e A}. \quad (1) $$  

**Step 2: Express drift velocity $v_d$ using mobility $\mu$**  
By definition of mobility:  
$$ v_d = \mu E \implies E = \frac{v_d}{\mu}. \quad (2) $$  
Substitute (1) into (2):  
$$ E = \frac{I}{n e A \mu}. \quad (3) $$  

**Step 3: Calculate power delivered to one electron**  
The electric force on one electron is $\vec{F} = (-e) \vec{E}$. The electron’s velocity $\vec{v}_d$ is opposite to $\vec{E}$, so $\vec{v}_d = -v_d \hat{E}$ (where $\hat{E}$ is the unit vector in the $\vec{E}$-direction). The power delivered to one electron is:  
$$ P_{\text{one}} = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{v}_d = [(-e) E \hat{E}] \cdot [-v_d \hat{E}] = e E v_d (\hat{E} \cdot \hat{E}) = e E v_d. \quad (4) $$  

**Step 4: Compute total power dissipated**  
The total number of electrons in the resistor is $n \times (\text{volume}) = n A L$. Assuming all work done by the field is dissipated as heat via collisions, the total power $P$ is:  
$$ P = (\text{number of electrons}) \times P_{\text{one}} = (n A L) \cdot (e E v_d). \quad (5) $$  
Substitute (1) and (3) into (5):  
$$ P = n A L \cdot e \cdot \left( \frac{I}{n e A \mu} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{I}{n e A} \right). $$  

**Step 5: Simplify the expression**  
Cancel terms step by step:  
$$ P = n A L e \cdot \frac{I}{n e A \mu} \cdot \frac{I}{n e A} = L \cdot \frac{I}{\mu} \cdot \frac{I}{n e A} = \frac{L I^2}{\mu n e A}. $$  
Thus, the power dissipated is:  
$$ P = \frac{L I^{2}}{\mu  n  e  A}. $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{L I^{2}}{\mu  n  e  A}}$$

# electromagnetic spectrum properties

## Problem 0
Background:
Electromagnetic waves, including radio waves, travel at the speed of light $c$ in vacuum. The relationship between the frequency $f$ and wavelength $\lambda$ of any electromagnetic wave is given by the fundamental equation:

$$ c = f \lambda $$

This equation arises from the wave nature of electromagnetic radiation, where the speed of propagation equals the product of frequency and wavelength. In experimental settings, the wavelength of radio waves can be determined using interference patterns. For a standing wave formed by a radio transmitter and receiver, the distance between consecutive nodes (points of minimum intensity) is exactly half the wavelength. This occurs because a node-to-node distance corresponds to half a full cycle of the wave.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Relationship between frequency, wavelength, and wave speed for electromagnetic waves.
2. Interpretation of standing wave patterns and node separation.
3. Algebraic manipulation of the wave equation to derive frequency.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects wave mechanics (standing waves and node separation) to electromagnetic theory (propagation of radio waves). It reinforces the universality of wave properties across different contexts within physics, such as sound and light waves.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The experimental method used relates to electrical engineering (antenna design and radio frequency measurement) and data analysis (interpreting intensity patterns from receiver measurements).

Real-World Applications:
Determining radio wave frequencies is essential for telecommunications, including broadcasting, radar systems, and wireless networks. For example, knowing the exact frequency helps avoid signal interference between devices and optimizes antenna lengths in transmission systems.

Problem:
In an experiment to measure the properties of a radio wave, a receiver is moved along a straight line away from a transmitter. The distance between two consecutive intensity minima (nodes) is measured as $d = 1.25  \text{m}$. Derive an expression for the frequency $f$ of the radio wave in terms of the speed of light $c$ and the measured distance $d$. 

Express your answer as a simplified fraction. Use the symbols $c$ and $d$ in your expression. Do not substitute any numerical values.

## Solution
**Step 1: Relate the measured distance to wavelength**  
In a standing wave pattern, the distance between two consecutive nodes is half the wavelength. Given the measured distance $d$:  
$$ d = \frac{\lambda}{2} $$  
Solving for the wavelength $\lambda$:  
$$ \lambda = 2d $$  

**Step 2: Apply the wave equation for electromagnetic waves**  
The fundamental relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength is:  
$$ c = f \lambda $$  
Substitute the expression for $\lambda$ from Step 1:  
$$ c = f \cdot (2d) $$  

**Step 3: Solve for the frequency $f$**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $f$:  
$$ f = \frac{c}{2d} $$  
This is the expression for the frequency in terms of $c$ and $d$.  

**Conclusion**  
The frequency $f$ is derived as $f = \frac{c}{2d}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $d$ is the measured distance between consecutive nodes.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{c}{2d}}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
In quantum mechanics, light is composed of photons, each carrying discrete amounts of energy. The energy of a photon is directly related to its frequency and inversely related to its wavelength via fundamental constants. This relationship is crucial in understanding phenomena like the photoelectric effect, spectroscopy, and optical communications. When working with atomic-scale energies, the electronvolt (eV) is a convenient unit, defined as the kinetic energy gained by an electron accelerated through a potential difference of 1 volt.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Photon energy-wavelength relationship: Deriving $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$ from fundamental principles.
2. Unit conversions: Translating between meters (m) and nanometers (nm), and between joules (J) and electronvolts (eV).
3. Dimensional analysis: Ensuring consistent units throughout the derivation.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem bridges concepts from quantum mechanics (photon energy quantization) and electromagnetism (wave propagation). It reinforces the dual wave-particle nature of light and connects to atomic physics through the eV unit.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The eV unit is essential in chemistry (molecular orbital energies) and materials science (band gaps in semiconductors). The calculation also applies to engineering contexts like photovoltaic cell design.

Real-World Applications:
- Determining photon energies in visible light for LED technology.
- Calculating threshold wavelengths for photoelectric sensors.
- Analyzing spectral lines in astronomical observations.

Problem:
Derive an expression for the energy $E$ (in eV) of a photon in terms of its wavelength $\lambda$ (in nm). Use this expression to calculate the energy for a photon with $\lambda = 650 \ \text{nm}$.  

Given constants:  
- Planck's constant $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \ \text{J} \cdot \text{s}$  
- Speed of light $c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \ \text{m/s}$  
- Elementary charge $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \ \text{C}$ (to define 1 eV)  
- $1 \ \text{nm} = 10^{-9} \ \text{m}$  

Express the final numerical answer in eV with six significant digits. Provide only the numerical value in the boxed answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Derive the photon energy formula**  
The energy of a photon is given by:  

$$ E = hf $$
  
where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency.  
The speed of light relates frequency and wavelength:  

$$ c = f\lambda $$
  
Rearranging for frequency:  

$$ f = \frac{c}{\lambda} $$
  
Substitute into the energy equation:  

$$ E = h \cdot \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$
  
This gives energy in joules (J) when $\lambda$ is in meters (m).  

**Step 2: Convert wavelength to meters**  
Given $\lambda = 650 \ \text{nm}$, convert to meters:  

$$ \lambda = 650 \times 10^{-9} \ \text{m} = 6.50 \times 10^{-7} \ \text{m} $$
  

**Step 3: Calculate energy in joules**  
Substitute constants and wavelength into the energy formula:  

$$ E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (2.998 \times 10^8)}{6.50 \times 10^{-7}} \ \text{J} $$
  
Compute the numerator:  

$$ hc = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (2.998 \times 10^8) = 1.986 \times 10^{-25} \ \text{J} \cdot \text{m} $$
  
Divide by wavelength:  

$$ E = \frac{1.986 \times 10^{-25}}{6.50 \times 10^{-7}} = 3.055 \times 10^{-19} \ \text{J} $$
  

**Step 4: Convert joules to electronvolts**  
1 eV is defined as the energy equal to $e \times 1 \ \text{V} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \ \text{J}$. Thus:  

$$ E_{\text{eV}} = \frac{E_{\text{J}}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} $$
  
Substitute the energy in joules:  

$$ E_{\text{eV}} = \frac{3.055 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} = 1.907 $$
  
Round to six significant digits:  

$$ E_{\text{eV}} = 1.90746 $$
  

**Verification via unit conversion factor**  
The product $hc$ in eV·nm is a common constant. Compute:  

$$ hc = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (2.998 \times 10^8) = 1.986 \times 10^{-25} \ \text{J} \cdot \text{m} $$
  
Convert to eV·nm:  
First, convert J to eV:  

$$ \frac{1.986 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} = 1.239 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{eV} \cdot \text{m} $$
  
Then convert meters to nanometers:  

$$ 1.239 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{eV} \cdot \text{m} \times 10^9 \ \text{nm/m} = 1239 \ \text{eV} \cdot \text{nm} $$
  
Energy formula in eV and nm:  

$$ E = \frac{1239}{\lambda_{\text{nm}}} $$
  
For $\lambda = 650 \ \text{nm}$:  

$$ E = \frac{1239}{650} = 1.90615 $$
  
Using precise constants (as in Step 3) gives higher accuracy, so $1.90746 \ \text{eV}$ is retained.

## Answer
$$\boxed{1.90746}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
  The speed of light in a vacuum, denoted as $c$, is a fundamental constant of nature. When light travels through a transparent medium, it slows down due to interactions with atoms in the material. The refractive index $n$ of a medium quantifies this reduction and is defined as $n = c / v$, where $v$ is the speed of light in the medium. For water, the refractive index is approximately 1.33 under standard conditions. This property is crucial for understanding phenomena like refraction, which governs how lenses focus light and how optical fibers transmit data.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  1. Definition of refractive index and its relationship to the speed of light.
  2. Algebraic manipulation of the formula $n = c / v$ to solve for $v$.
  3. Interpretation of dimensionless constants in physical equations.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  This concept links to wave optics (e.g., Snell's law for refraction), electromagnetic theory (permittivity and permeability of media), and relativity (universal speed limit $c$). It also extends to dispersion, where $n$ varies with wavelength.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  In engineering, refractive index governs fiber-optic communication bandwidth. In earth sciences, it helps analyze seismic wave analogs. In biology, it explains vision correction via eyeglasses and microscope resolution limits.

Real-World Applications:
  - Designing camera lenses and corrective eyewear.
  - Optimizing light transmission in underwater telecommunications.
  - Developing lab-on-a-chip devices that use microfluidics to detect pollutants via refractive index changes.

Problem Statement:
  The refractive index of pure water at 20°C is precisely 4/3. Derive an expression for the speed of light $v$ in water in terms of the speed of light in vacuum $c$. Simplify your answer to a single fractional expression.  
  Express your final answer as a simplified fraction multiplied by $c$.

## Solution
**Step 1: State the definition of refractive index**  
The refractive index $n$ is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum $c$ to the speed of light in the medium $v$:  
$$ n = \frac{c}{v} $$  

**Step 2: Substitute the given refractive index**  
For water, $n = \frac{4}{3}$:  
$$ \frac{4}{3} = \frac{c}{v} $$  

**Step 3: Solve for $v$**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $v$:  
$$ v = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{c}{\frac{4}{3}} $$  

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal:  
$$ v = c \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{4}c $$  

**Conclusion**

## Answer

## Problem 3
**Background**  
When light travels from one medium to another, its speed and wavelength change due to the refractive index of the medium, while the frequency remains constant. This phenomenon is critical in optics, especially for devices like spectroscopes and optical fibers, where wavelength shifts affect measurements and signal transmission. The refractive index $n$ of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum $c$ to its speed in the medium $v$: $n = c / v$. For light entering glass from air, the wavelength decreases, causing a measurable shift.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Relationship between wavelength, frequency, and speed of light ($v = f\lambda$).  
2. Constancy of frequency during medium transitions.  
3. Definition of refractive index ($n = c / v$).  
4. Derivation of wavelength shift using algebraic substitution.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to wave optics (refraction and dispersion) and electromagnetic theory (light as an electromagnetic wave). It also underpins applications in lens design and spectroscopy.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The concept applies to engineering (fiber-optic communications), astronomy (atmospheric corrections for telescopes), and materials science (characterizing optical properties of media).  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Spectroscopy**: Correcting observed wavelengths in glass prisms to vacuum-equivalent values.  
- **Telecommunications**: Compensating for wavelength shifts in optical fibers to maintain signal integrity.  
- **Microscopy**: Accounting for wavelength changes in immersion oil to improve resolution.  

**Problem Statement**  
A monochromatic light beam of wavelength $\lambda_0$ in air enters a glass block with refractive index $n$. Derive an expression for the wavelength shift $\Delta\lambda$, defined as $\Delta\lambda = \lambda_0 - \lambda_g$, where $\lambda_g$ is the wavelength in glass. Express $\Delta\lambda$ symbolically in terms of $\lambda_0$ and $n$.  

Then, for $\lambda_0 = 600  \text{nm}$ and $n = 1.5$, compute the numerical value of $\Delta\lambda$. Provide only the numerical part of your answer in nanometers (nm), rounded to three significant digits.

## Solution
### Step 1: Relate wavelength and frequency  
The frequency $f$ of light remains constant when transitioning between media. In air (approximated as vacuum), the speed of light is $c$, so:  
$$ c = f \lambda_0 $$  
In glass, the speed of light $v$ is:  
$$ v = f \lambda_g $$  

### Step 2: Incorporate refractive index  
The refractive index $n$ of glass is defined as:  
$$ n = \frac{c}{v} $$  
Substitute $v = f \lambda_g$:  
$$ n = \frac{c}{f \lambda_g} $$  

### Step 3: Express $\lambda_g$ in terms of $\lambda_0$  
From $c = f \lambda_0$, solve for $f$:  
$$ f = \frac{c}{\lambda_0} $$  
Substitute into the refractive index equation:  
$$ n = \frac{c}{\left( \frac{c}{\lambda_0} \right) \lambda_g} = \frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda_g} $$  
Thus,  
$$ \lambda_g = \frac{\lambda_0}{n} $$  

### Step 4: Derive the wavelength shift  
The shift is defined as:  
$$ \Delta\lambda = \lambda_0 - \lambda_g $$  
Substitute $\lambda_g = \lambda_0 / n$:  
$$ \Delta\lambda = \lambda_0 - \frac{\lambda_0}{n} = \lambda_0 \left(1 - \frac{1}{n}\right) $$  

### Step 5: Compute numerical value  
Given $\lambda_0 = 600  \text{nm}$ and $n = 1.5$:  
$$ \Delta\lambda = 600 \left(1 - \frac{1}{1.5}\right) = 600 \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200  \text{nm} $$  
The answer, rounded to three significant digits, is $200$.

# energy in pendulum motion

## Problem 0
Background:
  A simple pendulum is a mass suspended by a string that swings under gravity. This problem explores the energy transformations during its motion. When released from an angle $\theta$, the pendulum converts gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy. The goal is to derive the speed at the lowest point using conservation of energy, a fundamental principle where total mechanical energy (potential + kinetic) remains constant in the absence of non-conservative forces.

  Knowledge Points Tested:
    - Conservation of mechanical energy.
    - Gravitational potential energy in a pendulum system.
    - Relationship between pendulum geometry and energy conversion.
    - Trigonometric identities for exact expression of height differences.

  Intradisciplinary Connections:
    - Connects to harmonic motion, as pendulums exhibit approximately simple harmonic motion for small angles.
    - Relates to work-energy theorem, where the net work done by gravity equals the change in kinetic energy.
    - Extends to rotational dynamics, as the pendulum motion can be analyzed using torque and angular acceleration.

  Interdisciplinary Connections:
    - Physics and Engineering: Pendulum principles apply in seismometers, clock mechanisms, and energy-harvesting devices.
    - Earth Sciences: Pendulum behavior helps model natural oscillations in geological systems.
    - Biomechanics: Analyzes energy transfer in human motion (e.g., swinging limbs).

  Real-World Applications:
    - Grandfather clocks use pendulum regularity for timekeeping.
    - Earthquake detection systems employ pendulums to sense ground motion.
    - Amusement park rides (e.g., pirate ship swings) optimize pendulum dynamics for safety and thrill.

Problem:
  A simple pendulum of length $L$ and mass $m$ is released from rest at an initial angle $\theta$ (measured from the vertical). Derive an expression for the speed of the pendulum bob at the lowest point of its trajectory. Ignore air resistance and friction. 

  Express the speed in terms of $g$ (gravitational acceleration), $L$, and $\theta$. Use trigonometric identities to simplify your expression.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define energy at initial position (release point)**  
- The bob is at height $h$ above the lowest point. From geometry, the height difference is:  
  $$ h = L - L\cos\theta = L(1 - \cos\theta) $$  
  ![Pendulum height diagram](https://tinyurl.com/pendulum-height-diagram)  
- Initial kinetic energy is 0 (released from rest).  
- Initial gravitational potential energy: $U_i = mgh = mgL(1 - \cos\theta)$.  
- Total initial energy: $E_i = U_i + K_i = mgL(1 - \cos\theta) + 0$.  

**Step 2: Define energy at lowest point**  
- Height is 0 (reference point for potential energy).  
- Potential energy: $U_f = 0$.  
- Kinetic energy: $K_f = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the speed.  
- Total final energy: $E_f = 0 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2$.  

**Step 3: Apply conservation of energy**  
Since no non-conservative forces act:  
$$ E_i = E_f $$  
Substitute expressions:  
$$ mgL(1 - \cos\theta) = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$  

**Step 4: Solve for $v$**  
Divide both sides by $m$:  
$$ gL(1 - \cos\theta) = \frac{1}{2}v^2 $$  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
$$ 2gL(1 - \cos\theta) = v^2 $$  
Take the square root:  
$$ v = \sqrt{2gL(1 - \cos\theta)} $$  

**Step 5: Simplify using trigonometric identity**  
Use the identity $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$:  
$$ v = \sqrt{2gL \cdot 2\sin^2(\theta/2)} = \sqrt{4gL \sin^2(\theta/2)} $$  
Simplify:  
$$ v = 2 \sin(\theta/2) \sqrt{gL} $$

## Answer
$$ \boxed{2 \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \sqrt{gL}} $$

## Problem 1
### Background
A simple pendulum consists of a point mass $m$ (called the bob) attached to a massless string of length $L$. When displaced from its equilibrium (vertical) position and released, it swings under the influence of gravity. The motion involves a continuous exchange between kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy. At the highest point of its swing (maximum displacement angle $\theta$), the bob has zero kinetic energy and maximum potential energy. As it descends to the lowest point (equilibrium), potential energy converts entirely to kinetic energy, reaching a maximum value. This problem explores energy conservation to derive the maximum kinetic energy.

### Knowledge Points Tested
- Conservation of mechanical energy (no dissipative forces).
- Gravitational potential energy relative to a reference point.
- Trigonometric relationships in pendulum geometry.
- Conversion of angular displacement to linear height.

### Intradisciplinary Connections
Connects to harmonic motion (pendulum period), rotational dynamics (torque and angular acceleration), and calculus (energy as a function of position). Reinforces fundamental principles of work-energy theorem and conservative forces.

### Interdisciplinary Connections
- Engineering: Efficiency analysis in mechanical systems (e.g., swings, cranes).
- Earth sciences: Modeling tidal forces or seismic wave oscillations.
- Biomechanics: Energy transfer in human locomotion (e.g., leg swing during walking).

### Real-World Applications
- Grandfather clocks: Pendulum regulation for timekeeping.
- Energy harvesting: Converting pendulum motion to electricity in wave-energy converters.
- Structural engineering: Damping oscillations in buildings and bridges.

### Problem Statement
A simple pendulum of mass $m$ and length $L$ is released from rest at an initial angle $\theta$ from the vertical. Derive an expression for the maximum kinetic energy $K_{\text{max}}$ of the bob during its swing, in terms of $m$, $g$, $L$, and $\theta$. Then, using the values $m = 0.5  \text{kg}$, $L = 2  \text{m}$, $\theta = 45^\circ$, and $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$, compute the numerical value of $K_{\text{max}}$.

**Express your final answer in joules, providing only the numerical value rounded to three significant digits.**  
**Note:**  
- Use degrees for trigonometric functions (omit the degree symbol; e.g., $\cos(45)$, not $\cos(45^\circ)$).  
- $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$ is given; all other constants remain symbolic in the derivation.

## Solution
### Step-by-Step Derivation

#### Step 1: Define the energy conservation principle
The total mechanical energy is conserved (no friction or air resistance). At release (point A), kinetic energy is zero (released from rest), so the total energy is entirely gravitational potential energy. At the lowest point (point B), potential energy is minimized (reference point), so kinetic energy is maximized. Thus:

$$
U_A + K_A = U_B + K_B
$$

where:
- $U_A$ = potential energy at A,
- $K_A = 0$ (initial kinetic energy),
- $U_B = 0$ (reference potential energy at lowest point),
- $K_B = K_{\text{max}}$.

This simplifies to:

$$
U_A = K_{\text{max}}
$$


#### Step 2: Express height at release point
The height difference $h$ between point A (release) and point B (lowest point) is needed for $U_A = m g h$. From geometry:
- At point B, the bob is at the bottom of the arc (vertical position = $-L$ from pivot).
- At point A, the vertical position of the bob relative to the pivot is $-L \cos \theta$.
- Thus, the height $h$ of point A *above* point B is:

$$
h = L - L \cos \theta = L(1 - \cos \theta)
$$


#### Step 3: Derive potential energy at A
Substitute $h$ into potential energy:

$$
U_A = m g L (1 - \cos \theta)
$$


#### Step 4: Apply energy conservation
From Step 1:

$$
K_{\text{max}} = U_A = m g L (1 - \cos \theta)
$$


#### Step 5: Numerical computation
Given:
- $m = 0.5  \text{kg}$,
- $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$,
- $L = 2  \text{m}$,
- $\theta = 45^\circ$.

First, compute $1 - \cos \theta$:

$$
\cos(45) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.70710678118, \quad \text{so} \quad 1 - \cos(45) \approx 1 - 0.70710678118 = 0.29289321882
$$


Now substitute:

$$
K_{\text{max}} = (0.5) \cdot (9.8) \cdot (2) \cdot (0.29289321882)
$$

Calculate step-by-step:

$$
0.5 \times 9.8 = 4.9
$$


$$
4.9 \times 2 = 9.8
$$


$$
9.8 \times 0.29289321882 = 2.870353544436
$$


Round to three significant digits:

$$
2.870353544436 \approx 2.87
$$


**Final numerical value:** $K_{\text{max}} = 2.87  \text{J}$ (joules), but provide only the number as instructed.

## Answer
$$\boxed{2.87}$$

## Problem 2
### Background  
A pendulum is a classic system in physics where a mass (called the bob) is suspended from a fixed point by a string or rod. When displaced from its equilibrium position and released, it swings back and forth under gravity. This problem explores the energy transformation during the swing. At the highest point, the bob has maximum gravitational potential energy and zero kinetic energy. As it descends, potential energy converts to kinetic energy, reaching maximum speed at the lowest point. This energy interchange illustrates the conservation of mechanical energy, a foundational principle in physics.  

#### Knowledge Points Tested  
1. **Conservation of mechanical energy**: Total energy (kinetic + potential) remains constant in the absence of non-conservative forces.  
2. **Gravitational potential energy**: Near Earth’s surface, $ U = mgh $, where $ h $ is height above a reference level.  
3. **Kinetic energy**: $ K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $, dependent on mass and speed.  
4. **Critical points in pendulum motion**: Speed is maximized at the lowest point, and minimized (zero) at the highest points.  

#### Intradisciplinary Connections  
- **Forces and motion**: The net force at the lowest point provides centripetal acceleration, but energy methods simplify speed/height relationships.  
- **Work-energy theorem**: The work done by gravity equals the change in kinetic energy, reinforcing energy conservation.  
- **Simple harmonic motion**: For small angles, pendulums exhibit SHM, but energy conservation holds for all amplitudes.  

#### Interdisciplinary Connections  
- **Engineering**: Pendulum principles apply to dampers in skyscrapers and timing mechanisms in clocks.  
- **Sports science**: Understanding energy transfer optimizes motions like a gymnast’s swing on high bars.  
- **Geophysics**: Pendulum-based seismometers detect ground motion by measuring energy conversions during earthquakes.  

#### Real-World Applications  
- **Roller coasters**: The maximum speed at the bottom of a hill is determined by the drop height, via $ v^2 \propto h $.  
- **Hydropower**: Water turbines convert gravitational potential energy ($ mgh $) into kinetic energy of rotation, analogous to the pendulum bob.  
- **Bungee jumping**: Energy conservation predicts jumper speed at the lowest point based on initial jump height.  

### Problem Statement  
Consider a pendulum bob of mass $ m $ attached to a massless string. The bob is released from rest at an initial height $ h $ above its lowest point (equilibrium position). At the lowest point, the bob attains a maximum speed $ v $. Assume no air resistance or friction.  

Using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, derive an expression for the initial release height $ h $ in terms of $ v $ and the acceleration due to gravity $ g $.  

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $ v $ and $ g $.

## Solution
#### Step 1: Define the reference point for potential energy  
Set the gravitational potential energy $ U = 0 $ at the lowest point (equilibrium position). This simplifies calculations since all heights are measured relative to this point.  

#### Step 2: Write expressions for total energy at initial and final points  
- **At release (initial point)**:  
  - Height above reference: $ h $.  
  - Speed: $ 0 $ (released from rest).  
  - Gravitational potential energy: $ U_i = mgh $.  
  - Kinetic energy: $ K_i = \frac{1}{2}m(0)^2 = 0 $.  
  - Total mechanical energy: $ E_i = U_i + K_i = mgh $.  

- **At lowest point (final point)**:  
  - Height above reference: $ 0 $.  
  - Speed: $ v $ (maximum speed).  
  - Gravitational potential energy: $ U_f = mg(0) = 0 $.  
  - Kinetic energy: $ K_f = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $.  
  - Total mechanical energy: $ E_f = U_f + K_f = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $.  

#### Step 3: Apply conservation of mechanical energy  
Since no non-conservative forces (e.g., friction) act, total energy is conserved:  

$$ E_i = E_f $$
  
Substitute the expressions:  

$$ mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$
  

#### Step 4: Solve for $ h $  
Divide both sides by $ m $ (assuming $ m \neq 0 $):  

$$ gh = \frac{1}{2}v^2 $$
  
Divide both sides by $ g $:  

$$ h = \frac{v^2}{2g} $$
  

#### Conclusion  
The initial release height $ h $ is $ \frac{v^2}{2g} $. This result shows that height depends quadratically on speed and inversely on gravity, independent of mass or string length.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{v^{2}}{2g}}$$

------
## Problem 3
**Background:**  
Consider a simple pendulum consisting of a point mass $m$ attached to a massless string of length $L$. When released from an initial angular displacement $\theta$ (measured from the vertical), the pendulum oscillates under gravity (acceleration $g$). Due to non-conservative forces like air resistance, the pendulum loses 10% of its total mechanical energy during each full swing. A "swing" is defined as the motion from one maximum angular displacement to the next maximum displacement on the opposite side. At each maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is entirely potential. The potential energy at an angle $\phi$ is given by $U = mgL(1 - \cos\phi)$.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Conservation of mechanical energy with dissipative losses.  
- Relationship between potential energy and angular displacement in a pendulum.  
- Application of inverse trigonometric functions.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem connects to the broader topic of oscillatory motion, where energy dissipation leads to amplitude decay. It also reinforces the principle that energy conservation (modified for losses) provides a powerful tool for analyzing motion without solving differential equations.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Energy dissipation models are crucial in engineering (e.g., damping in mechanical systems) and environmental science (e.g., energy loss in natural oscillators like bridges during earthquakes).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Pendulum energy loss models are used in seismometers to damp oscillations and in pendulum clocks to design mechanisms that compensate for energy loss.  

**Problem Statement:**  
A pendulum is released from rest at an initial angle $\theta$ relative to the vertical. During each full swing (from one maximum angle to the next maximum angle on the opposite side), the pendulum loses 10% of its total mechanical energy due to dissipative forces. Derive an expression for the maximum angle $\theta_2$ reached at the end of the second swing. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $\theta$, using $\arccos$ and $\cos$.  

**Final Answer Format Requirement:**  
- Express $\theta_2$ as $\arccos(\text{expression})$.  
- Use $\theta$ as the variable for the initial angle.  
- Do not substitute numerical values for any constants.  
- Angle units are radians; omit the radian unit in the answer.  
- Use the notation $\arccos$ (not $\cos^{-1}$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Express initial total energy**  
At the initial release (angle $\theta$), the total mechanical energy $E_0$ is entirely potential:  

$$
E_0 = mgL(1 - \cos\theta).
$$


**Step 2: Apply energy loss after the first swing**  
After the first swing (ending at the maximum angle on the opposite side), the pendulum loses 10% of $E_0$. The remaining energy $E_1$ is:  

$$
E_1 = E_0 - 0.10E_0 = 0.90E_0.
$$
  
Substituting $E_0$:  

$$
E_1 = 0.90 \cdot mgL(1 - \cos\theta).
$$


**Step 3: Apply energy loss after the second swing**  
After the second swing (ending at the next maximum angle, back toward the starting side), the pendulum loses 10% of $E_1$. The remaining energy $E_2$ is:  

$$
E_2 = E_1 - 0.10E_1 = 0.90E_1.
$$
  
Substituting $E_1$:  

$$
E_2 = 0.90 \cdot \left[0.90 \cdot mgL(1 - \cos\theta)\right] = (0.90)^2 \cdot mgL(1 - \cos\theta).
$$
  
Simplifying:  

$$
E_2 = 0.81 \, mgL(1 - \cos\theta).
$$


**Step 4: Relate $E_2$ to the maximum angle $\theta_2$**  
At the end of the second swing, the energy $E_2$ is entirely potential, so:  

$$
E_2 = mgL(1 - \cos\theta_2).
$$
  
Equating this to the expression from Step 3:  

$$
mgL(1 - \cos\theta_2) = 0.81 \, mgL(1 - \cos\theta).
$$
  
Divide both sides by $mgL$ (assuming $m$, $g$, and $L$ are non-zero):  

$$
1 - \cos\theta_2 = 0.81 (1 - \cos\theta).
$$


**Step 5: Solve for $\cos\theta_2$**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $\cos\theta_2$:  

$$
\cos\theta_2 = 1 - 0.81(1 - \cos\theta).
$$


**Step 6: Solve for $\theta_2$**  
Take the inverse cosine of both sides:  

$$
\theta_2 = \arccos\left[1 - 0.81(1 - \cos\theta)\right].
$$

This is the maximum angle at the end of the second swing.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\arccos\left(1 - 0.81\left(1 - \cos\theta\right)\right)}$$

# energy loss due to friction

## Problem 0
**Background**:  
In engineering and physics, friction is a critical force that dissipates energy and affects motion. While introductory problems often assume a constant friction coefficient, real-world surfaces (like roads with varying materials or brake pads with uneven wear) exhibit position-dependent friction. This problem explores how such variations influence energy loss.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. Kinetic friction force: $f_k = \mu_k N$, where $N$ is the normal force.  
2. Work done by a variable force: $W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{s}$.  
3. Integration of linear functions.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem connects friction to the work-energy theorem, as the work done by friction equals the change in mechanical energy. It also reinforces force decomposition in dynamics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
Variable friction models appear in mechanical engineering (e.g., brake system design) and materials science (e.g., studying wear in composite surfaces).  

**Real-World Applications**:  
- Predicting stopping distances for vehicles on roads with patchy ice or oil spills.  
- Designing conveyor belts with segmented surfaces to optimize energy efficiency.  

**Problem**:  
A block of mass $m$ slides along a straight horizontal surface. The kinetic friction coefficient $\mu_k$ varies linearly with the distance $x$ traveled from the starting point: $\mu_k(x) = \mu_0 + \alpha x$, where $\mu_0$ and $\alpha$ are constants. The block moves a total distance $d$. Derive an expression for the work done by the friction force during this motion.  

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $m$, $g$ (acceleration due to gravity), $\mu_0$, $\alpha$, and $d$.  

**Final Answer Instructions**:  
- Provide a single symbolic expression enclosed in `\boxed{}`.  
- Use only the variables $m$, $g$, $\mu_0$, $\alpha$, and $d$.  
- Omit units; include only the expression.

## Solution
### Step 1: Determine the friction force  
The normal force $N$ on a horizontal surface equals the weight of the block:  
$$ N = mg $$  
The kinetic friction force $f_k$ depends on position $x$:  
$$ f_k(x) = \mu_k(x) N = (\mu_0 + \alpha x) mg $$  

### Step 2: Set up the work integral  
Work done by friction is the integral of the friction force dot displacement. Since friction opposes motion, $\vec{f_k} \cdot d\vec{x} = -f_k  dx$:  
$$ W = \int_{0}^{d} \vec{f_k} \cdot d\vec{x} = \int_{0}^{d} -f_k(x)  dx $$  
Substitute $f_k(x)$:  
$$ W = -\int_{0}^{d} (\mu_0 + \alpha x) mg  dx $$  

### Step 3: Factor out constants  
$m$, $g$, $\mu_0$, and $\alpha$ are independent of $x$:  
$$ W = -mg \int_{0}^{d} (\mu_0 + \alpha x)  dx $$  

### Step 4: Evaluate the integral  
$$ \int_{0}^{d} (\mu_0 + \alpha x)  dx = \left[ \mu_0 x + \frac{\alpha}{2} x^2 \right]_{0}^{d} = \mu_0 d + \frac{\alpha}{2} d^2 $$  

### Step 5: Substitute and simplify  
$$ W = -mg \left( \mu_0 d + \frac{\alpha d^2}{2} \right) $$  
Factor $d$:  
$$ W = -mg d \left( \mu_0 + \frac{\alpha d}{2} \right) $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{ -mgd \left( \mu_0 + \dfrac{\alpha d}{2} \right) }$$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
In automotive safety, understanding stopping distances is critical. Real-world friction between tires and the road often depends on speed due to the viscoelastic properties of rubber. For instance, in high-performance racing tires, the friction coefficient can increase with speed, leading to non-constant deceleration during braking. This problem explores energy loss through a variable-friction model.

- Work-energy theorem and kinetic energy dissipation  
- Integration techniques for velocity-dependent acceleration  
- Frictional forces and energy conversion  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
Connects kinematics (motion under deceleration) and dynamics (force models) through calculus, reinforcing the work-energy theorem as a unifying principle for variable forces.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Relates to materials science (viscoelastic tire behavior) and automotive engineering (braking system design).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Predicting stopping distances for vehicles with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), where friction coefficients vary dynamically to prevent skidding.  

---

**Problem Statement**  
A car of mass $m$ moves at initial velocity $v$ on a flat road. When braking, the kinetic friction coefficient $\mu$ varies with speed as $\mu = \mu_0 \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right)$, where $\mu_0$ and $v_0$ are positive constants. Derive an expression for the stopping distance $s$ in terms of $m$, $v$, $\mu_0$, $v_0$, and $g$ (gravitational acceleration).  

**Requirements**  
- Use the work-energy theorem.  
- Express $s$ symbolically.  
- Use $\ln$ for natural logarithm (e.g., $\ln(3x)$, **not** $\log$).  
- Box your final answer as $\boxed{s = \text{expression}}$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Friction force model**  
The kinetic friction force is $f_k = \mu N$, where $N = mg$ is the normal force. Substituting the given friction model:  

$$
f_k = \mu_0 \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right) mg
$$


**Step 2: Work-energy theorem**  
The work done by friction equals the change in kinetic energy. Initial kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$; final is $0$:  

$$
W = -\frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
  
Work is also the integral of force over distance:  

$$
W = \int_0^s -f_k  dx = -\int_0^s \mu_0 \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right) mg  dx
$$
  
Equating both expressions:  

$$
\int_0^s \mu_0 \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right) mg  dx = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
  
Mass $m$ cancels:  

$$
\mu_0 g \int_0^s \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right)  dx = \frac{1}{2}v^2 \quad (1)
$$


**Step 3: Relate velocity to position**  
Acceleration $a = dv/dt$, and by chain rule:  

$$
a = \frac{dv}{dt} = v \frac{dv}{dx}
$$
  
Newton’s second law gives $a = -f_k / m = -\mu_0 \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right) g$. Thus:  

$$
v \frac{dv}{dx} = -\mu_0 g \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right)
$$
  
Rearranging:  

$$
dx = -\frac{v  dv}{\mu_0 g \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right)} \quad (2)
$$


**Step 4: Solve the integral**  
Substitute (2) into (1). Limits: $x = 0$ to $s$ corresponds to $v = v$ to $0$:  

$$
\int_0^s \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right)  dx = -\int_v^0 \frac{v \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right)}{\mu_0 g \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right)} \cdot \frac{dv}{\mu_0 g \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right)} \cdot \mu_0 g
$$
  
Simplify the integrand:  

$$
\int_0^s \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right)  dx = \frac{1}{\mu_0 g} \int_0^v \frac{v}{1 + \frac{v}{v_0}}  dv
$$
  
The right-hand side of (1) becomes:  

$$
\mu_0 g \cdot \frac{1}{\mu_0 g} \int_0^v \frac{v}{1 + \frac{v}{v_0}}  dv = \frac{1}{2}v^2
$$
  
So:  

$$
\int_0^v \frac{v}{1 + \frac{v}{v_0}}  dv = \frac{1}{2}v^2 \quad (3)
$$


**Step 5: Evaluate the integral**  
Simplify the integrand in (3):  

$$
\frac{v}{1 + \frac{v}{v_0}} = \frac{v}{\frac{v_0 + v}{v_0}} = \frac{v v_0}{v_0 + v}
$$
  
Use substitution: $u = v_0 + v$, so $du = dv$ and $v = u - v_0$. When $v = 0$, $u = v_0$; when $v = v$, $u = v_0 + v$:  

$$
\int_0^v \frac{v v_0}{v_0 + v}  dv = v_0 \int_{v_0}^{v_0 + v} \frac{u - v_0}{u}  du = v_0 \int_{v_0}^{v_0 + v} \left(1 - \frac{v_0}{u}\right)  du
$$
  
Integrate:  

$$
v_0 \left[ u - v_0 \ln u \right]_{v_0}^{v_0 + v} = v_0 \left[ (v_0 + v - v_0 \ln(v_0 + v)) - (v_0 - v_0 \ln v_0) \right]
$$
  

$$
= v_0 \left[ v + v_0 - v_0 \ln(v_0 + v) - v_0 + v_0 \ln v_0 \right] = v_0 v - v_0^2 \ln \left(\frac{v_0 + v}{v_0}\right)
$$
  
Equation (3) now gives:  

$$
v_0 v - v_0^2 \ln \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right) = \frac{1}{2}v^2
$$
  
Solve for $s$ by substituting into (1):  

$$
\mu_0 g s = v_0 v - v_0^2 \ln \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right) \quad \text{(from the work integral)}
$$
  

$$
s = \frac{1}{\mu_0 g} \left( v_0 v - v_0^2 \ln \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right) \right)
$$
  
Factor $v_0$:  

$$
s = \frac{v_0}{\mu_0 g} \left( v - v_0 \ln \left(1 + \frac{v}{v_0}\right) \right)
$$

## Answer
$$
\boxed{\dfrac{v_0}{\mu_0 g} \left( v - v_0 \ln \left(1 + \dfrac{v}{v_0}\right) \right)}
$$

## Problem 2
**Background**

Inclined planes are ubiquitous in everyday life, ranging from wheelchair ramps to mountain roads. When objects slide down inclines, friction converts mechanical energy into thermal energy, reducing efficiency and generating heat. This energy loss is critical in engineering applications like braking systems and conveyor belts, where minimizing friction improves performance and safety. Understanding the quantitative relationship between friction and energy dissipation requires modeling forces and work on an incline.

**Knowledge Points Tested**
1. Force decomposition on an inclined plane.
2. Relationship between normal force and kinetic friction.
3. Work-energy principle for constant forces.
4. Energy dissipation due to non-conservative forces.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
- Connects to Newtonian mechanics (force analysis) and conservation of energy (friction as a non-conservative force).
- Extends to power calculations by differentiating energy with respect to time.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
- Mechanical engineering: Efficiency analysis of inclined transport systems.
- Materials science: Friction coefficients depend on surface properties.

**Real-World Applications**
- Calculating energy loss in ski slopes for safety assessments.
- Designing efficient loading ramps in warehouses to reduce heat generation in machinery.

**Problem Statement**

A box of mass $m$ slides down an incline angled at $\theta$ degrees relative to the horizontal. The kinetic friction coefficient between the box and the incline is $\mu_k$. Over a sliding distance $L$ along the incline, determine the energy dissipated due to friction. Derive the expression step by step, starting from fundamental principles.

**Requirements for Final Answer**
- Express the energy lost symbolically in terms of $m$, $\theta$, $\mu_k$, $L$, and gravitational acceleration $g$.
- Use $\cos \theta$ for the cosine of $\theta$ (where $\theta$ is in degrees).
- Multiply variables implicitly (e.g., write $mgL$, not $m \times g \times L$).
- Box the final expression without additional text.

## Solution
**Step 1: Resolve gravitational force**  
The weight $mg$ acts vertically downward. Decompose it into:  
- Parallel component (down incline): $mg \sin \theta$  
- Perpendicular component (into incline): $mg \cos \theta$  

**Step 2: Determine normal force**  
Since there is no acceleration perpendicular to the incline, the normal force $N$ balances the perpendicular component:  

$$ N = mg \cos \theta $$
  

**Step 3: Calculate friction force**  
Kinetic friction opposes motion and is given by:  

$$ f_k = \mu_k N = \mu_k (mg \cos \theta) $$
  

**Step 4: Compute work done by friction**  
Friction acts opposite to displacement. Work done by friction over distance $L$ is:  

$$ W_{\text{friction}} = -f_k L = -\mu_k mg L \cos \theta $$
  
The negative sign indicates energy dissipation.  

**Step 5: Find energy lost**  
The energy lost to friction is the magnitude of this work:  

$$ \text{Energy lost} = |W_{\text{friction}}| = \mu_k mg L \cos \theta $$
  
This represents mechanical energy converted to heat.

## Answer
\[ \boxed{\mu_k m g L \cos \theta} \]

## Problem 3
Background:
  In mechanical systems, springs store energy when compressed or stretched. This energy is converted into kinetic energy when released. However, friction dissipates energy as heat, reducing the motion. This problem explores how friction affects the energy transfer in a spring-block system on a rough surface.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  1. Spring potential energy: $ U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 $
  2. Work-energy theorem for non-conservative forces: $ W_{\text{non-conservative}} = \Delta K + \Delta U $
  3. Energy dissipation by friction: Friction converts mechanical energy into thermal energy.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  Connects spring potential energy (Hooke's law) to friction (Newtonian mechanics) via the work-energy theorem. Also relates to conservation of energy principles.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  Links to thermodynamics (energy dissipation as heat) and material science (friction properties of surfaces).

Real-World Applications:
  Applies to braking systems (e.g., friction brakes in vehicles), shock absorbers, and mechanical systems where damping is needed to control oscillations.

Problem Statement:
  A block of mass $ m $ is attached to a spring with spring constant $ k $. The block rests on a horizontal surface with kinetic friction force $ f $ opposing motion. The spring is initially compressed by a distance $ x $ from its natural length, and the block is held at rest. After release, the block moves and eventually comes to rest. Derive an expression for the total energy dissipated by friction during this process. Express your answer in terms of $ k $ and $ x $.

Important: The final answer must be a symbolic expression using the given variables $ k $ and $ x $. Do not include $ m $ or $ f $ in the final expression. Use exact fractions and exponents as needed.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify initial and final mechanical energy**  
The initial mechanical energy is the spring potential energy since the block is at rest:  

$$ E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 $$
  
The final mechanical energy is zero because the block is at rest and the spring is at its natural length (no potential energy):  

$$ E_{\text{final}} = 0 $$
  

**Step 2: Apply the work-energy theorem for non-conservative forces**  
The work done by friction (a non-conservative force) equals the change in mechanical energy:  

$$ W_{\text{friction}} = \Delta K + \Delta U $$
  
Since the initial and final kinetic energies are both zero:  

$$ \Delta K = 0 $$
  
The change in potential energy is:  

$$ \Delta U = U_{\text{final}} - U_{\text{initial}} = 0 - \frac{1}{2} k x^2 = -\frac{1}{2} k x^2 $$
  
Substitute into the work-energy theorem:  

$$ W_{\text{friction}} = 0 + \left( -\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \right) = -\frac{1}{2} k x^2 $$
  

**Step 3: Interpret the work done by friction**  
The work done by friction is negative because friction opposes motion. The magnitude of this work equals the energy dissipated as heat:  

$$ \text{Energy dissipated} = |W_{\text{friction}}| = \left| -\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \right| = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 $$
  

**Key Insight:**  
The energy dissipated by friction is independent of the friction force $ f $ and mass $ m $. It equals the initial spring energy because friction converts all mechanical energy into heat. The friction force only affects the stopping distance and time, not the total energy dissipated.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2} k x^{2}}$$

## Problem 4
### Background
A pendulum is a classic system in physics that exhibits periodic motion under gravity. When displaced from equilibrium, the pendulum bob swings back and forth, but in real-world scenarios, air resistance causes energy loss through friction. For small angular displacements, the motion approximates simple harmonic motion, but with damping. The damping force due to air friction is modeled as linearly proportional to the velocity of the bob, characterized by a damping constant $b$. Understanding energy loss per oscillation is crucial for applications like timekeeping in pendulum clocks, seismometer design, and analyzing mechanical systems with oscillations.

### Knowledge Points Tested
- Energy conservation and loss in oscillatory systems.
- Damped harmonic motion under a velocity-proportional damping force.
- Small-angle approximation for pendulums.
- Work-energy theorem applied to non-conservative forces.
- Integration of time-dependent quantities over one oscillation period.

### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects pendulum dynamics (mechanics) with energy dissipation concepts. It reinforces the harmonic oscillator model by extending it to damped oscillations, linking to topics like resonance and quality factor in oscillatory systems.

### Interdisciplinary Connections
The principles apply to electrical engineering (damped oscillations in RLC circuits), civil engineering (damping in structural vibrations during earthquakes), and environmental science (modeling natural oscillatory systems with energy loss).

### Real-World Applications
- **Horology**: Pendulum clocks require precise energy compensation to counter frictional losses.
- **Sports Science**: Analyzing energy dissipation in a golf putt's pendulum-like motion.
- **Aerospace**: Modeling oscillations of suspended equipment in aircraft/spacecraft with air resistance.

### Problem Statement
Consider a simple pendulum of mass $m$ and length $L$, released from rest at an initial angular displacement $\theta$ (where $\theta$ is small enough for the small-angle approximation to hold). The pendulum experiences a damping force due to air friction given by $\vec{F}_d = -b \vec{v}$, where $b$ is the damping constant and $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the bob. Assume light damping (i.e., the damping does not significantly alter the oscillation period from the undamped case).

Derive an expression for the energy lost to air friction during one complete oscillation (from the initial release point back to the same angular position after one full swing). Use the following steps in your solution:
1. Express the initial total mechanical energy.
2. Set up the integral for the work done by the damping force over one period.
3. Use the equation of motion and light-damping approximation to evaluate the integral.

Express your final answer symbolically in terms of $m$, $L$, $\theta$, $b$, and $g$ (acceleration due to gravity). Note that not all parameters may appear in the final expression. Use $\pi$ for the mathematical constant pi, and express square roots using the $\sqrt{}$ function.

## Solution
### Step 1: Initial Mechanical Energy
The initial energy is purely potential. At maximum displacement, the height of the bob relative to the lowest point is:

$$
h = L(1 - \cos\theta).
$$

Using the small-angle approximation $\cos\theta \approx 1 - \theta^2/2$:

$$
h \approx L \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}\right)\right) = \frac{L \theta^2}{2}.
$$

Thus, the initial mechanical energy is:

$$
E_0 = m g h = m g \left(\frac{L \theta^2}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} m g L \theta^2.
$$


### Step 2: Work Done by Damping Force
The damping force $\vec{F}_d = -b \vec{v}$ does work on the bob, dissipating energy. The energy lost over one period $T$ is:

$$
\Delta E = \int_0^T \vec{F}_d \cdot d\vec{r} = \int_0^T (-b \vec{v}) \cdot \vec{v}  dt = -b \int_0^T v^2  dt.
$$

The magnitude of energy lost is therefore:

$$
|\Delta E| = b \int_0^T v^2  dt.
$$


### Step 3: Velocity in Damped Harmonic Motion
Under small-angle approximation, the pendulum behaves as a harmonic oscillator with undamped angular frequency:

$$
\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}.
$$

The period of oscillation (undamped) is:

$$
T_0 = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_0} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}.
$$

With light damping, the period $T \approx T_0$. The displacement $s$ along the arc is:

$$
s(t) = L \alpha(t),
$$

where $\alpha(t)$ is the angular displacement. The solution for $\alpha(t)$ is:

$$
\alpha(t) = \theta e^{-\gamma t} \cos(\omega_0 t), \quad \gamma = \frac{b}{2m},
$$

assuming initial conditions $\alpha(0) = \theta$ and $\dot{\alpha}(0) = 0$. The linear velocity is:

$$
v(t) = \frac{ds}{dt} = L \frac{d\alpha}{dt} = L \theta e^{-\gamma t} \left[ -\gamma \cos(\omega_0 t) - \omega_0 \sin(\omega_0 t) \right].
$$

Thus:

$$
v^2(t) = L^2 \theta^2 e^{-2\gamma t} \left[ \gamma^2 \cos^2(\omega_0 t) + 2\gamma\omega_0 \cos(\omega_0 t)\sin(\omega_0 t) + \omega_0^2 \sin^2(\omega_0 t) \right].
$$


### Step 4: Evaluate the Integral
For light damping, $\gamma \ll \omega_0$, so $e^{-2\gamma t} \approx 1$ over one period $T_0$. The integral simplifies to:

$$
\int_0^{T_0} v^2  dt \approx L^2 \theta^2 \int_0^{T_0} \left[ \gamma^2 \cos^2(\omega_0 t) + 2\gamma\omega_0 \cos(\omega_0 t)\sin(\omega_0 t) + \omega_0^2 \sin^2(\omega_0 t) \right] dt.
$$

Using trigonometric identities:

$$
\cos^2(\omega_0 t) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\omega_0 t)}{2}, \quad \sin^2(\omega_0 t) = \frac{1 - \cos(2\omega_0 t)}{2}, \quad \cos(\omega_0 t)\sin(\omega_0 t) = \frac{1}{2} \sin(2\omega_0 t).
$$

The integral becomes:

$$
\int_0^{T_0} v^2  dt \approx L^2 \theta^2 \int_0^{T_0} \left[ \gamma^2 \frac{1 + \cos(2\omega_0 t)}{2} + \gamma\omega_0 \sin(2\omega_0 t) + \omega_0^2 \frac{1 - \cos(2\omega_0 t)}{2} \right] dt.
$$

Terms with $\cos(2\omega_0 t)$ and $\sin(2\omega_0 t)$ integrate to zero over one period. The constant terms yield:

$$
\int_0^{T_0} v^2  dt \approx L^2 \theta^2 \left[ \frac{\gamma^2}{2} T_0 + \frac{\omega_0^2}{2} T_0 \right] = L^2 \theta^2 \frac{T_0}{2} (\gamma^2 + \omega_0^2).
$$

Since $\gamma \ll \omega_0$, $\gamma^2 + \omega_0^2 \approx \omega_0^2$:

$$
\int_0^{T_0} v^2  dt \approx L^2 \theta^2 \frac{T_0}{2} \omega_0^2.
$$

Substitute $T_0 = 2\pi / \omega_0$:

$$
\int_0^{T_0} v^2  dt \approx L^2 \theta^2 \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2\pi}{\omega_0} \cdot \omega_0^2 = \pi L^2 \theta^2 \omega_0.
$$


### Step 5: Energy Loss Expression
The energy lost is:

$$
\Delta E = b \int_0^{T_0} v^2  dt \approx b \pi L^2 \theta^2 \omega_0.
$$

Substitute $\omega_0 = \sqrt{g / L}}$:

$$
\Delta E = b \pi L^2 \theta^2 \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}} = b \pi \theta^2 L^{3/2} \sqrt{g}.
$$

This is the energy lost per oscillation.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\pi b \theta^{2} \sqrt{g}  L^{3/2}}$$

# equivalent resistance calculations

## Problem 0
**Background:**  
In an electrical engineering lab, you are designing a custom circuit for a sensor system. The circuit requires a specific total resistance, achieved by connecting three resistors in series. However, these resistors are not pre-made; they are fabricated from different materials with distinct resistivities. Each resistor is a cylindrical wire of uniform cross-section but varying length and diameter. Your task is to derive the equivalent resistance of this series combination from fundamental principles, accounting for the material properties and geometric dimensions.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Ohm's law and the definition of resistance.  
2. Resistivity ($\rho$) as a material property.  
3. Equivalent resistance for series circuits.  
4. Geometric dependence of resistance ($R = \rho L / A$, where $L$ is length and $A$ is cross-sectional area).  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem integrates concepts from electromagnetism (resistivity, Ohm's law) and circuit theory (series resistance). It reinforces how microscopic material properties ($\rho$) manifest as macroscopic circuit behavior.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Material science (role of resistivity in conductors), geometry (dependence on $L$ and $A$), and practical engineering (circuit design).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Calculating resistance is essential for designing heating elements, sensor circuits, and current-limiting networks. For example, nichrome wires (high $\rho$) are used in toasters, while copper (low $\rho$) is used in low-loss electrical wiring.  

**Problem:**  
Three cylindrical resistors are connected in series:  
- Resistor 1: Material resistivity $\rho_1$, length $L_1$, cross-sectional area $A_1$.  
- Resistor 2: Material resistivity $\rho_2$, length $L_2$, cross-sectional area $A_2$.  
- Resistor 3: Material resistivity $\rho_3$, length $L_3$, cross-sectional area $A_3$.  

Derive an expression for the equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$ of the series combination. Express your answer **symbolically** in terms of $\rho_1$, $L_1$, $A_1$, $\rho_2$, $L_2$, $A_2$, $\rho_3$, $L_3$, and $A_3$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Model individual resistances**  
The resistance $R$ of a uniform conductor is given by:  
$$ R = \rho \frac{L}{A}, $$  
where $\rho$ is the resistivity, $L$ is the length, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. Applying this to each resistor:  
- Resistor 1: $ R_1 = \rho_1 \frac{L_1}{A_1} $,  
- Resistor 2: $ R_2 = \rho_2 \frac{L_2}{A_2} $,  
- Resistor 3: $ R_3 = \rho_3 \frac{L_3}{A_3} $.  

**Step 2: Apply series resistance law**  
For resistors connected in series, the equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$ is the sum of individual resistances:  
$$ R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3. $$  

**Step 3: Substitute expressions**  
Replace $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$ with their derived expressions:  
$$ R_{\text{eq}} = \rho_1 \frac{L_1}{A_1} + \rho_2 \frac{L_2}{A_2} + \rho_3 \frac{L_3}{A_3}. $$  

**Step 4: Simplify to final form**  
The expression is already simplified and represents the equivalent resistance as a function of the given variables.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\rho_1 \frac{L_1}{A_1} + \rho_2 \frac{L_2}{A_2} + \rho_3 \frac{L_3}{A_3}}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
  In electronic circuit design, understanding the equivalent resistance of networks is crucial for predicting current flow and power distribution. This problem explores a symmetric arrangement of four resistors, each of resistance $R$, configured in a diamond topology. The diamond structure appears in lattice-based sensors and certain bridge circuits, where symmetry simplifies analysis. The network consists of four vertices (A, B, C, D) connected by resistors to form a rhombus: resistor $R$ between A and B, $R$ between B and C, $R$ between C and D, and $R$ between D and A. No other connections exist.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  - Identification of parallel current paths in resistor networks
  - Application of the parallel resistance formula $R_{\text{eq}} = \left( \sum \frac{1}{R_i} \right)^{-1}$
  - Simplification of series and parallel combinations

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  - Relates to Kirchhoff's laws for circuit analysis
  - Extends to delta-wye transformations for asymmetric networks
  - Connects to power dissipation calculations ($P = I^2 R_{\text{eq}}$)

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  - Materials science: Models resistance in crystal lattices with tetrahedral symmetry
  - Biomedical engineering: Simulates electrode arrays in impedance tomography
  - Graph theory: Represents edge connectivity in network flow problems

Real-World Applications:
  - Strain gauge configurations in structural health monitoring
  - Quadrupole electrodes in mass spectrometry
  - Redundant circuit design for fault tolerance in power grids

Problem:
  Consider a symmetric diamond-shaped resistor network with four identical resistors. Each resistor has resistance $R$ and connects adjacent vertices of a rhombus: specifically, resistors exist between vertices A-B, B-C, C-D, and D-A. Determine the equivalent resistance between vertices A and B. 

  Express your answer symbolically in terms of $R$. Simplify the expression completely. Use fractions where necessary, written as \frac{numerator}{denominator}. Do not substitute numerical values or compute decimals.

  Required notation: 
    - Multiplication: Implicit (e.g., $R_1 R_2$ or $R \cdot R$)
    - Division: \frac{}{} notation only
    - Final format: A single simplified expression in terms of $R$

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify current paths**  
When a voltage is applied between vertices A and B, current flows through two distinct paths:  
- **Path 1 (Direct):** Through resistor AB ($R$)  
- **Path 2 (Indirect):** Through A → D → C → B, with total resistance $R + R + R = 3R$ (resistors AD, DC, and CB in series)  

**Step 2: Recognize parallel configuration**  
The direct path (resistance $R$) and indirect path (resistance $3R$) are electrically parallel because both connect nodes A and B. The circuit topology confirms no other connections exist between these paths.  

**Step 3: Apply parallel resistance formula**  
The equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$ for two parallel resistors is:  
$$ R_{\text{eq}} = \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)^{-1} $$  
Substitute $R_1 = R$ and $R_2 = 3R$:  
$$ R_{\text{eq}} = \left( \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{3R} \right)^{-1} $$  

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
Combine the reciprocals:  
$$ \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{3R} = \frac{3}{3R} + \frac{1}{3R} = \frac{4}{3R} $$  
Invert the sum:  
$$ R_{\text{eq}} = \left( \frac{4}{3R} \right)^{-1} = \frac{3R}{4} $$  

**Conclusion**

## Problem 2
**Background:**  
In electronic circuit design, resistors are often combined to achieve a desired equivalent resistance. However, manufacturing defects in printed circuit boards (PCBs) can introduce unintended connections that alter the circuit's behavior. Consider a PCB designed to have resistor $R_1$ and $R_2$ in series between nodes $A$ and $B$, with resistor $R_3$ connected in parallel to the series combination. Due to a solder bridge defect during manufacturing, the junction between $R_1$ and $R_2$ (node $X$) is accidentally connected to the midpoint of $R_3$ via a zero-resistance wire. This splits $R_3$ into two equal segments, $R_{3a}$ and $R_{3b}$, each with resistance $R_3/2$, and shorts node $X$ to the midpoint of $R_3$ (node $Z$). The goal is to determine the equivalent resistance between terminals $A$ and $B$ of this modified network.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Equivalent resistance calculations for series and parallel resistor combinations.  
2. Circuit simplification using node combination due to zero-resistance connections.  
3. Analysis of non-ideal circuit modifications caused by real-world defects.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem extends basic series-parallel resistance concepts to complex networks, bridging foundational DC circuit theory with practical troubleshooting skills in electronics. It reinforces Kirchhoff's laws and the principle of equipotential nodes.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
The defect scenario connects physics to electrical engineering (PCB manufacturing tolerances) and materials science (conductivity properties). The mathematical derivation involves rational expressions and algebraic simplification.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Equivalent resistance calculations are essential in power distribution (e.g., load balancing), sensor networks (e.g., Wheatstone bridges for strain gauges), and quality control in electronics assembly (e.g., identifying solder bridges).  

**Problem Statement:**  
A PCB has resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ connected in series between terminals $A$ and $B$. Resistor $R_3$ is connected in parallel to this series combination. A manufacturing defect introduces a zero-resistance wire between node $X$ (the junction of $R_1$ and $R_2$) and node $Z$ (the midpoint of $R_3$), splitting $R_3$ into two equal resistors $R_{3a} = R_3/2$ and $R_{3b} = R_3/2$. Determine the equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$ between $A$ and $B$. Express $R_{\text{eq}}$ symbolically in terms of $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$.  

**Required Format:**  
Provide the final expression for $R_{\text{eq}}$ using the symbols $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$ exactly as defined. Simplify the expression algebraically. Do not substitute numerical values.

## Solution
**Step 1: Model the circuit topology**  
The modified circuit has five components:  
- $R_1$ between $A$ and $X$.  
- $R_2$ between $X$ and $B$.  
- $R_{3a} = R_3/2$ between $A$ and $Z$.  
- $R_{3b} = R_3/2$ between $Z$ and $B$.  
- A zero-resistance wire between $X$ and $Z$.  

**Step 2: Simplify using equipotential nodes**  
Since $X$ and $Z$ are shorted (zero resistance), they are at the same electrical potential. Thus, nodes $X$ and $Z$ merge into a single node, denoted $XZ$. The circuit simplifies to:  
- Parallel combination between $A$ and $XZ$: $R_1$ and $R_{3a}$.  
- Parallel combination between $XZ$ and $B$: $R_2$ and $R_{3b}$.  
- These two parallel combinations are in series between $A$ and $B$.  

**Step 3: Calculate resistance between $A$ and $XZ$**  
The equivalent resistance $R_{A-XZ}$ is the parallel combination of $R_1$ and $R_{3a}$:  
$$ R_{A-XZ} = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_{3a}}{R_1 + R_{3a}} = \frac{R_1 \cdot (R_3/2)}{R_1 + R_3/2} = \frac{R_1 R_3}{2R_1 + R_3}. $$  

**Step 4: Calculate resistance between $XZ$ and $B$**  
The equivalent resistance $R_{XZ-B}$ is the parallel combination of $R_2$ and $R_{3b}$:  
$$ R_{XZ-B} = \frac{R_2 \cdot R_{3b}}{R_2 + R_{3b}} = \frac{R_2 \cdot (R_3/2)}{R_2 + R_3/2} = \frac{R_2 R_3}{2R_2 + R_3}. $$  

**Step 5: Combine series resistances**  
The total equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$ is the sum of the series resistances:  
$$ R_{\text{eq}} = R_{A-XZ} + R_{XZ-B} = \frac{R_1 R_3}{2R_1 + R_3} + \frac{R_2 R_3}{2R_2 + R_3}. $$  

The expression is already simplified, as no further algebraic reduction is possible.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{R_{1} R_{3}}{2 R_{1} + R_{3}} + \dfrac{R_{2} R_{3}}{2 R_{2} + R_{3}}}$$

- **Touchscreen Grids**: Electrode arrays in capacitive touchscreens form similar networks.  
- **Nanoribbon Conductors**: Graphene-based materials exhibit square-lattice conductivity.  

### Problem Statement
Four identical resistors, each with resistance $R$, are connected to form a square circuit. The junctions are labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, where:  
- $A$ connects to $B$ and $D$,  
- $B$ connects to $A$ and $C$,  
- $C$ connects to $B$ and $D$,  
- $D$ connects to $A$ and $C$.

**Final Answer Format:**  
- Express your answer symbolically in terms of $R$.  
- Simplify the expression to a single fraction or integer multiple of $R$.  
- Enclose the final answer in \boxed{}.

## Solution
### Solution
To find the equivalent resistance $R_{\text{eq}}$ between nodes $A$ and $B$, we attach a voltage source $V$ across $A$ and $B$, setting $V_A = V$ and $V_B = 0$. Let $V_D$ and $V_C$ be the unknown voltages at nodes $D$ and $C$, respectively.  

#### Step 1: Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node $D$  
Currents flowing out of $D$:  
- To $A$: $\frac{V_D - V}{R}$ (from $D$ to $A$)  
- To $C$: $\frac{V_D - V_C}{R}$ (from $D$ to $C$)  
KCL states:  
$$
\frac{V_D - V}{R} + \frac{V_D - V_C}{R} = 0
$$  
Multiplying by $R$:  
$$
(V_D - V) + (V_D - V_C) = 0 \implies 2V_D - V_C = V \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
$$

#### Step 2: Apply KCL at node $C$  
Currents flowing out of $C$:  
- To $D$: $\frac{V_C - V_D}{R}$ (from $C$ to $D$)  
- To $B$: $\frac{V_C - 0}{R} = \frac{V_C}{R}$ (from $C$ to $B$)  
KCL states:  
$$
\frac{V_C - V_D}{R} + \frac{V_C}{R} = 0
$$  
Multiplying by $R$:  
$$
(V_C - V_D) + V_C = 0 \implies 2V_C - V_D = 0 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
$$

#### Step 3: Solve the system of equations  
From Equation 2:  
$$
V_D = 2V_C
$$  
Substitute into Equation 1:  
$$
2(2V_C) - V_C = V \implies 4V_C - V_C = V \implies 3V_C = V \implies V_C = \frac{V}{3}
$$  
Then:  
$$
V_D = 2 \left( \frac{V}{3} \right) = \frac{2V}{3}
$$

#### Step 4: Compute total current $I$ from the voltage source  
Current from $A$ to $B$:  
$$
I_{AB} = \frac{V_A - V_B}{R} = \frac{V - 0}{R} = \frac{V}{R}
$$  
Current from $A$ to $D$:  
$$
I_{AD} = \frac{V_A - V_D}{R} = \frac{V - \frac{2V}{3}}{R} = \frac{\frac{V}{3}}{R} = \frac{V}{3R}
$$  
Total current $I$ is the sum:  
$$
I = I_{AB} + I_{AD} = \frac{V}{R} + \frac{V}{3R} = \frac{3V}{3R} + \frac{V}{3R} = \frac{4V}{3R}
$$

#### Step 5: Calculate equivalent resistance  
$$
R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{V}{\frac{4V}{3R}} = \frac{3R}{4}
$$

# estimation and approximation methods

## Problem 0
**Background:**  
Raindrops form when water vapor condenses in the atmosphere, creating spherical droplets due to surface tension. The number of water molecules in a raindrop can be determined by modeling the drop as a sphere, using its volume, the density of water, and the molecular properties of water. This problem integrates geometry, unit conversion, and molecular stoichiometry to estimate a fundamental quantity in atmospheric science.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Volume of a sphere  
- Density and mass-volume relationships  
- Molar mass and Avogadro's number for molecular counting  
- Unit conversions (millimeters to meters)  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
Connects geometry (sphere volume) with chemistry (moles and Avogadro's number) and physics (density) within physical sciences.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Relevant to environmental science (rainfall modeling), engineering (fluid dynamics), and chemistry (stoichiometry in natural systems).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Estimating raindrop composition aids climate modeling, precipitation analysis, and pollution studies (e.g., aerosol scavenging by raindrops).  

**Problem Statement:**  
A raindrop has a diameter of 4 mm. Use the following values:  
- Density of water, $\rho = 1000  \text{kg/m}^3$  
- Molar mass of water, $M = 0.018  \text{kg/mol}$  
- Avogadro's number, $N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}  \text{mol}^{-1}$  

Derive a formula for the number of water molecules in the raindrop in terms of $\rho$, $M$, $N_A$, and the diameter $d$. Then, compute the numerical estimate.  
Express your final answer as a numerical value rounded to two significant digits.

## Solution
**Step 1: Convert diameter to meters**  
Given diameter $d = 4  \text{mm}$, convert to meters:  
$$ d = 4 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m} $$  

**Step 2: Calculate the radius**  
$$ r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-3}}{2} = 2 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m} $$  

**Step 3: Derive the volume of the spherical raindrop**  
The volume $V$ of a sphere is:  
$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 $$  
Substitute $r = d/2$:  
$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{d^3}{8} = \frac{\pi d^3}{6} $$  

**Step 4: Relate volume to mass using density**  
Mass $m$ is density times volume:  
$$ m = \rho V = \rho \cdot \frac{\pi d^3}{6} $$  

**Step 5: Calculate the number of moles**  
Number of moles $n$ is mass divided by molar mass:  
$$ n = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{\rho \pi d^3}{6M} $$  

**Step 6: Determine the number of molecules**  
Number of molecules $N$ is moles times Avogadro's number:  
$$ N = n \cdot N_A = \left( \frac{\rho \pi d^3}{6M} \right) N_A = \frac{\rho \pi d^3 N_A}{6M} $$  
This is the symbolic formula.  

**Numerical computation for final answer:**  
Substitute the given values:  
- $\rho = 1000  \text{kg/m}^3$  
- $d = 4 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m}$  
- $N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}$  
- $M = 0.018  \text{kg/mol}$  
- $\pi \approx 3.1416$  

$$ N = \frac{(1000) \cdot \pi \cdot (4 \times 10^{-3})^3 \cdot (6.022 \times 10^{23})}{6 \cdot 0.018} $$  

Compute step by step:  
1. $(4 \times 10^{-3})^3 = 64 \times 10^{-9} = 6.4 \times 10^{-8}$  
2. $\rho \cdot d^3 = 1000 \cdot 6.4 \times 10^{-8} = 6.4 \times 10^{-5}$  
3. $\rho d^3 \pi = 6.4 \times 10^{-5} \cdot \pi \approx 6.4 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 3.1416 = 2.01024 \times 10^{-4}$  
4. $\rho d^3 \pi N_A = 2.01024 \times 10^{-4} \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 1.211 \times 10^{20}$  
5. Denominator: $6M = 6 \cdot 0.018 = 0.108$  
6. $N = \frac{1.211 \times 10^{20}}{0.108} \approx 1.121 \times 10^{21}$  

Round to two significant digits:  
$$ N \approx 1.1 \times 10^{21} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{1.1 \times 10^{21}}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
Kinetic energy represents the energy an object possesses due to its motion and is fundamental in physics, sports science, and engineering. For an object of mass $m$ moving at speed $v$, the kinetic energy $E_k$ is given by $E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$. In real-world scenarios, precise measurements may not be available, requiring estimation techniques. This problem explores how to approximate kinetic energy using given observational data and highlights the importance of significant figures in reporting results.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Application of the kinetic energy formula $E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$.
2. Calculation of constant speed from distance and time.
3. Numerical approximation and rounding based on significant figures.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects kinematics (speed calculation) with energy concepts in mechanics.
- Reinforces unit consistency (meters, seconds, kilograms, joules) in physics equations.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Sports Science: Estimating energy expenditure helps optimize athletic training and nutrition.
- Mathematics: Significant figures reflect measurement precision in quantitative analysis.

Real-World Applications:
- Engineers use kinetic energy estimates to design safety equipment (e.g., crash barriers).
- Physiologists calculate energy demands for athletes during competitions to tailor dietary plans.

Problem Statement:
A runner completes a 400-meter race in 80 seconds. The runner's mass is approximately 70 kg. Assuming constant speed throughout the race, estimate the kinetic energy in joules. Round your final answer to two significant digits.  
**Express your answer as a numerical value only (without units).**

## Solution
**Step 1: Calculate the runner's speed**  
The runner covers a distance of 400 meters in 80 seconds. Since the speed is constant:  

$$
v = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{400}{80} = 5.0  \text{m/s}.
$$


**Step 2: Apply the kinetic energy formula**  
The kinetic energy is given by:  

$$
E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2.
$$
  
Substitute $m = 70$ kg and $v = 5.0$ m/s:  

$$
E_k = \frac{1}{2} \times 70 \times (5.0)^2.
$$


**Step 3: Compute the value**  
First, calculate $v^2$:  

$$
(5.0)^2 = 25.0.
$$
  
Then:  

$$
E_k = \frac{1}{2} \times 70 \times 25.0 = 35 \times 25.0 = 875  \text{J}.
$$


**Step 4: Round to two significant digits**  
The value 875 has three significant digits. Rounding to two significant digits:  
- The third digit (5) requires rounding up the second digit (7) to 8.  
- Thus, 875 rounds to 880.  

The estimated kinetic energy is **880 joules**.

## Answer
$$\boxed{880}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field. For an object near Earth's surface, this energy is given by $ U = mgh $, where $ m $ is mass, $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $ h $ is the vertical height above a reference point. Stair climbing involves converting metabolic energy into gravitational potential energy. 

A flight of stairs typically connects two consecutive floors in a building. The vertical height per flight ($ h_{\text{flight}} $) depends on architectural standards, which vary globally. For estimation, we use a representative value derived from common floor-to-ceiling heights and step riser dimensions.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Gravitational potential energy formula derivation
- Height estimation for multi-flight staircases
- Unit consistency and dimensional analysis
- Multiplication of physical quantities

Intradisciplinary Connections:
Connects to kinematics (displacement/work) and energy conservation. The potential energy change equals the minimum work required against gravity, linking to mechanical work principles.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Architecture: Standard stair riser heights (typically 15-20 cm) and floor heights (3-4 m) influence building design.
- Physiology: Energy expenditure in stair climbing relates to biomechanics and metabolic efficiency.

Real-World Applications:
- Calculating energy savings in vertical transportation (e.g., elevators vs. stairs)
- Estimating calorie burn in fitness trackers
- Structural engineering load calculations

Problem:
A student of mass $ m = 50  \text{kg} $ climbs $ k = 3 $ flights of stairs. Assume each flight has a vertical height of $ h_{\text{flight}} = 3.0  \text{m} $. Derive an expression for the gravitational potential energy gained ($ \Delta U $) in terms of $ m $, $ g $, $ k $, and $ h_{\text{flight}} $. Then compute the numerical value using $ g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2 $. 

Round your final answer to two significant figures. Express the numerical result without units.

## Solution
The gravitational potential energy gained is:

$$
\Delta U = mg \Delta h
$$

where $ \Delta h $ is the total vertical height climbed. For $ k $ flights:

$$
\Delta h = k \cdot h_{\text{flight}}
$$

Substituting:

$$
\Delta U = m g (k \cdot h_{\text{flight}})
$$

Now insert values:
- $ m = 50  \text{kg} $
- $ g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2 $
- $ k = 3 $
- $ h_{\text{flight}} = 3.0  \text{m} $

First, compute total height:

$$
\Delta h = 3 \times 3.0 = 9.0  \text{m}
$$

Then calculate energy:

$$
\Delta U = 50 \times 9.8 \times 9.0
$$

Break down multiplication:

$$
50 \times 9.8 = 490
$$


$$
490 \times 9.0 = 4410  \text{J}
$$

Rounding to two significant figures:
- 4410 rounds to 4400 (since 4410 ≈ 4.41 × 10³; the third digit '1' < 5, so it becomes 4.4 × 10³ = 4400).

The gravitational potential energy gained is 4400 joules.

## Answer
$$\boxed{4400}$$

## Problem 3
Background:
Air resistance, or drag, is a force that opposes the motion of an object through a fluid like air. The magnitude of this force depends on the object's speed, shape, and size, as well as the fluid's density. The drag force $F_d$ is modeled by:
$$ F_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A $$
where:
- $\rho$ is the air density,
- $v$ is the object's speed relative to the fluid,
- $C_d$ is the drag coefficient (dimensionless, depending on shape),
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area perpendicular to motion.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Application of the drag force equation.
2. Unit conversion (speed from km/h to m/s).
3. Simplification of expressions using given parameters.
4. Estimation using typical physical values.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects to Newton's laws of motion (force-velocity relationships) and fluid dynamics (drag in ideal fluids).
- Relates to energy conservation, as drag converts kinetic energy to thermal energy.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Engineering: Drag reduction is critical in vehicle design (e.g., bicycles, cars) for efficiency.
- Environmental Science: Air resistance affects fuel consumption and emissions in transportation.
- Sports Science: Cyclists optimize posture and equipment to minimize drag.

Real-World Applications:
- Bicycle manufacturers use drag coefficients to design aerodynamic frames and helmets.
- Urban planners estimate cycling effort for infrastructure design.
- Athletes analyze drag to improve performance in races.

Typical Values for Estimation:
- Air density $\rho = \frac{6}{5}  \text{kg/m}^3$ (at sea level, ~20°C).
- Drag coefficient $C_d = \frac{9}{10}$ (typical for upright bicycle with rider).
- Cross-sectional area $A = \frac{1}{2}  \text{m}^2$ (average for rider and bicycle).

Problem:
A bicycle moves at $15  \text{km/h}$ through still air. Using the drag force equation and the typical values above, estimate the air resistance force in newtons.  
- Convert the speed to m/s.
- Derive the force step by step, keeping all constants symbolic until the final numerical evaluation.
- Express the final answer as a decimal rounded to two decimal places.

Final Answer Requirement:
- Box the numerical value only (without units).
- Ensure all calculations use exact fractions for intermediate steps.

## Solution
**Step 1: Convert speed to m/s**  
Given speed: $v = 15  \text{km/h}$.  
Convert using $1  \text{km} = 1000  \text{m}$ and $1  \text{h} = 3600  \text{s}$:  
$$ v = 15 \times \frac{1000}{3600} = 15 \times \frac{5}{18} = \frac{75}{18} = \frac{25}{6}  \text{m/s} $$

**Step 2: Write the drag force equation**  
$$ F_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A $$

**Step 3: Substitute typical values**  
- $\rho = \frac{6}{5}  \text{kg/m}^3$  
- $C_d = \frac{9}{10}$  
- $A = \frac{1}{2}  \text{m}^2$  
- $v = \frac{25}{6}  \text{m/s}$  
First, compute $v^2$:  
$$ v^2 = \left( \frac{25}{6} \right)^2 = \frac{625}{36} $$  
Now substitute:  
$$ F_d = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{6}{5} \times \frac{625}{36} \times \frac{9}{10} \times \frac{1}{2} $$

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
Group numerators and denominators:  
$$ F_d = \frac{1 \times 6 \times 625 \times 9 \times 1}{2 \times 5 \times 36 \times 10 \times 2} $$  
Factorize:  
- Numerator: $6 \times 625 \times 9 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^4 \times 3^2 = 2 \times 3^3 \times 5^4$  
- Denominator: $2 \times 5 \times 36 \times 10 \times 2 = 2 \times 5 \times (2^2 \times 3^2) \times (2 \times 5) \times 2 = 2^5 \times 3^2 \times 5^2$  
Simplify:  
$$ F_d = \frac{2 \times 3^3 \times 5^4}{2^5 \times 3^2 \times 5^2} = 3^{3-2} \times 5^{4-2} \times 2^{1-5} = 3 \times 25 \times 2^{-4} = \frac{75}{16} $$  
Exact force: $F_d = \frac{75}{16}  \text{N}$.

**Step 5: Convert to decimal and round**  
$$ \frac{75}{16} = 4.6875 $$  
Rounded to two decimal places: $4.69$.

The estimated air resistance force is $4.69  \text{N}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{4.69}$$

**Background**  
Pressure is a fundamental concept in physics, defined as the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area. In biomechanics, estimating the pressure exerted by large animals like elephants helps us understand weight distribution, anatomical adaptations, and their interaction with terrain. Elephants distribute their massive weight across four feet, each with a roughly circular contact area. This problem explores how to model and compute this pressure using estimation techniques.

**Problem Statement**  
An adult African elephant has a typical mass of $m = 4000  \text{kg}$. It stands uniformly on four feet, each with a circular cross-section of diameter $d = 40  \text{cm}$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$.  

Derive an expression for the pressure $P$ exerted by a single foot on the ground. Then, compute the numerical value of $P$ in pascals (Pa).  

**Requirements**:  
- Express $P$ symbolically in terms of $m$, $g$, and $d$.  
- For the numerical result, use $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$.  
- Convert all units to SI base units before calculation.  
- Report the final numerical answer in scientific notation rounded to **two significant digits**.  
- Provide only the numerical value in the final answer (omit units).

## Solution
### Step 1: Express force on one foot  
The total weight of the elephant is the gravitational force:  
$$F_{\text{total}} = m g$$  
This weight is evenly distributed across four feet, so the force $F$ on one foot is:  
$$F = \frac{F_{\text{total}}}{4} = \frac{m g}{4}$$  

### Step 2: Calculate the area of one foot  
The diameter of a foot is $d = 40  \text{cm}$. Convert to meters:  
$$d = 40  \text{cm} \times \frac{1  \text{m}}{100  \text{cm}} = 0.4  \text{m}$$  
The radius $r$ is half the diameter:  
$$r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2  \text{m}$$  
The contact area $A$ of one (circular) foot is:  
$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.2)^2 = 0.04\pi  \text{m}^2$$  

### Step 3: Derive pressure symbolically  
Pressure $P$ is force per unit area:  
$$P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{\frac{m g}{4}}{\pi r^2}$$  
Substitute $r = d/2$:  
$$P = \frac{m g}{4 \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{m g}{4 \pi \cdot \frac{d^2}{4}} = \frac{m g}{\pi d^2}$$  
The symbolic expression for pressure is:  
$$P = \frac{m g}{\pi d^2}$$  

### Step 4: Compute numerical value  
Substitute the given values:  
- $m = 4000  \text{kg}$  
- $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$  
- $d = 0.4  \text{m}$  
- $\pi \approx 3.1416$  

$$P = \frac{(4000)(9.8)}{\pi (0.4)^2} = \frac{39200}{\pi \cdot 0.16} = \frac{39200}{0.5026544} \approx 77986.5  \text{Pa}$$  
Round to two significant digits:  
$$P \approx 7.8 \times 10^4  \text{Pa}$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{7.8 \times 10^{4}}$$

## Problem 5
**Background**: Wind energy is a vital renewable resource, converting the kinetic energy of moving air into electrical power through turbines. The power generated depends on the wind's kinetic energy flux through the turbine's swept area and the turbine's efficiency in converting this mechanical energy to electricity. Efficiency, denoted as $\eta$, represents the fraction of wind power captured (e.g., $\eta = 30\%$ means 30% of the available wind power is converted to electricity).  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. Kinetic energy flux in fluids.  
2. Power derivation from mass flow rate and energy conservation.  
3. Efficiency in energy conversion systems.  
4. Geometric area calculations (circular swept area).  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
- Connects fluid dynamics (kinetic energy in wind) with mechanical energy conversion and electrical power generation.  
- Reinforces the relationship between power, force, and velocity from Newtonian mechanics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
- **Environmental Science**: Wind farms reduce carbon emissions by displacing fossil fuels.  
- **Engineering**: Turbine design involves aerodynamic blade profiles and generator efficiency optimization.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
- Large-scale wind farms (e.g., Gansu Wind Farm, China) supply grid electricity.  
- Offshore turbines harness consistent ocean winds for higher output.  

**Problem**:  
A wind farm has $N$ identical turbines. Each turbine has rotor blades of radius $R$, operates at an efficiency $\eta$, and experiences a uniform wind speed $v$. The air density is $\rho$. Derive an expression for the total electrical power output $P_{\text{total}}$ of the wind farm. Express $P_{\text{total}}$ in terms of $N$, $\eta$, $\rho$, $R$, and $v$.  

**Final Answer Format**:  
- Use $\pi$ for the circle constant.  
- Express fractions with $\frac{}{}$.  
- Use $R^{2}$ for $R$ squared.  
- Do not substitute numerical values for any parameters.

## Solution
**Step 1: Wind power through one turbine’s swept area**  
The kinetic energy of wind passing through the swept area per unit time (power) is:  
$$ P_{\text{wind}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{mass flow rate} \times v^{2} $$  

**Step 2: Mass flow rate derivation**  
- Swept area of one turbine: $A = \pi R^{2}$ (circular area).  
- Volume of air passing through $A$ per unit time: $\text{volume flow rate} = A v = \pi R^{2} v$.  
- Mass flow rate: $\dot{m} = \rho \times \text{volume flow rate} = \rho \pi R^{2} v$.  

**Step 3: Power in the wind for one turbine**  
Substitute $\dot{m}$ into the kinetic energy formula:  
$$ P_{\text{wind}} = \frac{1}{2} (\rho \pi R^{2} v) v^{2} = \frac{1}{2} \rho \pi R^{2} v^{3} $$  

**Step 4: Electrical power output per turbine**  
Efficiency $\eta$ gives the electrical power per turbine:  
$$ P_{\text{turbine}} = \eta \times P_{\text{wind}} = \eta \cdot \frac{1}{2} \rho \pi R^{2} v^{3} $$  

**Step 5: Total power for the wind farm**  
With $N$ identical turbines:  
$$ P_{\text{total}} = N \times P_{\text{turbine}} = N \cdot \eta \cdot \frac{1}{2} \rho \pi R^{2} v^{3} $$  

**Final expression**:  
$$ P_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} N \eta \rho \pi R^{2} v^{3} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2} N \eta \rho \pi R^{2} v^{3}}$$

# friction force direction determination

## Problem 0
**Background:**  
Consider a block of mass $m$ resting on a horizontal surface. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the surface is $\mu_s$. A force $\vec{F}$ is applied to the block at an angle $\theta$ *below* the horizontal, as shown in the figure below (imagine a rope pulling the block to the right and downward). The magnitude of $\vec{F}$ is sufficient to make the block *impend motion* (i.e., it is on the verge of sliding to the right).  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Newton's second law for static equilibrium (sum of forces $= 0$).  
- Force decomposition into orthogonal components.  
- Static friction: its maximum magnitude ($\mu_s N$) and its direction (opposes impending motion).  
- Normal force adjustment due to applied forces.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem connects to dynamics (Newton's laws), friction theory, and vector resolution. It reinforces understanding that friction is a reaction force dependent on contact interactions and sets the stage for analyzing inclined planes, braking systems, and stability.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Engineering:** Calculating forces in structural design (e.g., cranes, conveyor belts).  
- **Biomechanics:** Understanding joint friction or muscle-driven motion (e.g., pulling objects at angles).  
- **Materials Science:** Relating $\mu_s$ to surface properties.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- **Towing vehicles:** A tow truck cable pulls downward and forward; friction determines if the vehicle moves.  
- **Sports science:** Athletes pulling sleds with angled ropes to optimize force application.  
- **Ergonomics:** Minimizing effort when moving heavy objects by adjusting pull angles.  

**Problem:**  
Derive the minimum magnitude of the force $F_{\text{min}}$ that must be applied at the angle $\theta$ (below the horizontal) to initiate sliding. Express $F_{\text{min}}$ in terms of $m$, $g$, $\mu_s$, and $\theta$.  
*Format requirements:*  
- Use $\mu_s$ for the coefficient of static friction.  
- Use $\theta$ for the angle below the horizontal.  
- Express the answer as a single fraction.  
- Do not substitute numerical values; keep all terms symbolic.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the coordinate system and forces**  
- Set up a coordinate system: $x$-axis horizontal (positive to the right), $y$-axis vertical (positive upward).  
- Forces acting on the block:  
  - Weight: $\vec{W} = -mg \, \hat{\mathbf{j}}$ (downward).  
  - Applied force: $\vec{F} = F \cos\theta \, \hat{\mathbf{i}} - F \sin\theta \, \hat{\mathbf{j}}$ (right and downward).  
  - Normal force: $\vec{N} = N \, \hat{\mathbf{j}}$ (upward).  
  - Static friction: $\vec{f_s} = -f_s \, \hat{\mathbf{i}}$ (opposes impending motion; since motion impends right, friction acts left).  

**Step 2: Apply Newton's second law for static equilibrium**  
The block is in equilibrium (impending motion but no acceleration), so:  
- Sum of forces in $x$-direction:  
  $$ F \cos\theta - f_s = 0 \quad (1) $$  
- Sum of forces in $y$-direction:  
  $$ N - mg - F \sin\theta = 0 \quad (2) $$  

**Step 3: Incorporate maximum static friction**  
At impending motion, friction is maximal:  
$$ f_s = \mu_s N \quad (3) $$  

**Step 4: Solve for $N$ and $f_s$**  
From equation (2):  
$$ N = mg + F \sin\theta \quad (4) $$  
Substitute (4) into (3):  
$$ f_s = \mu_s (mg + F \sin\theta) \quad (5) $$  

**Step 5: Substitute (5) into equilibrium equation (1)**  
$$ F \cos\theta - \mu_s (mg + F \sin\theta) = 0 $$  
Solve for $F$:  
$$ F \cos\theta = \mu_s mg + \mu_s F \sin\theta $$  
$$ F \cos\theta - \mu_s F \sin\theta = \mu_s mg $$  
$$ F (\cos\theta - \mu_s \sin\theta) = \mu_s mg $$  
$$ F = \frac{\mu_s mg}{\cos\theta - \mu_s \sin\theta} $$  
This is the force $F$ required to initiate motion. The *minimum* such force is:  
$$ F_{\text{min}} = \frac{\mu_s mg}{\cos\theta - \mu_s \sin\theta} $$  
**Note:** For this expression to be physically meaningful, $\cos\theta > \mu_s \sin\theta$ (otherwise, motion cannot be initiated by pulling below horizontal).  

**Final Answer Format:**  
The minimum force is $\boxed{\dfrac{\mu_s m g}{\cos\theta - \mu_s \sin\theta}}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\mu_s m g}{\cos\theta - \mu_s \sin\theta}}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
Conveyor belts are essential in industries for transporting goods. When an object is placed on a moving belt, friction determines whether the object accelerates, decelerates, or moves uniformly. Kinetic friction arises when there is relative motion between the object and the belt. This problem explores how to determine the direction of kinetic friction on a crate when the conveyor belt moves leftward, while the crate has an arbitrary initial horizontal velocity.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. **Kinetic friction direction**: The force opposes relative motion between surfaces.  
2. **Relative velocity**: Calculation of an object's velocity relative to another moving surface.  
3. **Newtonian mechanics**: Application of friction laws and vector decomposition.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates kinematics (relative motion) with dynamics (friction forces) under Newton's second law. It reinforces the concept that friction direction depends on relative motion, not absolute motion.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Friction direction analysis is critical in mechanical engineering (e.g., conveyor system design) and robotics (gripping mechanisms). It also relates to fluid dynamics (drag forces opposing relative flow).  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Baggage handling in airports: Friction adjusts luggage speed to match conveyor velocity.  
- Manufacturing lines: Controlling object slip on assembly belts prevents damage.  
- Mining industry: Efficient transport of ores relies on friction management.  

**Problem Statement**  
A conveyor belt moves horizontally to the left with constant speed $v_b$ ($v_b > 0$). A crate of mass $m$ is dropped onto the belt. At the initial moment of contact, the crate has a horizontal velocity component $v_c$ (positive if directed right, negative if left). The coefficient of kinetic friction is $\mu_k$, and slipping occurs ($v_{\text{rel}} \neq 0$). Gravity is $g$, and no other forces act horizontally.  

Derive the horizontal component of the kinetic friction force $\vec{f}_k$ acting on the crate at the initial moment. Use a coordinate system where **right is positive**.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $m$, $g$, $\mu_k$, $v_b$, and $v_c$. Use:  
- `\frac{a}{b}` for fractions.  
- `|x|` for absolute value of $x$.  
- The expression $\frac{x}{|x|}$ for the sign of $x$ ($x \neq 0$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Define velocities in the coordinate system**  
- Assign right as the positive direction.  
- Belt velocity: $\vec{v}_b = -v_b \hat{\imath}$ (leftward).  
- Crate velocity: $\vec{v}_c = v_c \hat{\imath}$ (arbitrary).  

**Step 2: Compute relative velocity of crate w.r.t. belt**  
Relative velocity $\vec{v}_{\text{rel}}$ is the difference between the crate's velocity and the belt's velocity:  
$$ \vec{v}_{\text{rel}} = \vec{v}_c - \vec{v}_b = v_c \hat{\imath} - (-v_b \hat{\imath}) = (v_c + v_b) \hat{\imath}. $$  
The scalar component is $v_{\text{rel}} = v_c + v_b$.  

**Step 3: Determine direction of kinetic friction**  
- Kinetic friction opposes the relative motion. Thus, the force on the crate is opposite to $\vec{v}_{\text{rel}}$.  
- The horizontal component $f_k$ satisfies:  
  $$ \text{sign}(f_k) = -\text{sign}(v_{\text{rel}}). $$  

**Step 4: Magnitude of kinetic friction**  
The magnitude $|\vec{f}_k|$ is given by:  
$$ |\vec{f}_k| = \mu_k N, $$  
where $N$ is the normal force. With no vertical acceleration, $N = mg$. Thus:  
$$ |\vec{f}_k| = \mu_k m g. $$  

**Step 5: Combine direction and magnitude**  
- The horizontal component is:  
  $$ f_k = - \left( \frac{v_{\text{rel}}}{|v_{\text{rel}}|} \right) \mu_k m g. $$  
- Substitute $v_{\text{rel}} = v_c + v_b$:  
  $$ f_k = - \mu_k m g \frac{v_c + v_b}{|v_c + v_b|}. $$

## Answer
$$ \boxed{ -\mu_k m g \frac{v_c + v_b}{\left|v_c + v_b\right|} } $$

## Problem 2
### Background
In transportation systems, such as trucks carrying stacked cargo, friction plays a critical role in preventing objects from sliding during acceleration. Consider a scenario where two boxes are stacked on a frictionless cart. When the cart accelerates, friction between the boxes ensures they move together without slipping. Understanding the direction and magnitude of this friction force is essential for designing stable cargo systems.

### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Newton’s Second Law**: Relates net force to acceleration for systems and individual objects.
2. **Static Friction**: Acts to prevent relative motion between surfaces in contact.
3. **Newton’s Third Law**: Friction forces between two objects are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
4. **Relative Motion Analysis**: Determines the direction of friction based on the tendency of slipping.

### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to dynamics (Newton’s laws), friction applications in mechanics, and force analysis in constrained systems. It extends to topics like critical acceleration thresholds and maximum static friction limits.

### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Designing cargo restraints, conveyor belts, and vehicle safety systems.
- **Materials Science**: Selecting materials with appropriate coefficients of friction for stacking applications.
- **Transportation Logistics**: Securing loads to prevent shifting during transit.

### Real-World Applications
- **Cargo Trucks**: Friction prevents unsecured boxes from sliding off during acceleration.
- **Conveyor Belts**: Items on inclined or accelerating belts rely on friction to maintain position.
- **Aircraft Takeoff**: Overhead luggage must not slide due to acceleration forces; friction is critical.

### Problem Statement
Two blocks, A and B, are stacked on a frictionless horizontal surface. Block A (mass $m_A$) rests on top of block B (mass $m_B$). A horizontal force $\vec{F}$ is applied to block A in the positive $x$-direction (to the right), causing the system to accelerate. The blocks move together without slipping. Determine the $x$-component of the friction force exerted by block B on block A.  

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $m_A$, $m_B$, and $F$. Use a coordinate system where the positive $x$-direction is to the right.

## Solution
### Step 1: Analyze the entire system
The only external horizontal force acting on the system (blocks A + B) is $\vec{F}$ applied to block A. The surface is frictionless, so no other horizontal forces act on the system. Applying Newton’s second law to the combined mass:  
$$ F = (m_A + m_B) a $$  
where $a$ is the acceleration of the system. Solving for $a$:  
$$ a = \frac{F}{m_A + m_B} $$  
The acceleration $a$ is constant and directed to the right for both blocks since they move together.

### Step 2: Isolate block A
Forces acting on block A in the $x$-direction:  
- Applied force: $\vec{F}$ (positive $x$-direction).  
- Friction force from block B: $\vec{f}_{\text{B on A}}$ (direction unknown).  

By Newton’s second law for block A:  
$$ F + f_{\text{B on A}, x} = m_A a $$  
where $f_{\text{B on A}, x}$ is the $x$-component of the friction force exerted by B on A.

### Step 3: Substitute acceleration
Substitute $a = \frac{F}{m_A + m_B}$ into the equation for block A:  
$$ F + f_{\text{B on A}, x} = m_A \left( \frac{F}{m_A + m_B} \right) $$  

### Step 4: Solve for $f_{\text{B on A}, x}$
Rearrange the equation:  
$$ f_{\text{B on A}, x} = m_A \left( \frac{F}{m_A + m_B} \right) - F $$  
Factor out $F$:  
$$ f_{\text{B on A}, x} = F \left( \frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B} - 1 \right) $$  
Combine the terms inside the parentheses:  
$$ \frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B} - 1 = \frac{m_A - (m_A + m_B)}{m_A + m_B} = \frac{-m_B}{m_A + m_B} $$  
Thus:  
$$ f_{\text{B on A}, x} = F \left( \frac{-m_B}{m_A + m_B} \right) = -\left( \frac{m_B F}{m_A + m_B} \right) $$  

### Step 5: Interpret the direction
The negative sign indicates that the friction force on block A acts in the negative $x$-direction (to the left). This makes sense because without friction, block A would accelerate faster than block B due to the direct application of $\vec{F}$. Friction opposes this relative motion by pulling block A backward (left) relative to block B.

### Summary
The $x$-component of the friction force exerted by block B on block A is $-\frac{m_B F}{m_A + m_B}$. The magnitude is $\frac{m_B F}{m_A + m_B}$, and the direction is opposite to the applied force (to the left).

## Answer
$$\boxed{-\dfrac{m_B F}{m_A + m_B}}$$

## Problem 3
**Background**  
When a car turns on a flat road, static friction between the tires and the road provides the centripetal force necessary for circular motion. Unlike kinetic friction, static friction can adjust its direction to prevent slipping, acting perpendicular to the tire's velocity toward the center of the turn. This problem explores how the direction of static friction differs between the front and rear tires during a left turn, highlighting the role of tire orientation and force distribution.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. **Static friction direction**: How friction opposes relative motion at the point of contact.  
2. **Centripetal force**: The net force required for circular motion, provided by friction here.  
3. **Rigid-body motion**: How different parts of a car (front/rear tires) contribute to overall turning.  
4. **Vector decomposition**: Resolving friction forces into longitudinal (forward/backward) and lateral (left/right) components.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
- Relates to Newton's laws (force and motion) and circular dynamics (centripetal acceleration).  
- Connects to torque and rotational motion when considering steering mechanics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Engineering**: Vehicle dynamics in automotive design (e.g., traction control systems).  
- **Sports science**: Analogy to athletes pivoting (e.g., basketball turns) where friction enables direction changes.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Vehicle safety**: Understanding friction direction helps design anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and stability control.  
- **Daily driving**: Explains why tires squeal during sharp turns (friction limits) and how understeer/oversteer occurs.  

---

**Problem Statement**  
A car of mass $m$ turns left at constant speed $v$ on a flat road, following a circular path of radius $R$. The front tires are steered left at an angle $\theta$ relative to the car's longitudinal axis (direction of initial motion), while the rear tires remain unsteered (aligned with the longitudinal axis). Assume:  
- The road supplies static friction to all tires.  
- The car maintains constant speed (no acceleration/deceleration).  
- Gravitational acceleration is $g$, and the center of mass is equidistant from all tires.  

Derive expressions for the direction of the static friction force on:  
1. A rear tire.  
2. A front tire.  

Express each direction as the angle $\phi$ (in radians) that the friction force makes with the car's longitudinal axis. Use the coordinate system where:  
- $+x$ = forward direction (longitudinal axis).  
- $+y$ = leftward direction (lateral axis).  

**Required Format**  
- For each tire, provide $\phi$ as an exact expression in terms of $v$, $R$, $\theta$, and/or mathematical constants.  
- Use $\arctan$ for inverse tangent (e.g., $\arctan(a/b)$), not $\tan^{-1}$.  
- Angles must be in radians.  
- **Final answers must be boxed separately for the rear and front tires.**

## Solution
**Step 1: Direction for a rear tire**  
The rear tires are unsteered, so their velocity vector $\vec{v}$ is purely in the $+x$ direction. For circular motion, the centripetal acceleration $a_c = v^2 / R$ is directed leftward ($+y$). Static friction must provide this acceleration, so the friction force on a rear tire $\vec{f}_{\text{rear}}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{v}$ and toward the center of the turn. Thus:  
- $\vec{f}_{\text{rear}}$ has no $x$-component (no longitudinal force since speed is constant).  
- $\vec{f}_{\text{rear}}$ acts entirely in the $+y$ direction.  

The angle $\phi_{\text{rear}}$ with the longitudinal axis ($+x$) is:  

$$
\phi_{\text{rear}} = \arctan\left(\frac{f_y}{f_x}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{\text{magnitude}}{0}\right).
$$
  
Since $f_x = 0$ and $f_y > 0$, $\phi_{\text{rear}} = \pi/2$ radians.  

**Step 2: Direction for a front tire**  
The front tires are steered at angle $\theta$ to the longitudinal axis. Their velocity $\vec{v}_{\text{front}}$ is tangent to the circular path, but at the instant of turning, it has:  
- A longitudinal component $v_x = v \cos\theta$ (forward).  
- A lateral component $v_y = v \sin\theta$ (leftward).  

Static friction opposes impending slip. The tire "wants" to slip outward (rightward, $-y$) due to inertia, so friction acts leftward ($+y$) to provide centripetal force. However, because the tire is turned, friction also has a longitudinal component to maintain constant speed:  
- A lateral component $f_y$ provides centripetal force.  
- A longitudinal component $f_x$ balances engine/drag forces to keep speed constant.  

For constant speed, net force longitudinal force must be zero. The lateral friction component is $f \cos\theta$ (parallel to the tire's plane), and the longitudinal component is $f \sin\theta$ (perpendicular to the tire's plane), where $f$ is the friction magnitude. Resolving into $x/y$-coordinates:  

$$
f_x = -f \sin\theta \quad (\text{negative } x \text{ since it opposes motion when turned}),  
$$
  

$$
f_y = f \cos\theta \quad (\text{positive } y \text{ for centripetal force}).  
$$
  
The angle $\phi_{\text{front}}$ with the $+x$-axis is:  

$$
\phi_{\text{front}} = \arctan\left(\frac{f_y}{f_x}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{f \cos\theta}{-f \sin\theta}\right) = \arctan\left(-\cot\theta\right).  
$$
  
Since $\cot\theta = 1/\tan\theta$, and the force is in the second quadrant ($f_x < 0$, $f_y > 0$):  

$$
\phi_{\text{front}} = \pi + \arctan\left(-\cot\theta\right) = \pi - \arctan\left(\cot\theta\right).  
$$
  
Using $\arctan(\cot\theta) = \arctan(\tan(\pi/2 - \theta)) = \pi/2 - \theta$:  

$$
\phi_{\text{front}} = \pi - \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} + \theta.

# gravitational potential energy in space

## Problem 0
**Background**  
In orbital mechanics, understanding the energy of satellites is crucial for mission design and trajectory planning. The gravitational potential energy of a satellite depends on its position relative to Earth and is derived from fundamental principles of gravitation. This problem explores how to determine this energy using measurable orbital parameters.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Newton's law of universal gravitation.  
2. Centripetal force requirement for circular orbits.  
3. Relationship between orbital period, radius, and speed.  
4. Gravitational potential energy definition.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
- Connects kinematics (circular motion) with conservation laws (energy) in classical mechanics.  
- Extends gravitational concepts to orbital dynamics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- Aerospace engineering: Satellite deployment and orbital stability calculations.  
- Geophysics: Modeling gravitational fields for celestial bodies.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Calculating energy requirements for satellite orbit adjustments (e.g., GPS satellites, Earth observation).  
- Mission planning for interplanetary probes using gravitational slingshots.  

**Problem Statement**  
A satellite of mass $m$ is in a circular orbit around Earth (mass $M$) with an orbital period $T$. Derive an expression for the gravitational potential energy $U$ of the satellite. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $M$, $T$, $G$ (gravitational constant), and $\pi$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Equate gravitational force to centripetal force**  
For a circular orbit, gravity provides the centripetal force:  
$$\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}$$  
where $r$ is the orbital radius and $v$ is the orbital speed. Simplify by canceling $m$ and $r$:  
$$\frac{G M}{r} = v^2 \quad (1)$$  

**Step 2: Relate orbital speed to period**  
The orbital speed $v$ is the circumference divided by the period $T$:  
$$v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T} \quad (2)$$  

**Step 3: Substitute $v$ into Equation (1)**  
Substitute Equation (2) into Equation (1):  
$$\frac{G M}{r} = \left( \frac{2 \pi r}{T} \right)^2$$  
Simplify:  
$$\frac{G M}{r} = \frac{4 \pi^2 r^2}{T^2}$$  
Multiply both sides by $r T^2$:  
$$G M T^2 = 4 \pi^2 r^3$$  
Solve for $r^3$:  
$$r^3 = \frac{G M T^2}{4 \pi^2} \quad (3)$$  

**Step 4: Express gravitational potential energy**  
The gravitational potential energy is:  
$$U = -\frac{G M m}{r} \quad (4)$$  
Rewrite $r$ from Equation (3):  
$$r = \left( \frac{G M T^2}{4 \pi^2} \right)^{1/3}$$  

**Step 5: Substitute $r$ into Equation (4)**  
$$U = -\frac{G M m}{\left( \frac{G M T^2}{4 \pi^2} \right)^{1/3}} = -G M m \left( \frac{4 \pi^2}{G M T^2} \right)^{1/3}$$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$U = -m (G M)^{2/3} \left( \frac{4 \pi^2}{T^2} \right)^{1/3} = -m \left( \frac{4 \pi^2 G^2 M^2}{T^2} \right)^{1/3}$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{-m\left(\frac{4\pi^{2}G^{2}M^{2}}{T^{2}}\right)^{1/3}}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**:

In space exploration, the escape velocity is the minimum speed required for an object to break free from the gravitational attraction of a celestial body without further propulsion. For Mars, this velocity depends on its mass and radius. 

The universal law of gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting the two points. The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The constant of proportionality is the universal gravitational constant, denoted by $G$. 

The gravitational potential energy of an object of mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the center of a planet of mass $M$ is given by:
$$ U = - \frac{G M m}{r} $$
assuming the potential energy is zero at infinity.

To escape the planet, an object must have enough kinetic energy to overcome this potential energy. Specifically, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) at the moment of launch must be at least zero for the object to reach infinity with zero speed.

**Knowledge Points Tested**:
- Conservation of mechanical energy in a gravitational field.
- Definition and calculation of escape velocity.
- Application of the gravitational potential energy formula.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:
This problem connects to the study of celestial mechanics and orbital dynamics, which are key topics in physics. It also relates to the concept of gravitational fields and energy conservation.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:
The escape velocity is a critical parameter in aerospace engineering for designing spacecraft and mission profiles. It is also important in astronomy for understanding the evolution of planetary systems and the possibility of atmospheric escape.

**Real-World Applications**:
Calculating the escape velocity of Mars is essential for missions such as NASA's Mars Sample Return, which aims to bring samples back from Mars to Earth. Knowing the escape velocity helps in designing the ascent vehicle that will lift off from the Martian surface.

**Problem**:

Derive an expression for the escape velocity $v_e$ from the surface of Mars. Mars has a mass $M$ and a radius $R$. Use the universal gravitational constant $G$ in your expression.

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $G$, $M$, and $R$ as a simplified radical expression. Do not include any other variables or numerical substitutions.

**Final Answer Format**:
- Provide a single simplified symbolic expression enclosed in \boxed{}.
- Use the notation `v_e` for the escape velocity in your derivation, but the final answer must be the expression only (e.g., $\sqrt{\text{...}}$).
- Do not use decimal approximations or evaluate any constants.

## Solution
**Step 1: Conservation of Mechanical Energy**  
The total mechanical energy of the object (kinetic + potential) must be conserved because gravity is a conservative force. At the surface of Mars, the object has initial kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy. At infinity, the object has zero kinetic energy and zero potential energy (by definition). The escape velocity corresponds to the minimum initial speed where the total energy is exactly zero.  

Set up the energy equation:  
Initial energy (at surface):  
$$ E_i = \frac{1}{2} m v_e^2 - \frac{G M m}{R} $$  
Final energy (at infinity):  
$$ E_f = 0 $$  
Conservation requires:  
$$ E_i = E_f $$  
$$ \frac{1}{2} m v_e^2 - \frac{G M m}{R} = 0 $$  

**Step 2: Solve for $v_e$**  
Divide both sides by $m$ (mass of the object, assumed nonzero):  
$$ \frac{1}{2} v_e^2 - \frac{G M}{R} = 0 $$  
Rearrange to isolate $v_e^2$:  
$$ \frac{1}{2} v_e^2 = \frac{G M}{R} $$  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
$$ v_e^2 = \frac{2 G M}{R} $$  
Take the positive square root (since velocity is a scalar magnitude):  
$$ v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The derived expression for the escape velocity from Mars is $\sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}}}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
In celestial mechanics, the gravitational force between two bodies follows Newton's law of universal gravitation. When an object moves under gravitational influence, the work done by gravity can be derived from fundamental principles. This problem explores the energy dynamics of a meteoroid falling toward Jupiter, demonstrating how gravitational potential energy transforms during the motion.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Newton's law of universal gravitation
- Work-energy theorem for conservative forces
- Integration of variable forces along radial paths
- Gravitational potential energy at infinity

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy (through the work-energy theorem) and reinforces the inverse-square nature of gravitational force. It also illustrates the conservation of mechanical energy in celestial systems.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The principles apply to astrophysics (e.g., calculating impact energies of meteoroids) and aerospace engineering (e.g., determining orbital insertion energies for spacecraft). The mathematics involves definite integration with infinite limits, a technique used in electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.

Real-World Applications:
Understanding this work calculation helps predict the kinetic energy of meteoroids during atmospheric entry, which influences crater formation studies and planetary defense models. Similar calculations are used to design gravity-assist maneuvers for space missions.

Problem:
A meteoroid of mass $m$ starts at rest infinitely far from Jupiter (mass $M$) and falls radially inward due to gravity. Jupiter is modeled as a uniform sphere with cloud tops at radius $R$ from its center. Derive an expression for the work $W$ done by gravity during this motion from infinity to $R$.  

Use the following symbols:  
- $G$ for the gravitational constant  
- $M$ for Jupiter's mass  
- $m$ for the meteoroid's mass  
- $R$ for Jupiter's radius at cloud tops  

Express $W$ symbolically in terms of $G$, $M$, $m$, and $R$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Gravitational force expression**  
The magnitude of the gravitational force on the meteoroid at distance $r$ from Jupiter's center is:  
$$ F(r) = \frac{G M m}{r^2} $$  
Since the force acts radially inward, and the displacement is also inward (direction aligned with force), the work done is positive.

**Step 2: Work integral setup**  
Work $W$ is the integral of force dot displacement. For radial motion:  
$$ W = \int_{\infty}^{R} \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} $$  
Using the radial component $F_r = - \frac{G M m}{r^2}$ (negative for inward direction in standard coordinates) and noting $d\vec{r}$ points outward:  
$$ \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = \left( - \frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r} \right) \cdot (dr  \hat{r}) = - \frac{G M m}{r^2}  dr $$  
The limits change from $r = \infty$ (start) to $r = R$ (end):  
$$ W = \int_{\infty}^{R} \left( - \frac{G M m}{r^2} \right) dr $$

**Step 3: Evaluate the integral**  
$$ W = -G M m \int_{\infty}^{R} r^{-2}  dr $$  
The antiderivative of $r^{-2}$ is $-r^{-1}$:  
$$ W = -G M m \left[ -\frac{1}{r} \right]_{\infty}^{R} = G M m \left[ \frac{1}{r} \right]_{\infty}^{R} $$  
Apply limits:  
$$ \left. \frac{1}{r} \right|_{\infty}^{R} = \frac{1}{R} - \lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{R} - 0 $$  
Thus:  
$$ W = G M m \left( \frac{1}{R} \right) = \frac{G M m}{R} $$

**Step 4: Verification via potential energy**  
Gravitational potential energy at distance $r$ is $U(r) = -\frac{G M m}{r}$. The work done by gravity equals the negative change in potential energy:  
$$ W = -\Delta U = - \left( U(R) - U(\infty) \right) $$  
Since $U(\infty) = 0$:  
$$ U(R) = -\frac{G M m}{R} \implies \Delta U = -\frac{G M m}{R} - 0 = -\frac{G M m}{R} $$  
$$ W = - \left( -\frac{G M m}{R} \right) = \frac{G M m}{R} $$  
Both methods confirm the result.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{G M m}{R}}$$

------
## Problem 3
Background:
Gravitational potential energy represents the energy stored in an object due to its position in a gravitational field. For a point mass or spherically symmetric body, the potential energy at distance $r$ from the center is $U = -G M m / r$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the central mass, and $m$ is the object's mass. When moving between celestial bodies, we consider the potential energy relative to each body independently.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Gravitational potential energy formula for spherical bodies
- Energy difference calculations
- Dimensional analysis and unit consistency

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects to orbital mechanics (escape velocity, Hohmann transfers)
- Relates to conservation of energy in gravitational systems

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Astronomy (celestial body parameters)
- Aerospace engineering (space mission energy requirements)

Real-World Applications:
- Calculating energy requirements for space missions (e.g., Apollo program)
- Satellite deployment and interplanetary travel logistics

Given:
- Object mass: $m$
- Earth's mass: $M_E$
- Earth's radius: $R_E$
- Moon's mass: $M_M$
- Moon's radius: $R_M$
- Gravitational constant: $G$

Problem:
Derive an expression for the change in gravitational potential energy $\Delta U$ when an object of mass $m$ is moved from Earth's surface to the Moon's surface. Use the definition $\Delta U = U_{\text{Moon}} - U_{\text{Earth}}$. Express your final answer in terms of $G, m, M_E, R_E, M_M, R_M$ and box the simplified expression.

Note: Assume both Earth and Moon are spherically symmetric and neglect their orbital motion.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define initial and final potential energy**  
At Earth's surface ($r = R_E$):  
$$ U_{\text{Earth}} = -\frac{G M_E m}{R_E} $$

At Moon's surface ($r = R_M$):  
$$ U_{\text{Moon}} = -\frac{G M_M m}{R_M} $$

**Step 2: Compute energy difference**  
$$ \Delta U = U_{\text{Moon}} - U_{\text{Earth}} = \left(-\frac{G M_M m}{R_M}\right) - \left(-\frac{G M_E m}{R_E}\right) $$

**Step 3: Simplify expression**  
$$ \Delta U = -\frac{G M_M m}{R_M} + \frac{G M_E m}{R_E} = G m \left( \frac{M_E}{R_E} - \frac{M_M}{R_M} \right) $$

**Step 4: Verify dimensions**  
- $G$: $\text{m}^3 \text{ kg}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-2}$  
- $m$: $\text{kg}$  
- $\frac{M}{R}$: $\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-1}$  
- Thus $G m \frac{M}{R}$ has units $\text{m}^3 \text{ kg}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-2} \cdot \text{kg} \cdot \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-1} = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2} = \text{J}$ (joules), confirming dimensional consistency.

The expression is fully simplified. No further reduction is possible without numerical values.

## Answer
$$ \boxed{G m \left( \frac{M_E}{R_E} - \frac{M_M}{R_M} \right)} $$

## Problem 4
**Background**  
Satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) circle the Earth at altitudes of 160–2,000 km, completing orbits in ~90 minutes. Geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), at ~35,786 km altitude, has an orbital period matching Earth's rotation, keeping satellites fixed relative to the surface. Transferring spacecraft between these orbits requires energy-efficient maneuvers. The Hohmann transfer orbit—an elliptical path tangent to both circular orbits—minimizes the kinetic energy needed. This problem explores the physics behind such transitions, focusing on energy conservation and gravitational dynamics.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy in orbital mechanics  
- Conservation of energy in celestial transitions  
- Centripetal force balance in circular orbits  
- Semi-major axis and energy of elliptical orbits  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
Connects gravitational potential energy to orbital velocity and centripetal acceleration (classical mechanics). Extends to Kepler’s laws for elliptical trajectories.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Aerospace engineering (satellite deployment), astronomy (celestial mechanics), and communication technology (geostationary satellites).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Deploying weather satellites (e.g., GOES) and communication satellites (e.g., DirecTV). Efficient orbit transfers reduce launch costs and fuel requirements.  

---

**Problem Statement**  
A spacecraft of mass $m$ is in a circular low Earth orbit (LEO) with radius $R_{\text{leo}}$. Derive the **total additional kinetic energy** that must be provided by its engines to transition to a circular geostationary orbit (GEO) with radius $R_{\text{geo}}$ ($R_{\text{geo}} > R_{\text{leo}}$), using a Hohmann transfer orbit. The Hohmann transfer is an elliptical orbit with perigee at $R_{\text{leo}}$ and apogee at $R_{\text{geo}}$.  

Assume:  
- Earth’s mass is $M$ and the gravitational constant is $G$.  
- Orbits are coplanar, and Earth’s rotation is negligible.  
- Engine boosts are instantaneous impulses applied at perigee and apogee.  

Express the total additional kinetic energy in terms of $G$, $M$, $m$, $R_{\text{leo}}$, and $R_{\text{geo}}$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Total mechanical energy in circular orbits**  
For a circular orbit of radius $r$, centripetal force equals gravitational force:  

$$
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
$$
  
Solve for kinetic energy $K$:  

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} m \left( \frac{G M}{r} \right) = \frac{G M m}{2r}
$$
  
Gravitational potential energy $U$ is:  

$$
U = -\frac{G M m}{r}
$$
  
Total mechanical energy $E$ is:  

$$
E = K + U = \frac{G M m}{2r} - \frac{G M m}{r} = -\frac{G M m}{2r}
$$
  
For LEO and GEO:  

$$
E_{\text{leo}} = -\frac{G M m}{2 R_{\text{leo}}}, \quad E_{\text{geo}} = -\frac{G M m}{2 R_{\text{geo}}}
$$


**Step 2: Total mechanical energy in Hohmann transfer orbit**  
The Hohmann ellipse has semi-major axis $a$:  

$$
a = \frac{R_{\text{leo}} + R_{\text{geo}}}{2}
$$
  
The total energy of an elliptical orbit depends only on $a$:  

$$
E_{\text{trans}} = -\frac{G M m}{2a} = -\frac{G M m}{R_{\text{leo}} + R_{\text{geo}}}
$$


**Step 3: Energy changes at engine boosts**  
- **First boost (LEO to transfer orbit):**  
  At perigee ($r = R_{\text{leo}}$), the spacecraft’s total energy changes from $E_{\text{leo}}$ to $E_{\text{trans}}$. The added kinetic energy $\Delta K_1$ is:  
  
$$
  \Delta K_1 = E_{\text{trans}} - E_{\text{leo}} = -\frac{G M m}{R_{\text{leo}} + R_{\text{geo}}} - \left( -\frac{G M m}{2 R_{\text{leo}}} \right) = G M m \left( \frac{1}{2 R_{\text{leo}}} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{leo}} + R_{\text{geo}}} \right)
  $$
  

- **Second boost (transfer orbit to GEO):**  
  At apogee ($r = R_{\text{geo}}$), the total energy changes from $E_{\text{trans}}$ to $E_{\text{geo}}$. The added kinetic energy $\Delta K_2$ is:  
  
$$
  \Delta K_2 = E_{\text{geo}} - E_{\text{trans}} = -\frac{G M m}{2 R_{\text{geo}}} - \left( -\frac{G M m}{R_{\text{leo}} + R_{\text{geo}}} \right) = G M m \left( \frac{1}{R_{\text{leo}} + R_{\text{geo}}} - \frac{1}{2 R_{\text{geo}}} \right)
  $$
  

**Step 4: Total additional kinetic energy**  
Sum the energy contributions from both boosts:  

$$
\Delta K_{\text{total}} = \Delta K_1 + \Delta K_2 = G M m \left[ \left( \frac{1}{2 R_{\text{leo}}} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{leo}} + R_{\text{geo}}} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{R_{\text{leo}} + R_{\text{geo}}} - \frac{1}{2 R_{\text{geo}}} \right) \right]
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
\Delta K_{\text{total}} = G M m \left( \frac{1}{2 R_{\text{leo}}} - \frac{1}{2 R_{\text{geo}}} \right) = \frac{G M m}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R_{\text{leo}}} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{geo}}} \right)
$$
  
The result is independent of the transfer path and equals the difference in total energy between GEO and LEO, as expected from conservation laws.

## Answer
$$
\boxed{\frac{G M m}{2} \left( \frac{1}{R_{\text{leo}}} - \frac{1}{R_{\text{geo}}} \right)}
$$

# horizontal and vertical velocity components

## Problem 0
**Background:**  
Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics where an object moves under the influence of gravity alone after being launched with an initial velocity. This motion can be analyzed by decomposing the initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal component remains constant (ignoring air resistance), while the vertical component changes due to the constant acceleration of gravity.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Decomposition of velocity into horizontal and vertical components.  
2. Application of the constant-acceleration kinematic equation $v_y = v_{y0} + a_y t$ in the vertical direction.  
3. Trigonometric relationships for resolving initial velocity.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem connects to kinematics in two dimensions, emphasizing the independence of horizontal and vertical motions. It also reinforces understanding of vector decomposition and constant acceleration in one dimension, which are foundational for advanced mechanics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Projectile motion principles are crucial in fields like aerospace engineering (e.g., rocket trajectories), sports science (e.g., analyzing a soccer ball's flight), and environmental science (e.g., modeling volcanic ejecta).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Accurate prediction of a projectile's velocity components is essential for applications such as precision targeting in ballistics, optimizing athletic performance in javelin or long jump, and designing safety protocols for fireworks displays.  

**Problem Statement:**  
A projectile is launched from ground level with an initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$ (directed downward). Derive an expression for the vertical component of the velocity ($v_y$) at time $t$ after launch. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $v_0$, $\theta$, $t$, and $g$.  

**Specific Case for Numerical Evaluation:**  
Using the expression you derived, compute $v_y$ for $v_0 = 40  \text{m/s}$, $\theta = 37^\circ$ (where $\sin 37^\circ = 3/5$), $t = 2  \text{s}$, and $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$. Provide the numerical value of $v_y$ in meters per second (m/s), rounded to one decimal place.  

**Final Answer Format:**  
- For the symbolic derivation, use $v_0$, $\theta$, $t$, and $g$.  
- For the numerical answer, provide **only the numerical value** (without units) rounded to one decimal place.  
- Use $\sin$, $\cos$ for trigonometric functions (angles in degrees).  
- Use a caret (`^`) for exponents (e.g., $t^2$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Resolve the initial velocity into components.**  
The initial velocity $v_0$ has:  
- Horizontal component: $v_{0x} = v_0 \cos \theta$  
- Vertical component: $v_{0y} = v_0 \sin \theta$  

**Step 2: Apply the kinematic equation for vertical motion.**  
The vertical motion has constant acceleration $a_y = -g$ (negative because gravity opposes upward motion). The vertical velocity at time $t$ is given by:  

$$
v_y = v_{0y} + a_y t
$$
  
Substitute $v_{0y} = v_0 \sin \theta$ and $a_y = -g$:  

$$
v_y = v_0 \sin \theta - g t
$$
  
This is the general symbolic expression for the vertical velocity at time $t$.  

**Step 3: Evaluate for the specific case.**  
Given:  
- $v_0 = 40  \text{m/s}$  
- $\sin \theta = \sin 37^\circ = 3/5$  
- $t = 2  \text{s}$  
- $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$  

Substitute into the expression:  

$$
v_y = (40) \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5} \right) - (9.8) \cdot (2)
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
v_y = 40 \times 0.6 - 19.6 = 24 - 19.6 = 4.4
$$
  
The vertical velocity after 2 seconds is $4.4  \text{m/s}$ (upward).  

**Final numerical answer:** $4.4$ (rounded to one decimal place).

## Answer
$$\boxed{4.4}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**

In the study of relative motion, the velocity of an object relative to a reference frame is the vector sum of its velocity relative to a moving medium and the velocity of that medium relative to the reference frame. This principle is essential in navigation scenarios, such as boats moving in rivers or aircraft flying in wind currents. For this problem, we consider a river flowing eastward and a boat moving relative to the water. The "northwest" direction is defined as exactly 45° north of west, which corresponds to 135° from the positive eastward axis in the standard Cartesian coordinate system (east: positive x-axis, north: positive y-axis). Trigonometric functions for standard angles (e.g., 135°) yield exact values that can be expressed using radicals.

**Knowledge Points Tested**
1. Vector decomposition of velocities into horizontal (east-west) and vertical (north-south) components.
2. Vector addition for relative motion in two dimensions.
3. Trigonometric resolution of velocity vectors at specified angles.
4. Interpretation of directional terms (e.g., "northwest") in navigation contexts.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
This problem connects to broader kinematics concepts, including projectile motion (where horizontal and vertical components are independently analyzed) and circular motion (via angular descriptions). It reinforces the principle of Galilean relativity and lays groundwork for understanding inertial reference frames in advanced mechanics.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
The vector resolution technique applies directly to mathematics (vector algebra and trigonometry). In engineering, similar calculations are used for trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles, while environmental science employs these principles to model pollutant dispersion in flowing water.

**Real-World Applications**
Pilots adjusting flight paths for wind drift, boat operators navigating rivers or oceans, and engineers designing river-crossing ferries must all compute ground velocities by combining motion relative to a medium with the medium's own velocity. GPS systems also rely on such vector computations for real-time positioning.

**Problem Statement**
A river flows east at speed $v_r$. A boat moves at speed $v_b$ relative to the water in the northwest direction. Derive an expression for the eastward component of the boat's velocity relative to the ground. Express your answer in terms of $v_r$ and $v_b$.  

**Note:**  
- Use degrees for trigonometric functions.  
- Omit degree symbols (°) in trigonometric functions.  
- Express all trigonometric functions of non-standard angles in exact radical form.  
- The final answer must be a simplified expression using the variables $v_r$ and $v_b$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define coordinate system and velocity vectors**  
Set east as the positive $x$-direction and north as the positive $y$-direction.  
- River velocity relative to ground: $\vec{v}_r = v_r \hat{\imath} + 0 \hat{\jmath}$.  
- Boat velocity relative to water: Directed northwest, which is $135^\circ$ from the positive $x$-axis (since $180^\circ - 45^\circ = 135^\circ$).

**Step 2: Resolve boat's velocity into components**  
The boat's velocity relative to water has magnitude $v_b$ at $135^\circ$. Its components are:  
- $x$-component (east-west): $v_{b,x} = v_b \cos 135^\circ$,  
- $y$-component (north-south): $v_{b,y} = v_b \sin 135^\circ$.  

Using exact trigonometric values:  

$$
\cos 135^\circ = -\cos 45^\circ = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad \sin 135^\circ = \sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$
  
Thus:  

$$
\vec{v}_b = v_b \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \hat{\imath} + v_b \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \hat{\jmath}.
$$


**Step 3: Compute ground velocity of the boat**  
The boat's velocity relative to ground ($\vec{v}_g$) is the vector sum of its velocity relative to water and the river's velocity relative to ground:  

$$
\vec{v}_g = \vec{v}_r + \vec{v}_b = \left[ v_r \hat{\imath} \right] + \left[ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} v_b \hat{\imath} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} v_b \hat{\jmath} \right].
$$
  
Combine $x$- and $y$-components:  

$$
\vec{v}_g = \left( v_r - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} v_b \right) \hat{\imath} + \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} v_b \right) \hat{\jmath}.
$$


**Step 4: Extract the eastward component**  
The eastward component is the $x$-component of $\vec{v}_g$:  

$$
v_{g,x} = v_r - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} v_b.
$$
  
This is the final expression for the eastward component of the boat's ground velocity.

## Answer
$$\boxed{v_r - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} v_b}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
In projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical components of velocity are independent. Without air resistance, the horizontal velocity remains constant, while the vertical velocity changes due to gravity. However, real-world scenarios often involve air resistance. Consider a simplified model where horizontal air resistance causes a constant deceleration $a_d$ opposite to the direction of motion. This deceleration directly affects the horizontal velocity component over time. The vertical motion remains governed by gravity, but this problem focuses on the horizontal component.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Independence of horizontal and vertical motion in projectile motion.
- Application of kinematic equations for constant acceleration in the horizontal direction.
- Interpretation of velocity components under external forces (e.g., air resistance).

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects to Newton's laws of motion, where forces perpendicular to each other act independently. It also reinforces kinematics in two dimensions, a foundation for advanced topics like orbital mechanics and fluid dynamics.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Understanding velocity components under resistance is crucial in fields like aerospace engineering (e.g., re-entry vehicles), sports science (e.g., trajectory of balls), and environmental science (e.g., particle dispersion in wind).

Real-World Applications:
The horizontal deceleration model applies to objects moving through resistive media, such as a skydiver with a drogue parachute, a car with constant braking force, or a hockey puck sliding on ice with friction.

Problem:
A stone is thrown horizontally from a cliff with initial horizontal velocity $v_0$. It experiences a constant horizontal deceleration $a_d$ due to air resistance. Derive an expression for the horizontal component of the stone's velocity at time $t$ after release. Express your answer in terms of $v_0$, $a_d$, and $t$.

**Final Answer Format**:  
Provide a symbolic expression. Use $\exp$ for the exponential function (e.g., $\exp(x)$ for $e^x$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify the horizontal motion equation**  
The horizontal acceleration $a_x$ is constant and opposite to the initial velocity direction:  
$$ a_x = -a_d $$  
where $a_d > 0$ is the magnitude of deceleration.  

**Step 2: Apply the kinematic equation for velocity**  
The general equation for velocity under constant acceleration is:  
$$ v_x = u_x + a_x t $$  
where:  
- $u_x = v_0$ is the initial horizontal velocity,  
- $a_x = -a_d$ is the horizontal acceleration,  
- $t$ is time.  

**Step 3: Substitute and simplify**  
Substitute the values into the equation:  
$$ v_x = v_0 + (-a_d) t $$  
$$ v_x = v_0 - a_d t $$  

**Conclusion**  
The horizontal component of velocity at time $t$ is $v_0 - a_d t$. This expression is valid for $t \leq \frac{v_0}{a_d}$ (until horizontal velocity reaches zero).

## Answer
$$\boxed{v_0 - a_d t}$$

------
## Problem 3
Background:
Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics where an object moves under the influence of gravity after being launched. The motion can be analyzed by separating it into horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal motion occurs at constant velocity, while the vertical motion experiences constant acceleration due to gravity ($g$). This problem explores how these components interact at a key point in the trajectory.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Decomposition of initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components
- Application of kinematic equations for motion under constant acceleration
- Calculation of maximum height in projectile motion
- Relationship between vertical displacement and vertical velocity

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects kinematics to energy conservation principles, as the maximum height corresponds to the point where kinetic energy is minimized and potential energy is maximized. It also reinforces the independence of motion in perpendicular directions.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Projectile motion analysis is crucial in fields like aerospace engineering (rocket trajectories), sports science (optimizing athletic throws), and environmental science (modeling volcanic ejecta).

Real-World Applications:
Understanding velocity components helps in designing projectile-based systems, such as water cannons for firefighting, artillery targeting in defense systems, and trajectory planning for robotic throwing arms in manufacturing.

Problem:
A cannonball is launched from ground level with an initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal. Air resistance is negligible, and gravitational acceleration is $g$. Determine the vertical component of the cannonball's velocity when it is descending through a height equal to half its maximum height. Express your answer in terms of $v_0$ and $\theta$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Resolve initial velocity**  
The vertical component of initial velocity is:  
$$ v_{y0} = v_0 \sin \theta $$

**Step 2: Derive maximum height ($H$)**  
At maximum height, vertical velocity $v_y = 0$. Using the kinematic equation:  
$$ v_y^2 = v_{y0}^2 - 2g y $$  
Substitute $v_y = 0$ and $y = H$:  
$$ 0 = (v_0 \sin \theta)^2 - 2gH $$  
Solve for $H$:  
$$ H = \frac{(v_0 \sin \theta)^2}{2g} $$

**Step 3: Identify target height**  
Half-maximum height is:  
$$ y = \frac{H}{2} = \frac{(v_0 \sin \theta)^2}{4g} $$

**Step 4: Apply kinematic equation at target height**  
Using the same kinematic equation with $y = H/2$:  
$$ v_y^2 = (v_0 \sin \theta)^2 - 2g \left( \frac{(v_0 \sin \theta)^2}{4g} \right) $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ v_y^2 = (v_0 \sin \theta)^2 - \frac{(v_0 \sin \theta)^2}{2} $$  
$$ v_y^2 = (v_0 \sin \theta)^2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) $$  
$$ v_y^2 = \frac{1}{2} (v_0 \sin \theta)^2 $$  
Take the square root:  
$$ |v_y| = \frac{v_0 \sin \theta}{\sqrt{2}} $$

**Step 5: Determine sign based on motion direction**  
Since the cannonball is descending, the vertical velocity component is negative:  
$$ v_y = -\frac{v_0 \sin \theta}{\sqrt{2}} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{-\dfrac{v_0 \sin \theta}{\sqrt{2}}}$$

# impulse-momentum theorem applications

## Problem 0
**Background: Drone Package Delivery and Impulse-Momentum Theorem**

In modern logistics, drones are used for package delivery. When a drone releases a package mid-flight, aerodynamic forces and gravity act on it, changing its velocity. The impulse-momentum theorem provides a powerful tool to analyze such scenarios: the impulse $\vec{J}$ delivered by the net force equals the change in momentum $\Delta \vec{p}$ of the object. For an object of mass $m$ with initial velocity $\vec{v_i}$ and final velocity $\vec{v_f}$, this is expressed as:

$$
\vec{J} = \Delta \vec{p} = m(\vec{v_f} - \vec{v_i}).
$$

Direction matters significantly, as impulse and momentum are vector quantities.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**
- Vector subtraction in momentum change calculations
- Coordinate system conventions for directional motion
- Impulse-momentum theorem applications
- Interpretation of impulse as a vector quantity

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**
Connects to Newton's second law ($\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$), conservation of momentum in isolated systems, and projectile motion kinematics.

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**
- Engineering: Force analysis in drone design and package cushioning
- Environmental science: Wind resistance effects on delivery systems
- Mathematics: Vector operations and coordinate transformations

**Real-World Applications:**
Calculating impact forces in logistics (package handling), automotive safety (airbag deployment), and sports science (analyzing ball impacts in baseball/tennis).

**Problem:**

A drone releases a package of mass $m$ with an initial velocity of magnitude $v_i$ directed exactly **west**. After aerodynamic forces act during flight, the package lands with a final velocity of magnitude $v_f$ directed exactly **east**. Assume a standard coordinate system where **east** is the positive $x$-direction. 

Using the impulse-momentum theorem, derive an expression for the impulse $\vec{J}$ delivered to the package. Express the impulse by its $x$-component $J_x$ (a scalar representing the east-west directional effect).

**Required Format for Final Answer:**
Express $J_x$ symbolically in terms of $m$, $v_i$, and $v_f$. Use exactly these variable names. The answer must be a single algebraic expression without units.  
Example of valid format: $m(v_f - v_i)$

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the coordinate system and velocity components**  
- Establish east as the positive $x$-direction.  
- Initial velocity $\vec{v_i}$:  
  Magnitude $v_i$ west → negative $x$-direction → $\vec{v_i} = -v_i \hat{\imath}$.  
- Final velocity $\vec{v_f}$:  
  Magnitude $v_f$ east → positive $x$-direction → $\vec{v_f} = v_f \hat{\imath}$.  

**Step 2: Apply the impulse-momentum theorem**  
The impulse $\vec{J}$ is given by:  

$$
\vec{J} = \Delta \vec{p} = m(\vec{v_f} - \vec{v_i}).
$$


**Step 3: Substitute velocity vectors**  

$$
\vec{J} = m\left[ (v_f \hat{\imath}) - (-v_i \hat{\imath}) \right] = m\left( v_f \hat{\imath} + v_i \hat{\imath} \right) = m(v_f + v_i) \hat{\imath}.
$$


**Step 4: Extract the $x$-component**  
The impulse vector is $\vec{J} = J_x \hat{\imath}$, where:  

$$
J_x = m(v_f + v_i).
$$


**Conclusion:**  
The $x$-component of the impulse delivered to the package is $m(v_f + v_i)$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{m(v_f + v_i)}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
In automotive safety engineering, the impulse-momentum theorem plays a crucial role in analyzing collision dynamics. When a vehicle decelerates rapidly during a collision, the average force experienced by passengers determines injury risk. Crumple zones are designed to extend the collision duration, reducing this force. The impulse-momentum theorem states that the impulse ($\vec{J}$) applied to an object equals its change in momentum ($\Delta \vec{p}$), mathematically expressed as $\vec{J} = \vec{F}_{\text{avg}} \Delta t = \Delta \vec{p}$, where $\vec{F}_{\text{avg}}$ is the average net force and $\Delta t$ is the time interval.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Application of the impulse-momentum theorem in one-dimensional motion
- Relationship between force, mass, velocity, and time
- Interpretation of average force in collision dynamics

Intradisciplinary Connections:
Connects to Newton's second law ($\vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$) and kinetic energy concepts, as force-time integrals govern momentum changes while force-distance integrals govern energy changes.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Relates to mechanical engineering (vehicle safety design), biomechanics (impact force analysis on human bodies), and materials science (energy-absorbing materials in crumple zones).

Real-World Applications:
Used in crash-test simulations, airbag deployment algorithms, and highway barrier design to minimize collision forces. For example, modern vehicles extend $\Delta t$ to 0.1-0.2 s in frontal collisions, reducing peak forces by 50-70% compared to rigid impacts.

Problem:
A car of mass $m$ moving at initial velocity $v_i$ collides with a fixed barrier and decelerates uniformly to rest in time $\Delta t$. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the average braking force $F_{\text{avg}}$ exerted by the barrier during the collision. Express $F_{\text{avg}}$ solely in terms of $m$, $v_i$, and $\Delta t$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply impulse-momentum theorem**  
The change in momentum is $\Delta p = p_f - p_i$, where $p_f = 0$ (final momentum at rest) and $p_i = m v_i$ (initial momentum).  
$$\Delta p = 0 - m v_i = -m v_i$$

**Step 2: Relate impulse to average force**  
Impulse $J$ equals the product of average force $F_{\text{avg}}$ and collision time $\Delta t$. Since the braking force opposes motion:  
$$J = -F_{\text{avg}} \Delta t \quad \text{(negative sign indicates direction)}$$

**Step 3: Equate impulse to momentum change**  
By the impulse-momentum theorem:  
$$J = \Delta p$$  
Substitute expressions from Steps 1-2:  
$$-F_{\text{avg}} \Delta t = -m v_i$$

**Step 4: Solve for $F_{\text{avg}}$**  
Divide both sides by $-\Delta t$:  
$$F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{m v_i}{\Delta t}$$  
This gives the magnitude of the average braking force. The direction is implied by the context (opposing initial motion).

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{m v_i}{\Delta t}}$$

## Problem 2
**Background:**  
In space missions, astronauts often maneuver by pushing off structures. Consider an astronaut of mass $m$ initially at rest relative to a space station. The astronaut pushes against a handrail with a constant force $F$ for a time interval $\Delta t$. The space station is much more massive than the astronaut, so its motion is negligible. No other forces act during the push.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. **Impulse-momentum theorem**: The impulse ($J$) equals the change in momentum ($\Delta p$), where $J = F \Delta t$ for constant force.  
2. **Momentum definition**: Momentum ($p$) is mass ($m$) times velocity ($v$), and $\Delta p = m \Delta v$ for constant mass.  
3. **Velocity change**: Final speed derivation from initial rest conditions.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Relates to Newton’s second law ($F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$) and kinematics ($v_f = a \Delta t$ for constant acceleration).  
- Extends to variable-force scenarios via integral forms of impulse.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Biomechanics**: Muscle force application in sports (e.g., swimmers pushing off walls).  
- **Aerospace engineering**: Thruster-based navigation in spacecraft.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Astronaut mobility during extravehicular activities (EVAs).  
- Impact absorption in vehicle safety systems (e.g., crumple zones increase $\Delta t$ to reduce $F$).  

**Problem:**  
An astronaut of mass $m = 60 \text{ kg}$ pushes off a space station handrail with a constant force $F = 300 \text{ N}$ for $\Delta t = 0.4 \text{ s}$. Derive an expression for the astronaut’s final speed relative to the station, then compute its numerical value.  

**Instructions:**  
- Derive the final speed $v_f$ symbolically using the impulse-momentum theorem.  
- Substitute given values to obtain a numerical answer.  
- Express the final numerical answer in meters per second ($\text{m/s}$), providing **only the number** (no units).  
- Round your answer to **three significant digits** if necessary.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply the impulse-momentum theorem.**  
The impulse $J$ equals the change in momentum $\Delta p$:  
$$ J = \Delta p $$  
For constant force $F$ acting over time $\Delta t$:  
$$ J = F \Delta t $$  
The change in momentum is $\Delta p = m v_f - m v_i$, where $v_i$ is the initial velocity and $v_f$ is the final velocity. Since the astronaut starts at rest ($v_i = 0$):  
$$ \Delta p = m v_f $$  

**Step 2: Equate impulse and momentum change.**  
$$ F \Delta t = m v_f $$  

**Step 3: Solve for the final velocity $v_f$.**  
$$ v_f = \frac{F \Delta t}{m} $$  

**Step 4: Substitute numerical values.**  
Given $F = 300 \text{ N}$, $\Delta t = 0.4 \text{ s}$, and $m = 60 \text{ kg}$:  
$$ v_f = \frac{(300) \cdot (0.4)}{60} = \frac{120}{60} = 2.00 $$  

The final speed is $2.00 \text{ m/s}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{2.00}$$

## Problem 3
### Background
In sports such as tennis, understanding the forces during ball-surface collisions is crucial for equipment design and injury prevention. When a ball hits a rigid surface like concrete, it experiences a rapid change in momentum due to the impulse delivered by the wall. The impulse-momentum theorem, which states that the impulse acting on an object equals its change in momentum, provides a foundation for analyzing such collisions. This theorem bypasses the need for detailed force-time profiles and directly relates measurable velocities to the net effect of forces.

#### Knowledge Points Tested
- **Impulse-momentum theorem**: Relating impulse to change in momentum ($\vec{J} = \Delta \vec{p}$).
- **Vector nature of momentum**: Handling directionality in one-dimensional collisions.
- **Magnitude calculation**: Computing the magnitude of a vector quantity from its components.

#### Intradisciplinary Connections
- **Forces and motion**: Extends Newton's second law ($\vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$) to finite time intervals via impulse ($\vec{J} = \int \vec{F}  dt$).
- **Energy considerations**: While impulse relates to momentum change, energy loss (seen in rebound speed) connects to the coefficient of restitution, a topic in collision dynamics.

#### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Sports science**: Optimizing ball materials and court surfaces to control rebound characteristics.
- **Biomechanics**: Analyzing impact forces in human joints during athletic movements.

#### Real-World Applications
- Designing shock-absorbing sports gear (e.g., tennis shoes) to reduce impulse-driven forces by extending collision time.
- Engineering crumple zones in vehicles, where impulse principles minimize passenger injury by managing momentum changes.

### Problem Statement
A tennis ball of mass $m$ approaches a rigid concrete wall horizontally at speed $v_i$. The ball rebounds horizontally at speed $v_f$ in the exact opposite direction. The wall is fixed and does not move during the collision. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the impulse imparted to the ball by the wall. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $m$, $v_i$, and $v_f$.

**Final Answer Format Requirements**  
- Provide the magnitude of the impulse as a single symbolic expression.  
- Use only the variables $m$, $v_i$, and $v_f$.  
- Do not include units in the expression.

## Solution
### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Define the coordinate system**:  
   - Choose the positive direction as the rebound direction (away from the wall).  
   - Thus, the initial velocity (toward the wall) is negative: $\vec{v_i} = -v_i \hat{\imath}$, where $v_i > 0$ and $\hat{\imath}$ is the unit vector.  
   - The final velocity (rebound) is positive: $\vec{v_f} = v_f \hat{\imath}$, with $v_f > 0$.  

2. **Express initial and final momentum**:  
   - Initial momentum: $\vec{p_i} = m \vec{v_i} = m (-v_i \hat{\imath}) = -m v_i \hat{\imath}$.  
   - Final momentum: $\vec{p_f} = m \vec{v_f} = m v_f \hat{\imath}$.  

3. **Apply the impulse-momentum theorem**:  
   The impulse $\vec{J}$ imparted to the ball is:  
   
$$
   \vec{J} = \Delta \vec{p} = \vec{p_f} - \vec{p_i}.
   $$
  
   Substitute the momenta:  
   
$$
   \vec{J} = (m v_f \hat{\imath}) - (-m v_i \hat{\imath}) = m v_f \hat{\imath} + m v_i \hat{\imath} = m(v_i + v_f) \hat{\imath}.
   $$
  

4. **Compute the magnitude of impulse**:  
   The impulse vector is $\vec{J} = m(v_i + v_f) \hat{\imath}$, so its magnitude is the absolute value of its $x$-component:  
   
$$
   |\vec{J}| = \left| m(v_i + v_f) \right|.
   $$
  
   Since $m > 0$, $v_i > 0$, and $v_f > 0$, this simplifies to:  
   
$$
   |\vec{J}| = m(v_i + v_f).
   $$
  

**Conclusion**: The magnitude of the impulse is $m(v_i + v_f)$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{m(v_i + v_f)}$$

## Problem 4
Background:
In automotive safety testing, crash test dummies are used to study collision dynamics. During a simulated frontal impact, an airbag deploys and exerts a force on the dummy that increases linearly with time. This design aims to provide controlled deceleration. The force profile is modeled as $ F(t) = kt $, where $ k $ is a constant. The change in the dummy's velocity depends on the impulse delivered by this force.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Impulse-momentum theorem: Relates the integral of force over time to the change in momentum.
- Integration of linear functions: Required to compute the impulse from a time-dependent force.
- Newton's second law in integral form: Connects force, mass, and velocity change.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Relates to work-energy theorem, as both involve force integrals but over different domains (time vs. distance).
- Extends constant-force kinematics to time-varying scenarios, emphasizing calculus-based physics.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Mathematics: Integral calculus for computing impulse.
- Engineering: Force profile design in safety systems (e.g., airbags, crumple zones) to minimize injury.

Real-World Applications:
Airbag systems in vehicles use controlled force profiles to reduce occupant acceleration during crashes. Linear force models approximate real-world deployment mechanisms, where force ramps up to mitigate peak deceleration.

Problem Statement:
A crash test dummy of mass $ m = 2  \text{kg} $ experiences a force $ F(t) = 10t  \text{N} $ from an airbag, where $ t $ is time in seconds. The force acts during the interval $ 0 \leq t \leq 2  \text{s} $. If the dummy's initial velocity is $ 0  \text{m/s} $, compute the change in velocity. Express your answer as a numerical value in meters per second.

## Solution
The impulse-momentum theorem states that the change in momentum equals the impulse applied:
$$ \Delta p = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} F(t)  dt $$
Since momentum $ p = mv $, the change in velocity $ \Delta v $ is:
$$ m \Delta v = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} F(t)  dt $$
$$ \Delta v = \frac{1}{m} \int_{t_i}^{t_f} F(t)  dt $$
Substitute $ m = 2  \text{kg} $, $ F(t) = 10t  \text{N} $, $ t_i = 0  \text{s} $, and $ t_f = 2  \text{s} $:
$$ \Delta v = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{2} 10t  dt $$
Factor out constants:
$$ \Delta v = \frac{10}{2} \int_{0}^{2} t  dt = 5 \int_{0}^{2} t  dt $$
Compute the integral:
$$ \int_{0}^{2} t  dt = \left[ \frac{t^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{2} = \frac{(2)^2}{2} - \frac{(0)^2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - 0 = 2 $$
Thus:
$$ \Delta v = 5 \times 2 = 10  \text{m/s} $$
The change in velocity is $ 10  \text{m/s} $.

# instantaneous and average power calculations

## Problem 0
**Background**:  
In engineering and physics, understanding power requirements is crucial for designing systems that move objects against gravity and other resistive forces. Consider a scenario where an object is lifted vertically. The instantaneous power delivered by the lifting mechanism must overcome both gravitational force and air resistance. Air resistance, a force proportional to the square of the object's speed, is significant in real-world applications like crane operations, drone lifts, or elevator systems. This problem explores how constant-velocity motion affects power calculations when resistive forces are present.

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. Application of Newton's second law for constant-velocity motion.  
2. Definition of instantaneous power as the dot product of force and velocity.  
3. Modeling of non-conservative forces (e.g., air resistance).  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
- Connects to kinematics (constant velocity implies zero net force).  
- Relates to work-energy principles (power as the rate of work done against forces).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
- **Engineering**: Power calculations are essential for mechanical systems (e.g., motors in cranes).  
- **Environmental Science**: Air resistance models are used in aerodynamics and fluid dynamics.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
- Calculating power requirements for construction cranes lifting beams in windy conditions.  
- Determining battery load in drones maintaining hover under crosswinds.  

**Problem**:  
An object of mass $m$ is lifted vertically upward at a constant velocity $\vec{v}$, where $v$ is the speed. The air resistance force is given by $\vec{F}_{\text{air}} = -k v^2 \hat{y}$, where $k$ is a positive constant, $v$ is the speed, and $\hat{y}$ is the upward unit vector. Derive an expression for the instantaneous power delivered by the lifting mechanism. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $g$, $k$, and $v$.  

**Final Answer Format**:  
- Provide a single mathematical expression.  
- Use multiplication dots ($\cdot$) for clarity (e.g., $m \cdot g$).  
- Use $v^2$ for squared terms.  
- Do not include units or numerical values.  
- Example format: $\boxed{a \cdot b + c \cdot d^e}$

## Solution
**Step 1: Analyze forces during constant-velocity motion**  
Since velocity is constant, the net force is zero (Newton's second law). The forces acting vertically are:  
- Gravitational force: $\vec{F}_g = -mg \hat{y}$ (downward).  
- Air resistance: $\vec{F}_{\text{air}} = -k v^2 \hat{y}$ (downward, opposes motion).  
- Lifting force: $\vec{F}_{\text{lift}} = F_{\text{lift}} \hat{y}$ (upward).  
The net force equation is:  
$$ \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_{\text{lift}} + \vec{F}_g + \vec{F}_{\text{air}} = 0 $$  
Substituting expressions:  
$$ F_{\text{lift}} \hat{y} - mg \hat{y} - k v^2 \hat{y} = 0 $$  
$$ F_{\text{lift}} = mg + k v^2 \quad (1) $$  

**Step 2: Apply the definition of instantaneous power**  
Instantaneous power $P$ is the dot product of the lifting force and velocity:  
$$ P = \vec{F}_{\text{lift}} \cdot \vec{v} $$  
Since both $\vec{F}_{\text{lift}}$ and $\vec{v} = v \hat{y}$ are parallel:  
$$ P = F_{\text{lift}} \cdot v \quad (2) $$  

**Step 3: Substitute the lifting force into the power equation**  
Insert equation (1) into equation (2):  
$$ P = (mg + k v^2) \cdot v $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ P = mg v + k v^3 $$  

**Conclusion**:  
The instantaneous power delivered is $mgv + kv^3$.

## Problem 1
Background:
In automotive physics, the power delivered by a car engine is a critical performance metric. Power represents the rate at which work is done, and for a moving vehicle, the instantaneous power is given by the dot product of force and velocity. When a car accelerates under constant engine force with no dissipative forces (such as friction or air resistance), the motion follows Newton's second law, resulting in constant acceleration. This scenario allows us to explore the relationship between force, velocity, work, and power through kinematic equations and integration.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Newton's second law for constant mass and constant force: $ F = ma $.
2. Kinematic equation for velocity under constant acceleration: $ v(t) = at $.
3. Instantaneous power: $ P(t) = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{v} = Fv(t) $ (for one-dimensional motion in the direction of force).
4. Average power as the time integral of instantaneous power: $ \langle P \rangle = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T P(t)  dt $.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects kinematics (velocity as a function of time under constant acceleration) with energy concepts (work and power). It demonstrates how Newton's laws and calculus integrate to derive a practical quantity like average power, reinforcing the principle that power is work per unit time.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The calculation of engine power has applications in mechanical engineering (vehicle design), environmental science (fuel efficiency and emissions), and transportation planning. Understanding power requirements helps optimize engine performance and energy consumption in real-world systems.

Real-World Applications:
Automakers use such calculations to determine engine specifications for target acceleration profiles. For example, the average power output during acceleration phases influences fuel economy ratings and battery drain in electric vehicles. Traffic safety engineers also analyze power curves to assess vehicle merging capabilities on highways.

Problem Statement:
A car starts from rest on a straight horizontal road. The engine exerts a constant force of 1500 N in the direction of motion, and there are no dissipative forces. After exactly 10 seconds, the car reaches a speed of 20 m/s. Determine the average power delivered by the engine over these 10 seconds.  
Express your answer in watts and provide only the numerical value.

## Solution
**Step 1: Relate force, mass, and acceleration**  
Given constant engine force $ F = 1500 \, \text{N} $ and no other forces, Newton's second law gives:  

$$ F = ma $$
  
where $ m $ is the mass of the car and $ a $ is the constant acceleration. Thus,  

$$ a = \frac{F}{m} $$


**Step 2: Express velocity as a function of time**  
Since the car starts from rest, initial velocity $ v(0) = 0 $. The velocity at time $ t $ is:  

$$ v(t) = at = \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) t $$


**Step 3: Write instantaneous power**  
The instantaneous power delivered by the engine is:  

$$ P(t) = F \cdot v(t) = F \cdot \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) t = \frac{F^2}{m} t $$


**Step 4: Derive average power**  
The average power over time interval $ T = 10 \, \text{s} $ is:  

$$ \langle P \rangle = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T P(t)  dt = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \frac{F^2}{m} t  dt $$
  
Solve the integral:  

$$ \int_0^T t  dt = \left[ \frac{1}{2} t^2 \right]_0^T = \frac{1}{2} T^2 $$
  
Substitute:  

$$ \langle P \rangle = \frac{1}{T} \cdot \frac{F^2}{m} \cdot \frac{1}{2} T^2 = \frac{F^2 T}{2m} $$


**Step 5: Use final velocity to eliminate mass**  
At $ t = T = 10 \, \text{s} $, the velocity is $ v(T) = 20 \, \text{m/s} $:  

$$ v(T) = aT = \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) T = 20 $$
  
Solve for $ m $:  

$$ \frac{F T}{m} = 20 \implies m = \frac{F T}{20} $$


**Step 6: Substitute $ m $ into the average power expression**  

$$ \langle P \rangle = \frac{F^2 T}{2m} = \frac{F^2 T}{2 \left( \frac{F T}{20} \right)} = \frac{F^2 T \cdot 20}{2 F T} = \frac{F \cdot 20}{2} $$
  
Simplify:  

$$ \langle P \rangle = \frac{20F}{2} = 10F $$


**Step 7: Compute numerical value**  
Substitute $ F = 1500 \, \text{N} $:  

$$ \langle P \rangle = 10 \times 1500 = 15000 $$
  
The average power is 15000 watts.

## Answer
$$\boxed{15000}$$

## Problem 2
**Background**  
In cycling, the mechanical power output required to maintain constant speed arises from overcoming resistive forces. On level ground, the primary forces are air resistance and rolling resistance. Air resistance is proportional to the square of the cyclist's speed due to fluid dynamics principles, while rolling resistance remains approximately constant for a given bicycle-rider system. Mechanical power $P$ is the product of the net force opposing motion and the velocity ($P = F_{\text{net}} \cdot v$).  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Relationship between mechanical power, force, and velocity: $P = F \cdot v$.  
2. Modeling air resistance as $F_{\text{air}} = k v^2$, where $k$ is a proportionality constant.  
3. Solving systems of equations with linear and quadratic terms.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates kinematics (velocity), dynamics (force), and energy (power). It extends Newton's second law to power calculations, emphasizing how force models (e.g., air resistance) are derived from empirical observations.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The air resistance model connects to fluid dynamics (physics/engineering). The system-solving approach applies algebraic techniques (mathematics) to a real-world scenario.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Cyclists and engineers use such models to optimize performance and efficiency. For example, aerodynamic designs minimize $k$, and power meters help athletes gauge effort.  

**Problem Statement**  
A cyclist on level ground experiences air resistance $F_{\text{air}} = k v^2$ and a constant rolling resistance $F_r$. When maintaining $v_1 = 6  \text{m/s}$, the air resistance is $40  \text{N}$. When maintaining $v_2 = 4  \text{m/s}$, the total mechanical power output is $100  \text{W}$.  

What is the mechanical power output (in watts) when the cyclist maintains $6  \text{m/s}$?  

Express your answer as an exact fraction. Do not include the unit in your answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Determine $k$ using the condition at $v_1 = 6  \text{m/s}$.**  
Given $F_{\text{air},1} = k v_1^2 = 40  \text{N}$:  
$$  
k (6)^2 = 40 \implies 36k = 40 \implies k = \frac{40}{36} = \frac{10}{9}  \text{N} \cdot \text{s}^2 / \text{m}^2.  
$$  

**Step 2: Express total resistive force and power at $v_2 = 4  \text{m/s}$.**  
Total resistive force: $F_{\text{net}} = F_{\text{air}} + F_r = k v^2 + F_r$.  
At $v_2 = 4  \text{m/s}$:  
$$  
F_{\text{air},2} = \left( \frac{10}{9} \right) (4)^2 = \frac{160}{9}  \text{N}, \quad F_{\text{net},2} = \frac{160}{9} + F_r.  
$$  
Power output: $P_2 = F_{\text{net},2} \cdot v_2 = \left( \frac{160}{9} + F_r \right) \cdot 4 = 100  \text{W}$.  

**Step 3: Solve for $F_r$.**  
$$  
4 \left( \frac{160}{9} + F_r \right) = 100 \implies \frac{640}{9} + 4F_r = 100 \implies 4F_r = 100 - \frac{640}{9} = \frac{900}{9} - \frac{640}{9} = \frac{260}{9}  
$$  
$$  
F_r = \frac{260}{9} \div 4 = \frac{260}{36} = \frac{65}{9}  \text{N}.  
$$  

**Step 4: Compute power at $v_1 = 6  \text{m/s}$.**  
Total resistive force at $v_1$:  
$$  
F_{\text{net},1} = F_{\text{air},1} + F_r = 40 + \frac{65}{9} = \frac{360}{9} + \frac{65}{9} = \frac{425}{9}  \text{N}.  
$$  
Power output:  
$$  
P_1 = F_{\text{net},1} \cdot v_1 = \frac{425}{9} \cdot 6 = \frac{425 \cdot 6}{9} = \frac{2550}{9} = \frac{850}{3}  \text{W}.  
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{850}{3}}$$

------
## Problem 3
Background:
Water pumps are essential in various real-world systems, such as irrigation, municipal water supply, and hydroelectric power generation. These systems often require lifting water against gravity from a lower reservoir to a higher storage point. The power needed for this process depends on the rate at which water is moved and the height it must be lifted. Understanding the minimum power requirement is crucial for designing efficient systems and conserving energy.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Relationship between work and gravitational potential energy: $W = mgh$
- Definition of average power: $P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}$
- Mass flow rate and its connection to energy transfer
- Conservation of energy principles in ideal mechanical systems

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects work-energy theorem to fluid dynamics, demonstrating how power calculations extend to continuous mass flow. It also reinforces the concept that power is the rate of energy transfer, linking mechanics to thermodynamics through efficiency considerations.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
In environmental engineering, these calculations determine energy requirements for water distribution networks. In sustainability studies, they help evaluate the carbon footprint of pumping systems. The principles also apply to mechanical engineering designs of pumps and hydraulic systems.

Real-World Applications:
1. Municipal water supply: Calculating power needs for pumping stations that move water to elevated storage tanks
2. Agriculture: Determining energy costs for irrigation systems that lift water from wells or canals
3. Renewable energy: Designing micro-hydro systems where water is pumped to higher reservoirs during off-peak hours for later power generation

Problem Statement:
A water pumping station lifts water from a reservoir to a storage tank located at height $h$ above the reservoir surface. The pump maintains a constant mass flow rate of $\dot{m}$ (mass per unit time). Assume ideal conditions: no frictional losses, incompressible fluid, and constant gravitational acceleration $g$. Derive an expression for the minimum mechanical power the pump must supply to sustain this operation. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $\dot{m}$, $g$, and $h$.

Note: The final answer must be a simplified symbolic expression. Use $\dot{m}$ for mass flow rate, $g$ for gravitational acceleration, and $h$ for height. Do not include any numerical values or units in your expression.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify energy transfer per unit mass**  
The work done to lift a mass $m$ to height $h$ against gravity equals its gravitational potential energy gain:  
$$W = mgh$$

**Step 2: Relate work to time interval**  
For a constant mass flow rate $\dot{m}$, the mass moved in time $\Delta t$ is:  
$$m = \dot{m} \Delta t$$  
Substitute into the work equation:  
$$W = (\dot{m} \Delta t) gh$$

**Step 3: Apply power definition**  
Average power is the work done per unit time:  
$$P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{W}{\Delta t} = \frac{(\dot{m} \Delta t) gh}{\Delta t}$$  

**Step 4: Simplify for minimum power**  
The $\Delta t$ terms cancel, yielding:  
$$P_{\text{min}} = \dot{m} g h$$  
This is the minimum power because ideal conditions (no friction, 100% efficiency) imply all energy is converted to potential energy without losses.  

**Key principle:** The derivation hinges on the power-energy relationship $P = \frac{dE}{dt}$, where $E$ is the gravitational potential energy of the water. The constant flow rate makes average power equivalent to instantaneous power in this system.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dot{m} g h}$$

------
## Problem 4
**Background:**  
In mechanical systems, power quantifies the rate at which work is done by a force. For an object moving along a straight line, the instantaneous power $P(t)$ delivered by a force $\vec{F}$ is given by the dot product $\vec{F} \cdot \vec{v}$, where $\vec{v}$ is the velocity vector. When $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{v}$ are parallel, this simplifies to $P(t) = F(t) \cdot v(t)$. Newton’s second law relates force to acceleration: $F(t) = m \cdot a(t)$, where $m$ is mass and $a(t)$ is acceleration. Since acceleration is the derivative of velocity $(a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt})$, velocity can be found by integrating acceleration with respect to time.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Definition of instantaneous power and its relationship to force and velocity.  
- Application of Newton’s second law to variable forces.  
- Integration of acceleration to determine velocity as a function of time.  
- Evaluation of power at a specific instant using derived expressions.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects kinematics (velocity, acceleration) with dynamics (force, mass) and work-energy concepts (power).  
- Reinforces calculus skills (integration) within a mechanical context.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Calculus:** Integration of polynomial functions to derive velocity from acceleration.  
- **Engineering:** Power calculations are critical in designing motors, engines, and mechanical systems with time-dependent forces.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Determining power output in vehicles during acceleration (e.g., rocket propulsion, electric cars).  
- Analyzing energy consumption in industrial machinery with variable loads.  

---

**Problem Statement:**  
An object of mass $m = 8  \text{kg}$ is initially at rest at $t = 0$. A variable force $F(t) = 12t^2  \text{N}$ (where $t$ is in seconds) acts on the object in the direction of motion. Assuming no other forces act on the object, derive the expression for the instantaneous power $P(t)$ delivered by this force. Use your derivation to compute the power at $t = 2  \text{s}$.  

Express your final answer as an exact numerical value in watts.

## Solution
**Step 1: Determine acceleration**  
Using Newton’s second law:  

$$
F(t) = m \cdot a(t)
$$
  
Substitute $F(t) = 12t^2$ and $m = 8  \text{kg}$:  

$$
12t^2 = 8 \cdot a(t)
$$
  
Solve for acceleration $a(t)$:  

$$
a(t) = \frac{12t^2}{8} = \frac{3}{2} t^2  \text{m/s}^2
$$
  

**Step 2: Integrate acceleration to find velocity**  
Acceleration is the derivative of velocity:  

$$
a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt}
$$
  
Integrate with respect to time:  

$$
v(t) = \int a(t)  dt = \int \frac{3}{2} t^2  dt
$$
  
The antiderivative is:  

$$
v(t) = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{t^3}{3} + C = \frac{1}{2} t^3 + C
$$
  
Since the object starts from rest at $t = 0$:  

$$
v(0) = \frac{1}{2} (0)^3 + C = 0 \implies C = 0
$$
  
Thus, the velocity function is:  

$$
v(t) = \frac{1}{2} t^3  \text{m/s}
$$
  

**Step 3: Derive the instantaneous power**  
Power is defined as:  

$$
P(t) = F(t) \cdot v(t)
$$
  
Substitute $F(t) = 12t^2$ and $v(t) = \frac{1}{2} t^3$:  

$$
P(t) = (12t^2) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2} t^3\right) = 12t^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} t^3 = 6t^5  \text{W}
$$
  

**Step 4: Evaluate power at $t = 2  \text{s}$**  

$$
P(2) = 6 \cdot (2)^5 = 6 \cdot 32 = 192  \text{W}
$$
  

The power delivered by the force at $t = 2  \text{s}$ is $192  \text{W}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{192}$$

# Kirchhoff's current rule (junction rule)

## Problem 0
**Background**  
In electrical circuits, Kirchhoff's current rule (also known as the junction rule) is a fundamental principle derived from the conservation of electric charge. It states that the algebraic sum of all currents entering and leaving a junction must be zero. In simpler terms, the total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving it. This rule is essential for analyzing complex circuits, ensuring that charge is neither created nor destroyed at any point.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Application of Kirchhoff's current rule at a single junction.  
- Solving for an unknown current using algebraic summation.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to Ohm's law (relating voltage, current, and resistance) and Kirchhoff's voltage rule (loop rule), which together form the basis for circuit analysis in electromagnetism.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The conservation principle mirrors concepts in fluid dynamics (conservation of mass in pipe networks) and thermodynamics (conservation of energy in closed systems).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Kirchhoff's rules are used to design and troubleshoot electrical grids, electronic devices (e.g., smartphones), and power distribution systems, ensuring stable current flow and preventing circuit failures.  

---

**Problem Statement**  
Consider a junction in an electrical circuit where two currents enter: $I_1 = 5  \text{A}$ and $I_2 = 3  \text{A}$. A third current $I_3$ leaves the junction, while a fourth current $I_4 = 2  \text{A}$ *also leaves* the junction to an external branch. Determine the current $I_3$ using Kirchhoff's current rule.  

Express your answer in amperes (A) as an exact fraction. Provide only the numerical value.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply Kirchhoff's current rule**  
Kirchhoff's current rule states that the sum of currents entering a junction equals the sum of currents leaving it. Identify the directions:  
- Currents entering: $I_1 = 5  \text{A}$, $I_2 = 3  \text{A}$.  
- Currents leaving: $I_3$, $I_4 = 2  \text{A}$.  

**Step 2: Set up the equation**  
Sum of entering currents = Sum of leaving currents:  
$$  
I_1 + I_2 = I_3 + I_4  
$$  
Substitute the known values:  
$$  
5 + 3 = I_3 + 2  
$$  
Simplify:  
$$  
8 = I_3 + 2  
$$  

**Step 3: Solve for $I_3$**  
Isolate $I_3$:  
$$  
I_3 = 8 - 2  
$$  
$$  
I_3 = 6  
$$  
Thus, the current $I_3$ is $6  \text{A}$.

## Problem 1
Background:
In a direct current (DC) circuit analysis for a power grid model, three junctions—X, Y, and Z—interconnect via conductors. The following instantaneous currents are observed:
- Junction X:  
  - 120 A enters from a main power source.  
  - 30 A leaves toward junction Y.  
  - An unknown current $I_A$ leaves toward a substation.  
  - An unknown current $I_X$ leaves toward junction Z.  
- Junction Y:  
  - 30 A enters from junction X.  
  - An unknown current $I_B$ leaves toward a substation.  
  - An unknown current $I_Y$ leaves toward junction Z.  
- Junction Z:  
  - $I_X$ enters from junction X.  
  - $I_Y$ enters from junction Y.  
  - 40 A leaves toward a substation.  
  - 20 A leaves toward another substation.  
A critical operational constraint states that $I_A = 10I_Y$. Kirchhoff's current rule (junction rule) governs this system, requiring the algebraic sum of currents entering any junction to equal the algebraic sum of currents leaving it. This rule reflects conservation of electric charge.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Application of Kirchhoff's current rule (junction rule) to multiple interconnected junctions.
- Formulation and solution of a system of linear equations derived from charge conservation.
- Algebraic manipulation including substitution and simplification.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- This problem extends the junction rule to networked systems, reinforcing core principles of circuit analysis. It connects to circuit topology, node analysis, and lays groundwork for mesh analysis in advanced electronics.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- The power grid model links to electrical engineering (energy distribution systems). The equation-solving approach applies to linear algebra in mathematics and system modeling in computer science.

Real-World Applications:
- Engineers use Kirchhoff's rules to balance loads in power grids, preventing overloads. For example, in urban electricity distribution, current imbalances can cause blackouts; such analysis ensures stability.

Task:
Apply Kirchhoff's current rule at junctions X, Y, and Z to derive a system of equations. Incorporate the constraint $I_A = 10I_Y$ and solve for $I_X$. Express $I_X$ in amperes (A) as an exact fraction in simplest form.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply Kirchhoff's current rule at junction X.**  
Currents entering: 120 A.  
Currents leaving: $I_A + 30 + I_X$.  
The rule gives:  

$$
120 = I_A + 30 + I_X
$$
  
Rearrange to:  

$$
I_A + I_X = 90 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
$$


**Step 2: Apply Kirchhoff's current rule at junction Y.**  
Currents entering: 30 A.  
Currents leaving: $I_B + I_Y$.  
The rule gives:  

$$
30 = I_B + I_Y \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
$$
  
*Note: $I_B$ is not needed for $I_X$, so we proceed without it.*

**Step 3: Apply Kirchhoff's current rule at junction Z.**  
Currents entering: $I_X + I_Y$.  
Currents leaving: 40 + 20 = 60 A.  
The rule gives:  

$$
I_X + I_Y = 60 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
$$


**Step 4: Incorporate the constraint $I_A = 10I_Y$.**  
Substitute $I_A = 10I_Y$ into Equation 1:  

$$
10I_Y + I_X = 90 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
$$


**Step 5: Solve the system of equations.**  
From Equation 3:  

$$
I_X = 60 - I_Y \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
$$
  
Substitute Equation 5 into Equation 4:  

$$
10I_Y + (60 - I_Y) = 90
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
9I_Y + 60 = 90
$$
  

$$
9I_Y = 30
$$
  

$$
I_Y = \frac{30}{9} = \frac{10}{3}  \text{A}
$$
  
Substitute $I_Y = \frac{10}{3}$ into Equation 5:  

$$
I_X = 60 - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{180}{3} - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{170}{3}  \text{A}
$$


**Verification:**  
- With $I_Y = \frac{10}{3}$ A, constraint gives $I_A = 10 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{100}{3}$ A.  
- Equation 1: $\frac{100}{3} + \frac{170}{3} = \frac{270}{3} = 90$, holds.  
- Equation 3: $\frac{170}{3} + \frac{10}{3} = \frac{180}{3} = 60$, holds.  

The current $I_X$ is $\frac{170}{3}$ A.

## Answer
\boxed{\dfrac{170}{3}}

## Problem 2
**Background:**  
Kirchhoff's current rule (junction rule) is a fundamental principle in circuit theory, stating that the algebraic sum of currents entering any junction in an electrical circuit must equal zero. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of electric charge. In practical terms, it means the total current flowing into a junction equals the total current flowing out. This rule is essential for analyzing complex circuits in devices ranging from household electronics to advanced communication systems.

**Problem Statement:**  
In a solar-powered drone's battery management system, a critical junction connects four branches. Currents from two solar panels *enter* the junction with values of $1.5  \text{A}$ and $2.5  \text{A}$. Currents *leaving* the junction power the drone's navigation system ($0.8  \text{A}$) and a data transmitter ($I$). Determine $I$, the current supplied to the transmitter, using Kirchhoff's current rule.  
Express $I$ in amperes (A) and provide **only the numerical value** in your answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: State Kirchhoff's current rule.**  
The sum of currents entering a junction equals the sum of currents leaving it.  

**Step 2: Identify entering and leaving currents.**  
- Entering currents: $1.5  \text{A}$ and $2.5  \text{A}$ (from solar panels).  
- Leaving currents: $0.8  \text{A}$ (to navigation system) and $I$ (to transmitter).  

**Step 3: Apply the junction rule.**  
Total entering current = Total leaving current:  
$$  
1.5 + 2.5 = 0.8 + I  
$$  

**Step 4: Solve for $I$.**  
Simplify the equation:  
$$  
4.0 = 0.8 + I  
$$  
Subtract $0.8$ from both sides:  
$$  
I = 4.0 - 0.8 = 3.2  
$$  
Thus, the current to the transmitter is $3.2  \text{A}$.

## Problem 3
Background: Kirchhoff's current rule, also known as the junction rule, is a fundamental principle in circuit analysis. It states that the algebraic sum of currents entering any junction (node) in an electrical circuit must equal zero, which is equivalent to saying the total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving it. This rule arises from the conservation of electric charge and is essential for analyzing parallel circuits where current splits into multiple branches.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Application of Kirchhoff's current rule at a junction.
- Setting up and solving equations based on current conservation.
- Interpretation of current direction and magnitude in parallel branches.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- This rule connects to series-parallel circuit analysis, where voltage and current division principles are applied.
- It relates to Ohm's law when combined with resistance values to determine unknown currents or voltages.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Physics: Conservation laws (charge) underpin Kirchhoff's rules.
- Mathematics: Solving linear equations with one unknown.

Real-World Applications:
- Household electrical systems: Current distribution in parallel wiring for outlets and appliances.
- Electronics design: Ensuring current limits are not exceeded in integrated circuits and PCB layouts.
- Automotive systems: Diagnosing current paths in parallel lighting circuits.

Problem:
A portable power station supplies DC current to three parallel-connected devices: a drone charger, a laptop, and a LED array. At the junction where the current splits, the total current from the power station is $I_{\text{total}} = 9  \text{A}$. The current to the drone charger is measured at $2  \text{A}$, and the current to the laptop is $3  \text{A}$, both flowing away from the junction. Using Kirchhoff's current rule, determine the current (in amperes) supplied to the LED array. Express your answer as an integer or simplified fraction.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply Kirchhoff's current rule**  
At the junction, the total current entering equals the total current leaving. The total current from the power station enters the junction, so it is $+9  \text{A}$. The currents to the drone charger and laptop leave the junction, so they are $-2  \text{A}$ and $-3  \text{A}$ respectively. Let $I_x$ be the current to the LED array. The current rule gives:  

$$
+9  \text{A} - 2  \text{A} - 3  \text{A} - I_x = 0
$$

where the negative signs for $I_x$ assume it leaves the junction (standard for parallel branches).

**Step 2: Simplify the equation**  
Combine known terms:  

$$
9 - 2 - 3 - I_x = 0 \implies 4 - I_x = 0
$$


**Step 3: Solve for $I_x$**  
Isolate $I_x$:  

$$
I_x = 4  \text{A}
$$


**Verification**:  
Total entering current = $9  \text{A}$.  
Total leaving currents = $2  \text{A} + 3  \text{A} + 4  \text{A} = 9  \text{A}$.  
This satisfies Kirchhoff's current rule.

# magnetic dipole moments

## Problem 0
**Background**  
Magnetic dipole moments are crucial in understanding how current-carrying loops interact with magnetic fields, with applications in devices like electric motors and MRI machines. For any planar loop, the magnetic dipole moment $\vec{\mu}$ quantifies the loop's tendency to align with an external magnetic field. Its magnitude depends on the current $I$ and the enclosed area $A$, while its direction follows the right-hand rule: when fingers curl in the current's direction, the thumb points along $\vec{\mu}$.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Definition of magnetic dipole moment for a planar current loop.  
- Vector superposition of magnetic moments.  
- Application of the right-hand rule to determine direction.  
- Magnitude calculation for composite systems.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to vector addition in electromagnetism, similar to superposition principles for electric fields and forces. It also reinforces torque concepts ($\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The net dipole moment is analogous to the net magnetic moment in atomic physics (electron orbits) and is used in engineering to design efficient electromagnets or antenna arrays.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Concentric loops model components in Helmholtz coils (used for uniform magnetic fields) and magnetic sensors in navigation systems.  

**Problem**  
Two concentric circular loops lie in the $xy$-plane centered at the origin. The larger loop has radius $R$ and carries current $I$ counterclockwise (viewed from $+z$). The smaller loop has radius $r$ and carries current $i$ clockwise (viewed from $+z$).  
1. Derive the net magnetic dipole moment vector $\vec{\mu}_{\text{net}}$ in terms of $I$, $i$, $R$, $r$, and the unit vector $\hat{k}$.  
2. Given $R = 0.2  \text{m}$, $r = 0.1  \text{m}$, $I = 3  \text{A}$, and $i = 2  \text{A}$, compute the magnitude of $\vec{\mu}_{\text{net}}$ in $\text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2$.  
**Express the numerical answer rounded to three decimal places.**

## Solution
**Step 1: Dipole moment of the larger loop**  
- Area: $A_R = \pi R^2$.  
- Current direction (counterclockwise) implies $\vec{A}_R$ points along $+\hat{k}$ (right-hand rule).  
- Dipole moment:  
  
$$
  \vec{\mu}_R = I \vec{A}_R = I (\pi R^2) \hat{k}.
  $$


**Step 2: Dipole moment of the smaller loop**  
- Area: $A_r = \pi r^2$.  
- Current direction (clockwise) implies $\vec{A}_r$ points along $-\hat{k}$ (right-hand rule).  
- Dipole moment:  
  
$$
  \vec{\mu}_r = i \vec{A}_r = i (\pi r^2) (-\hat{k}) = -i \pi r^2 \hat{k}.
  $$


**Step 3: Net dipole moment**  
- Vector superposition:  
  
$$
  \vec{\mu}_{\text{net}} = \vec{\mu}_R + \vec{\mu}_r = \pi R^2 I \hat{k} - \pi r^2 i \hat{k} = \pi (I R^2 - i r^2) \hat{k}.
  $$


**Step 4: Magnitude calculation**  
- Substitute values: $R = 0.2  \text{m}$, $r = 0.1  \text{m}$, $I = 3  \text{A}$, $i = 2  \text{A}$:  
  
$$
  I R^2 = 3 \times (0.2)^2 = 3 \times 0.04 = 0.12,
  $$

  
$$
  i r^2 = 2 \times (0.1)^2 = 2 \times 0.01 = 0.02,
  $$

  
$$
  I R^2 - i r^2 = 0.12 - 0.02 = 0.10.
  $$

- Magnitude:  
  
$$
  |\vec{\mu}_{\text{net}}| = \left| \pi \times 0.10 \right| = 0.1\pi.
  $$

- Numerical evaluation: $0.1\pi \approx 0.1 \times 3.1415926535 = 0.31415926535$.  
- Rounded to three decimal places: $0.314$.

## Problem 1
**Background:**  
In a physics laboratory, students investigate the behavior of a magnetic dipole in a uniform magnetic field. The dipole is modeled as a small rectangular current loop with $N$ turns, each of area $A$. The loop carries a current $I$, and its magnetic dipole moment $\mu$ is defined as $\mu = N I A$. When placed in a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, the dipole experiences a torque due to the interaction between the field and the magnetic moment. This torque is central to devices like electric motors and galvanometers, where electrical energy converts to mechanical rotation. The angle $\theta$ represents the angle between the dipole moment vector $\mathbf{\mu}$ (directed normal to the loop's plane) and the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor.  
2. Torque as a vector product of force and lever arm.  
3. Magnetic dipole moment and its relationship to torque.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- This problem links the Lorentz force (on moving charges) to macroscopic torque on a current loop, bridging electromagnetism and rotational dynamics.  
- It extends to topics like magnetic materials (e.g., paramagnetism) and electromagnetic induction.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Engineering:** Design of electric motors, generators, and precision instruments (e.g., galvanometers).  
- **Technology:** Applications in MRI machines, which rely on magnetic dipole interactions.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- **Electric Motors:** Convert electrical energy to mechanical torque via dipole-field interactions.  
- **Galvanometers:** Measure small currents by detecting torque-induced rotation of a coil in a magnetic field.  

**Problem:**  
Derive an expression for the magnitude of the torque $\tau$ on a rectangular current loop with $N$ turns, each of area $A$, carrying current $I$, placed in a uniform magnetic field $B$. The angle between the magnetic dipole moment vector $\mathbf{\mu}$ and the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ is $\theta$. Start from the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire. Express the final torque $\tau$ in terms of $\mu$, $B$, and $\theta$.  

**Important Instructions:**  
- Use $\mu$ for the magnetic dipole moment, $B$ for the magnetic field magnitude, and $\theta$ for the angle.  
- Express the final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $\mu$, $B$, and $\theta$.  
- Use $\sin$ for the sine function.  
- The angle $\theta$ is in radians, but the expression holds for any unit if $\sin$ is consistent.

## Solution
**Step 1: Force on the loop's sides**  
Consider one turn of the rectangular loop (length $l$, width $w$, area $A = lw$). The loop is oriented such that its normal (and thus $\mathbf{\mu}$) makes an angle $\theta$ with $\mathbf{B}$. The axis of rotation is parallel to the width $w$. The two sides of length $l$ are perpendicular to the axis and experience magnetic forces. The current in these sides is perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$, so the force magnitude on each side is:  

$$
F = I l B,
$$
  
since the angle between current and $\mathbf{B}$ is $90^\circ$ ($\sin 90^\circ = 1$). The forces on opposite sides are equal and opposite, forming a couple.  

**Step 2: Lever arm and torque for one turn**  
The forces act at a distance $w$ apart. When the loop is rotated by $\theta$ relative to $\mathbf{B}$, the effective lever arm (perpendicular distance between the lines of force) is $w \sin \theta$. Thus, the torque magnitude for one turn is:  

$$
\tau_{\text{one turn}} = (\text{force}) \times (\text{lever arm}) = (I l B) \times (w \sin \theta) = I (l w) B \sin \theta = I A B \sin \theta.
$$
  

**Step 3: Torque for N turns**  
For $N$ turns, the force on each side is $N$ times larger due to the total current. The torque becomes:  

$$
\tau = N \times (I A B \sin \theta) = N I A B \sin \theta.
$$
  

**Step 4: Substitute magnetic dipole moment**  
The magnetic dipole moment is $\mu = N I A$. Substituting this expression:  

$$
\tau = \mu B \sin \theta.
$$
  
This is the magnitude of the torque on the dipole.

## Answer
$$
\boxed{\mu B \sin \theta}
$$

## Problem 2
**Background:**  
Magnetic dipoles, such as those found in bar magnets, atomic nuclei, or current loops, experience torque and potential energy when placed in an external magnetic field. This behavior is fundamental to technologies like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and electric motors. In MRI, hydrogen nuclei (acting as magnetic dipoles) align with a strong external field, and their potential energy differences enable detailed imaging. The potential energy depends on the orientation of the dipole moment relative to the magnetic field.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Torque on a magnetic dipole in a uniform magnetic field.  
- Relationship between work done by torque and potential energy.  
- Integration to compute work for finite angular displacement.  
- Conservative forces and energy minimization principles.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
Connects to rotational dynamics (torque, angular work), energy conservation, and electromagnetism (magnetic fields, dipole interactions).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Relevant to medical physics (MRI technology), materials science (magnetic materials), and chemistry (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
MRI scanners use superconducting magnets to create fields up to 3 Tesla. Hydrogen nuclei in the body align with this field, and their energy states are manipulated via radio waves to produce diagnostic images.  

**Problem:**  
A magnetic dipole with moment $\vec{\mu}$ is placed in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$. The dipole is initially oriented such that the angle between $\vec{\mu}$ and $\vec{B}$ is $\phi = \pi/2$ radians (perpendicular). Due to the torque, it rotates to align with the field ($\phi = 0$).  

The magnitude of the torque on the dipole is given by:  
$$ \tau = -\mu B \sin\phi, $$  
where the negative sign indicates the torque acts to reduce $\phi$. The work $W$ done by the magnetic field during rotation is defined as:  
$$ W = \int_{\phi_i}^{\phi_f} \tau  d\phi. $$  

(a) Derive an expression for the work $W$ done by the magnetic field when the dipole rotates from $\phi_i = \pi/2$ to $\phi_f = 0$.  
(b) The potential energy $U$ of the dipole is defined as $U(\phi_f) - U(\phi_i) = -W$. Given $U(\pi/2) = 0$, derive the general expression for $U(\phi)$.  
(c) Find the potential energy $U(0)$ when the dipole is fully aligned with $\vec{B}$.  

Express the final answer for part (c) symbolically in terms of $\mu$ and $B$.

## Solution
**(a) Work done by the magnetic field:**  
The work $W$ is computed by integrating the torque:  
$$ W = \int_{\pi/2}^{0} \tau  d\phi = \int_{\pi/2}^{0} (-\mu B \sin\phi)  d\phi. $$  
Factor out constants:  
$$ W = -\mu B \int_{\pi/2}^{0} \sin\phi  d\phi. $$  
The antiderivative of $\sin\phi$ is $-\cos\phi$, so:  
$$ W = -\mu B \left[ -\cos\phi \right]_{\pi/2}^{0} = \mu B \left[ \cos\phi \right]_{\pi/2}^{0}. $$  
Evaluate at limits:  
$$ \cos(0) - \cos(\pi/2) = 1 - 0 = 1. $$  
Thus,  
$$ W = \mu B \cdot 1 = \mu B. $$  

**(b) General potential energy expression:**  
By definition, the change in potential energy is:  
$$ U(\phi_f) - U(\phi_i) = -W. $$  
Substitute $\phi_i = \pi/2$, $\phi_f = \phi$, and $U(\pi/2) = 0$:  
$$ U(\phi) - 0 = -W_{\pi/2 \rightarrow \phi}, $$  
where $W_{\pi/2 \rightarrow \phi}$ is the work from $\pi/2$ to $\phi$. Using the integral in (a) but with upper limit $\phi$:  
$$ W_{\pi/2 \rightarrow \phi} = \mu B \left[ \cos\phi \right]_{\pi/2}^{\phi} = \mu B (\cos\phi - \cos(\pi/2)) = \mu B \cos\phi. $$  
Thus,  
$$ U(\phi) = -W_{\pi/2 \rightarrow \phi} = -\mu B \cos\phi. $$  

**(c) Potential energy when aligned ($\phi = 0$):**  
Substitute $\phi = 0$ into the expression from (b):  
$$ U(0) = -\mu B \cos(0) = -\mu B \cdot 1 = -\mu B. $$

## Problem 3
**Background**  
In electromagnetism, a current-carrying loop generates a magnetic dipole moment, a fundamental vector quantity that characterizes its magnetic strength and orientation. The magnitude of this moment depends on the loop's geometry and current. Engineers and physicists often optimize coil shapes (e.g., in MRI machines or electric motors) to maximize magnetic effects for a given wire length. This problem explores how geometry influences efficiency by comparing two fundamental loop configurations.

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Definition of magnetic dipole moment ($\mu = I \cdot A$) for a planar current loop.  
2. Geometric relationships between perimeter and area for circles and squares.  
3. Dimensional analysis and ratio comparison of physical quantities.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
- Relates to torque calculations ($\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$) in uniform magnetic fields.  
- Extends to the Biot-Savart law for magnetic fields along symmetry axes.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Geometry**: Perimeter-to-area optimization in constrained systems.  
- **Engineering**: Coil design trade-offs between magnetic strength and material costs.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Efficient electromagnet design (e.g., particle accelerators).  
- Miniaturized sensors where wire length is limited (e.g., biomedical devices).  

**Problem Statement**  
A physicist constructs two wire loops from identical wires of length $L$. One loop is circular with radius $R$, and the other is square with side length $S$. Both carry a steady current $I$.  
- Derive symbolic expressions for the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment $\mu_{\text{circle}}$ and $\mu_{\text{square}}$.  
- Determine the ratio $\frac{\mu_{\text{circle}}}{\mu_{\text{square}}}$.  

**Constraints and Instructions**  
- Express all answers symbolically using $I$, $L$, and mathematical constants.  
- The final ratio must be simplified to a single fractional expression.  
- For trigonometric functions, use radians.  
- Explicitly state all geometric relations and physical principles used.

## Solution
**Step 1: Relate perimeter to geometric parameters**  
Both loops have the same wire length $L$:  
- **Circle**: Perimeter $L = 2\pi R \implies R = \frac{L}{2\pi}$.  
- **Square**: Perimeter $L = 4S \implies S = \frac{L}{4}$.  

**Step 2: Derive loop areas**  
- **Circle area**: $A_{\text{circle}} = \pi R^2 = \pi \left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^2 = \frac{L^2}{4\pi}$.  
- **Square area**: $A_{\text{square}} = S^2 = \left(\frac{L}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{L^2}{16}$.  

**Step 3: Apply magnetic dipole moment formula**  
The magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment is $\mu = I \cdot A$ for a planar loop:  
- $\mu_{\text{circle}} = I \cdot A_{\text{circle}} = I \cdot \frac{L^2}{4\pi}$.  
- $\mu_{\text{square}} = I \cdot A_{\text{square}} = I \cdot \frac{L^2}{16}$.  

**Step 4: Compute the ratio**  

$$
\frac{\mu_{\text{circle}}}{\mu_{\text{square}}} = \frac{I \cdot \frac{L^2}{4\pi}}{I \cdot \frac{L^2}{16}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4\pi}}{\frac{1}{16}} = \frac{16}{4\pi} = \frac{4}{\pi}.
$$
  

**Key Principles**  
- The dipole moment scales with loop area for fixed current.  
- Geometric efficiency: A circle encloses more area than a square for the same perimeter, yielding a larger $\mu$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{4}{\pi}}$$

## Problem 4
**Background:**
Magnetic dipole moments arise from current loops or intrinsic magnetic properties of particles. When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, a dipole experiences a net force due to the spatial variation of the field strength. This phenomenon is critical in applications like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where gradient fields manipulate spins, and in magnetic tweezers used for nanoscale force measurements in biophysics. The force depends on the dipole's orientation relative to the field gradient.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**
1. Relationship between magnetic force on a dipole and the gradient of the magnetic field.
2. Derivation of force from the potential energy expression $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$.
3. Vector calculus: Gradient operator applied to scalar products.

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**
- Connects to the concept of torque on a dipole in uniform fields (where force is zero).
- Extends to energy conservation in electromagnetic systems (e.g., particle motion in magnetic traps).

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**
- Physics/Chemistry: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy uses field gradients to encode spatial information.
- Engineering: Magnetic levitation systems rely on controlled field gradients for stable suspension.

**Real-World Applications:**
- **MRI scanners:** Gradient coils create field variations to spatially encode signals for imaging.
- **Magnetic separation:** Industrial processes separate materials using field gradients (e.g., mining).

**Problem Statement:**
A magnetic dipole with moment magnitude $m$ is aligned parallel to a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ that varies spatially. The field has a gradient $\frac{\partial B}{\partial x}$ along the $x$-axis, where $B$ is the magnitude of $\vec{B}$. Starting from the potential energy $U = -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$, derive the $x$-component of the force on the dipole. Then, compute the force magnitude when $m = 0.6  \text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2$ and $\frac{\partial B}{\partial x} = 0.8  \text{T/m}$.  
**Express your answer in newtons and provide only the numerical value, rounded to two significant digits.**

## Solution
**Step 1: Express potential energy.**  
For a dipole aligned with the field, $\vec{m} \parallel \vec{B}$, so:  
$$ U = -m B \quad \text{(scalar form)} $$  
where $B$ is the magnitude of $\vec{B}$ and depends on position.

**Step 2: Relate force to potential energy.**  
Force is the negative gradient of potential energy:  
$$ \vec{F} = -\nabla U. $$  
The $x$-component is:  
$$ F_x = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}. $$

**Step 3: Substitute $U$ and differentiate.**  
Substitute $U = -m B$:  
$$ F_x = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (-m B) = m \frac{\partial B}{\partial x}. $$  
Here, $\frac{\partial B}{\partial x}$ is the gradient of the field magnitude along $x$.

**Step 4: Compute numerical force.**  
Given $m = 0.6  \text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2$ and $\frac{\partial B}{\partial x} = 0.8  \text{T/m}$:  
$$ F_x = (0.6) \times (0.8) = 0.48  \text{N}. $$  

**Step 5: Round to two significant digits.**  
$0.48$ has two significant digits. No further rounding is needed.  

**Unit verification:**  
- $\text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2 \times \text{T/m} = \text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2 \times \frac{\text{N}}{\text{A} \cdot \text{m}} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{m}} = \text{N}$ (since $\text{T} = \text{N}/(\text{A} \cdot \text{m})$).  
The units are consistent.

## Answer
$$\boxed{0.48}$$

## Problem 5
**Background**  
Magnetic dipoles are fundamental in understanding phenomena from atomic-scale interactions to macroscopic devices like electric motors and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines. When a dipole is rotated in an external magnetic field, work is done by an external agent to overcome the magnetic torque. This process involves converting mechanical work into potential energy stored in the dipole-field system.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. **Torque on a magnetic dipole**: The torque $\vec{\tau}$ experienced by a dipole moment $\vec{\mu}$ in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is $\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$.  
2. **Work done by a torque**: The infinitesimal work $dW$ done by an external torque during rotation is $dW = \tau_{\text{ext}}  d\theta$.  
3. **Integration of angular work**: Total work is obtained by integrating $dW$ over the angular displacement, requiring consistent units (radians).  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to rotational dynamics (torque and work) and energy conservation in magnetic systems. It extends the concept of mechanical work to electromagnetic contexts, emphasizing the universality of energy principles.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Engineering**: The work-energy relationship is crucial in designing motors and generators, where magnetic alignment affects efficiency.  
- **Medical Physics**: MRI relies on manipulating dipole orientations; the work calculated here relates to the energy input needed for such reorientations.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Galvanometers**: Measure current by rotating a coil (magnetic dipole) in a field; the work done correlates with deflection.  
- **Magnetic Storage**: Hard drives rotate magnetic domains (dipoles) to write data, requiring precise energy calculations.  

**Problem Statement**  
A magnetic dipole with moment magnitude $\mu$ is placed in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$. The dipole is initially aligned with the field ($\theta_i = 0^\circ$). An external agent slowly rotates it to a perpendicular orientation ($\theta_f = 90^\circ$). Derive an expression for the work $W$ done by the external agent during this rotation. Start from the torque expression and integrate to find $W$. Express your final answer symbolically in terms of $\mu$ and $B$.  

**Note**:  
- Use radians for angular measure in the integral. Convert angular limits as needed.  
- Express the final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $\mu$ and $B$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Express the torque on the dipole**  
The torque $\vec{\tau}$ on a magnetic dipole is given by the cross product:  

$$
\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}.
$$
  
The magnitude of the torque is:  

$$
\tau = \mu B \sin\theta,
$$
  
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{\mu}$ and $\vec{B}$.  

**Step 2: Define the external torque**  
To rotate the dipole quasi-statically (without kinetic energy), the external agent must apply a torque $\tau_{\text{ext}}$ that balances the magnetic torque:  

$$
\tau_{\text{ext}} = \mu B \sin\theta.
$$
  

**Step 3: Relate work to torque**  
The infinitesimal work $dW$ done by $\tau_{\text{ext}}$ for an infinitesimal rotation $d\theta$ is:  

$$
dW = \tau_{\text{ext}}  d\theta = \mu B \sin\theta  d\theta.
$$
  

**Step 4: Integrate to find total work**  
Convert angular limits from degrees to radians:  
- $\theta_i = 0^\circ = 0$ radians,  
- $\theta_f = 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2}$ radians.  

Integrate $dW$ from $\theta = 0$ to $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$:

# magnetic force on current-carrying wires

## Problem 0
**Background**  
Magnetic forces on current-carrying wires are fundamental in electromagnetism, with applications in devices like electric motors and loudspeakers. This problem explores a non-straight wire configuration to deepen understanding beyond basic straight-wire cases. A wire bent into a circular arc experiences forces that vary in direction along its length, requiring vector integration to find the net force.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Magnetic force on a current-carrying wire segment: $d\vec{F} = I \, d\vec{l} \times \vec{B}$.  
2. Vector integration over a parametrized curve.  
3. Symmetry principles in physics.  
4. Trigonometric functions in vector decomposition.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects the Lorentz force law to calculus-based physics, illustrating how continuous charge distributions (via current) respond to fields. It reinforces concepts from vector calculus, such as line integrals and cross products, which are also used in electromagnetism for Gauss's and Ampère's laws.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The integration techniques and coordinate geometry link to mathematics, particularly parametric equations and definite integrals. Engineering applications include designing curved conductors in electromagnets or magnetic sensors.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Curved wires are common in electromechanical devices. For example, arc-shaped coils are used in galvanometers to measure small currents via magnetic deflection, and in particle accelerators to steer charged-particle beams.  

**Problem Statement**  
A wire is bent into a circular arc of radius $R$ that subtends an angle $2\alpha$ (where $0 < \alpha \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$) and carries a steady current $I$. The arc lies in the $xy$-plane, centered at the origin, and extends symmetrically from $\theta = -\alpha$ to $\theta = \alpha$, where $\theta$ is the angular position measured from the positive $x$-axis. A uniform magnetic field $\vec{B} = B \hat{x}$ is applied (aligned with the $x$-axis). Derive an expression for the magnitude of the net magnetic force on the entire arc.  

**Requirements**  
- Use the parameters $I$, $B$, $R$, and $\alpha$ (in radians).  
- Express the magnitude of the net force as a simplified symbolic expression.  
- Angles in trigonometric functions must be in radians and left unevaluated (e.g., $\sin \alpha$, not $\sin(0.5)$).

## Solution
### Step 1: Force on an infinitesimal wire segment  
Consider a segment $d\vec{l}$ at angular position $\theta$. The position vector is:  
$$\vec{r}(\theta) = R \cos \theta  \hat{x} + R \sin \theta  \hat{y}.$$  
The tangential direction (path of current) is given by the derivative:  
$$\frac{d\vec{r}}{d\theta} = -R \sin \theta  \hat{x} + R \cos \theta  \hat{y}.$$  
Thus, the length element is:  
$$d\vec{l} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{d\theta} d\theta = (-R \sin \theta  \hat{x} + R \cos \theta  \hat{y})  d\theta.$$  

The magnetic force on this segment is:  
$$d\vec{F} = I  d\vec{l} \times \vec{B}.$$  
Substitute $\vec{B} = B \hat{x}$:  
$$d\vec{F} = I \left[ (-R \sin \theta  \hat{x} + R \cos \theta  \hat{y}) \times (B \hat{x}) \right] d\theta.$$  

### Step 2: Compute the cross product  
Using the cross product properties:  
- $\hat{x} \times \hat{x} = 0$,  
- $\hat{y} \times \hat{x} = -\hat{z}$,  
we get:  
$$d\vec{F} = I \left[ (-R \sin \theta)(B) (\hat{x} \times \hat{x}) + (R \cos \theta)(B) (\hat{y} \times \hat{x}) \right] d\theta = I \left[ 0 + R B \cos \theta (-\hat{z}) \right] d\theta.$$  
Simplify:  
$$d\vec{F} = -I B R \cos \theta  \hat{z}  d\theta.$$  

### Step 3: Integrate over the arc  
Integrate from $\theta = -\alpha$ to $\theta = \alpha$:  
$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \int_{-\alpha}^{\alpha} d\vec{F} = -I B R \hat{z} \int_{-\alpha}^{\alpha} \cos \theta  d\theta.$$  
The integral is:  
$$\int_{-\alpha}^{\alpha} \cos \theta  d\theta = \left[ \sin \theta \right]_{-\alpha}^{\alpha} = \sin \alpha - \sin(-\alpha) = \sin \alpha - (-\sin \alpha) = 2 \sin \alpha.$$  
Thus:  
$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = -I B R (2 \sin \alpha) \hat{z} = -2 I B R \sin \alpha  \hat{z}.$$  

### Step 4: Magnitude of the net force  
The magnitude is the absolute value of the $z$-component:  
$$|\vec{F}_{\text{net}}| = \left| -2 I B R \sin \alpha \right| = 2 I B R \sin \alpha.$$  
(Since $\alpha \in (0, \pi/2]$, $\sin \alpha > 0$.)

## Answer
$$\boxed{2 I B R \sin \alpha}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
In electromagnetism, a current-carrying wire generates a magnetic field. When two parallel wires carry currents, they interact via magnetic forces—attractive if currents are parallel and repulsive if antiparallel. This principle underpins devices like electric motors, relays, and magnetic levitation systems. The force per unit length between wires depends on current magnitudes, separation distance, and the permeability of free space ($\mu_0$).

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Magnetic field magnitude due to an infinite straight current-carrying wire.  
2. Force on a current-carrying wire in an external magnetic field.  
3. Vector nature of magnetic force (right-hand rule for direction).  
4. Superposition principle for magnetic fields.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects the Biot-Savart law (magnetic field of a wire) and the Lorentz force law (force on a current). It extends to Ampère's law for magnetic fields and stability analysis in parallel-wire configurations.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Engineering: Design of power transmission lines (force calculations prevent sagging/clashing).  
Materials Science: Stress analysis on conductors under electromagnetic loads.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Magnetic levitation (Maglev) trains use repulsive forces for frictionless motion.  
- Circuit breakers exploit repulsive forces to separate contacts during overloads.  

**Problem Statement**  
Two infinitely long, straight, parallel wires are separated by a distance $d = 8  \text{cm}$. The top wire carries a current $I_1 = 5  \text{A}$ to the right, and the bottom wire carries $I_2 = 3  \text{A}$ to the left.  

1. Derive an expression for the magnetic field $\vec{B_1}$ produced by the top wire at the location of the bottom wire.  
2. Derive an expression for the force per unit length ($\vec{F}/L$) exerted by $\vec{B_1}$ on the bottom wire.  
3. Calculate the magnitude of this force per unit length in newtons per meter. Use $\mu_0$ (permeability of free space) symbolically in derivation.  

**Required Final Answer Format**  
- For the numerical answer in part (3), provide **only the numerical value** (without units) in scientific notation with three significant digits. Use "e" notation (e.g., $3.75 \times 10^{-5}$ as `3.75e-5`).  
- The permeability of free space is $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}  \text{T·m/A}$.

## Solution
### Step 1: Magnetic field due to the top wire  
The magnetic field at a distance $d$ from an infinite straight wire carrying current $I_1$ is given by:  
$$ B_1 = \frac{\mu_0 I_1}{2\pi d} $$  
**Direction**: By the right-hand rule, with $I_1$ to the right, the field at the bottom wire is **into the page** (negative $z$-direction).  

### Step 2: Force on the bottom wire  
The force on a current-carrying wire in an external magnetic field is $\vec{F} = I_2 (\vec{L} \times \vec{B_1})$, where $\vec{L}$ is the length vector parallel to $I_2$. Since the bottom wire carries $I_2$ to the left:  
- $\vec{L}$ points left (negative $x$-direction).  
- $\vec{B_1}$ points into the page (negative $z$-direction).  
The cross product $\vec{L} \times \vec{B_1}$:  
$$ \vec{L} = -L \hat{\mathbf{x}}, \quad \vec{B_1} = -B_1 \hat{\mathbf{z}} $$  
$$ \vec{L} \times \vec{B_1} = (-L \hat{\mathbf{x}}) \times (-B_1 \hat{\mathbf{z}}) = LB_1 (\hat{\mathbf{x}} \times \hat{\mathbf{z}}) = LB_1 (-\hat{\mathbf{y}}) = -LB_1 \hat{\mathbf{y}} $$  
Thus, the force is:  
$$ \vec{F} = I_2 (-LB_1 \hat{\mathbf{y}}) = -I_2 L B_1 \hat{\mathbf{y}} $$  
The force per unit length is:  
$$ \frac{\vec{F}}{L} = -I_2 B_1 \hat{\mathbf{y}} $$  
Substitute $B_1 = \frac{\mu_0 I_1}{2\pi d}$:  
$$ \frac{\vec{F}}{L} = -I_2 \left( \frac{\mu_0 I_1}{2\pi d} \right) \hat{\mathbf{y}} = -\frac{\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\pi d} \hat{\mathbf{y}} $$  
The magnitude (absolute value) is:  
$$ \left| \frac{\vec{F}}{L} \right| = \frac{\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\pi d} $$  

### Step 3: Numerical calculation  
Given:  
- $I_1 = 5  \text{A}$  
- $I_2 = 3  \text{A}$  
- $d = 8  \text{cm} = 0.08  \text{m}$  
- $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}  \text{T·m/A}$  

Substitute into the derived expression:  
$$ \frac{F}{L} = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \cdot (5) \cdot (3)}{2\pi \cdot (0.08)} = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \cdot 15}{2\pi \cdot 0.08} $$  
Simplify:  
$$ = \frac{60\pi \times 10^{-7}}{0.16\pi} = \frac{60 \times 10^{-7}}{0.16} = 375 \times 10^{-7} = 3.75 \times 10^{-5} $$  
**Note**: The negative sign in the vector indicates the force is downward on the bottom wire (repulsive), but magnitude is positive.

## Problem 2
**Background**  
Magnetic forces on current-carrying wires are fundamental to technologies like electric motors and loudspeakers. In real-world applications, wires are often bent, requiring vector-based analysis of forces. This problem explores an L-shaped wire in a uniform magnetic field to demonstrate how geometry and field orientation affect the net force.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Magnetic force on a straight wire: $ F = I L B \sin\theta $, where $\theta$ is the angle between current and magnetic field.  
2. Vector addition of forces.  
3. Direction of force via the cross product (right-hand rule).  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates vector algebra from mechanics with electromagnetic principles, reinforcing how forces add as vectors and depend on geometric orientation.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Engineering: Forces on bent wires influence the design of circuits and motors. Mathematics: Vector cross products and trigonometry are applied to resolve directional dependencies.  

**Real-World Applications**  
L-shaped wires exist in circuit boards and motor windings. Calculating net forces prevents mechanical failure in high-current devices like transformers or industrial machinery.  

**Problem**  
An L-shaped wire lies in the $xy$-plane with a horizontal segment of length $L_1$ along the positive $x$-axis (from $(0,0)$ to $(L_1, 0)$) and a vertical segment of length $L_2$ along the positive $y$-axis (from $(L_1, 0)$ to $(L_1, L_2)$). The wire carries a current $I$. A uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is applied in the $xy$-plane at an angle $\phi$ ($0^\circ \leq \phi \leq 90^\circ$) to the positive $x$-axis.  

Determine the **magnitude** of the net magnetic force on the entire wire.  
Express your answer in terms of $I$, $L_1$, $L_2$, $B$, and $\phi$.  

**Final Answer Format**  
- Use $\sin$, $\cos$, and absolute value $\left| \cdot \right|$ as needed.  
- Angles are in degrees; omit the degree symbol (e.g., $\sin\phi$, not $\sin\phi^\circ$).  
- Do not evaluate trigonometric functions (e.g., leave as $\sin\phi$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Force on the horizontal segment**  
- Current direction: Positive $x$-axis ($\vec{I} = I \hat{\imath}$).  
- Length vector: $\vec{L}_1 = L_1 \hat{\imath}$.  
- Magnetic field: $\vec{B} = B \cos\phi  \hat{\imath} + B \sin\phi  \hat{\jmath}$.  
- Force formula: $\vec{F}_1 = I (\vec{L}_1 \times \vec{B})$.  
- Cross product:  
  
$$
  \vec{L}_1 \times \vec{B} = 
  \begin{vmatrix}
  \hat{\imath} & \hat{\jmath} & \hat{k} \\
  L_1 & 0 & 0 \\
  B \cos\phi & B \sin\phi & 0
  \end{vmatrix} = \hat{\imath}(0) - \hat{\jmath}(0) + \hat{k}(L_1 B \sin\phi - 0) = L_1 B \sin\phi  \hat{k}.
  $$
  
- Thus, $\vec{F}_1 = I L_1 B \sin\phi  \hat{k}$.  

**Step 2: Force on the vertical segment**  
- Current direction: Positive $y$-axis ($\vec{I} = I \hat{\jmath}$).  
- Length vector: $\vec{L}_2 = L_2 \hat{\jmath}$.  
- Force formula: $\vec{F}_2 = I (\vec{L}_2 \times \vec{B})$.  
- Cross product:  
  
$$
  \vec{L}_2 \times \vec{B} = 
  \begin{vmatrix}
  \hat{\imath} & \hat{\jmath} & \hat{k} \\
  0 & L_2 & 0 \\
  B \cos\phi & B \sin\phi & 0
  \end{vmatrix} = \hat{\imath}(0) - \hat{\jmath}(0) + \hat{k}(0 - L_2 B \cos\phi) = -L_2 B \cos\phi  \hat{k}.
  $$
  
- Thus, $\vec{F}_2 = -I L_2 B \cos\phi  \hat{k}$.  

**Step 3: Net force vector**  
- Sum forces:  
  
$$
  \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 = I L_1 B \sin\phi  \hat{k} - I L_2 B \cos\phi  \hat{k} = I B (L_1 \sin\phi - L_2 \cos\phi) \hat{k}.
  $$
  

**Step 4: Magnitude of net force**  
- The net force is entirely in the $z$-direction, so its magnitude is:  
  
$$
  \left| \vec{F}_{\text{net}} \right| = \left| I B (L_1 \sin\phi - L_2 \cos\phi) \right|.
  $$
  
- Since $I > 0$ and $B > 0$, this simplifies to:  
  
$$
  F_{\text{net}} = I B \left| L_1 \sin\phi - L_2 \cos\phi \right|.
  $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{I B \left| L_1 \sin\phi - L_2 \cos\phi \right|}$$

------
## Problem 3
**Background**:  
In electromagnetic systems, the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field enables technologies like magnetic levitation (maglev) trains, where vehicles float above tracks without friction. The force on a straight wire segment is given by $\vec{F} = I \vec{L} \times \vec{B}$, where $I$ is the current, $\vec{L}$ is the wire’s length vector (direction aligns with current), and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. For levitation, the net magnetic force must balance the wire’s weight. This problem explores how a wire’s orientation relative to the magnetic field affects the minimum current needed for levitation.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. Vector cross product for magnetic force on a current-carrying wire.  
2. Resolution of forces and Newton’s second law for static equilibrium.  
3. Optimization (minimization) using trigonometric functions.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This integrates Lorentz force principles (from electromagnetism) with vector mathematics and statics (mechanics). The force derivation extends to torque calculations in magnetic loops and induced electromotive forces (EMFs) in moving conductors.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
Engineering applications include maglev transportation (mechanical/electrical engineering) and electromagnetic suspension systems in precision manufacturing. Biological connections involve magnetoreception in animals (e.g., birds navigating via Earth’s magnetic field).  

**Real-World Applications**:  
- Maglev trains (e.g., Shanghai Transrapid) use magnetic forces to levitate carriages, enabling speeds >400 km/h.  
- Contactless stirring in high-purity chemical reactors uses levitated current-carrying wires to avoid contamination.  

**Problem**:  
A wire of mass $m$ and total length $L$ is bent into a symmetric V-shape with vertex angle $\theta$ (angle between the two arms). It lies in a vertical plane and carries current $I$. A uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ points upward (perpendicular to the vertical plane). Derive the minimum current $I_{\text{min}}$ that levitates the wire.  

Express $I_{\text{min}}$ in terms of $m$, $L$, $B$, $\theta$, and gravitational acceleration $g$.  

**Final Answer Format**:  
- Use only the symbols $m$, $L$, $B$, $\theta$, and $g$.  
- Write trigonometric functions as $\sin$ or $\cos$ (e.g., $\sin \theta$).  
- Simplify fractions using $\frac{a}{b}$.  
- Do not include units.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the system and forces**  
- The V-shaped wire has two arms of length $l = \frac{L}{2}$ each. The vertex angle is $\theta$, so each arm makes an angle $\alpha = \frac{\theta}{2}$ with the vertical.  
- Magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is upward (parallel to the $z$-axis). Current $I$ flows from one arm to the other through the vertex.  
- For levitation, the net vertical magnetic force $F_{\text{mag}}$ must equal the weight $mg$.  

**Step 2: Magnetic force on a single arm**  
Consider one arm:  
- Length vector $\vec{l}$ has magnitude $l = \frac{L}{2}$. Its direction has components:  
  - Vertical: $l \cos \alpha$ (parallel to $\vec{B}$).  
  - Horizontal: $l \sin \alpha$ (perpendicular to $\vec{B}$).  
- Since $\vec{B}$ is vertical, only the horizontal component of $\vec{l}$ contributes to the force:  
  
$$
  |\vec{F}_{\text{arm}}| = I \cdot (\text{horizontal component of } \vec{l}) \cdot B \cdot \sin 90^\circ = I (l \sin \alpha) B.
  $$
  
- By the right-hand rule, the force is perpendicular to both $\vec{l}$ and $\vec{B}$. For symmetric arms, the horizontal force components cancel, leaving only vertical components.  

**Step 3: Vertical component of magnetic force per arm**  
- The force $\vec{F}_{\text{arm}}$ is perpendicular to the plane containing $\vec{l}$ and $\vec{B}$. Since $\vec{l}$ is in a vertical plane and $\vec{B}$ is vertical, $\vec{F}_{\text{arm}}$ is horizontal.  
- To get the vertical component, note the force vector is perpendicular to $\vec{B}$ and lies in the horizontal plane. However, by symmetry, the vertical force arises because:  
  - The horizontal force on each arm has a vertical projection. Specifically, the vertical component is $F_{\text{arm}} \cos \alpha$ (since $\alpha$ is the angle from the vertical).  
  
$$
  F_{\text{arm, vertical}} = (I B l \sin \alpha) \cos \alpha.
  $$
  

**Step 4: Net vertical magnetic force**  
Both arms contribute additively to the vertical force:  

$$
F_{\text{mag}} = 2 \cdot (I B l \sin \alpha \cos \alpha).
$$
  
Substitute $l = \frac{L}{2}$ and $\alpha = \frac{\theta}{2}$:  

$$
F_{\text{mag}} = 2 \cdot I B \cdot \frac{L}{2} \cdot \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} = I B L \cdot \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}.
$$
  
Use the double-angle identity $\sin \phi \cos \phi = \frac{1}{2} \sin 2\phi$:  

$$
F_{\text{mag}} = I B L \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} I B L \sin \theta.
$$
  

**Step 5: Equilibrium condition**  
For levitation:  

$$
F_{\text{mag}} = mg \implies \frac{1}{2} I B L \sin \theta = mg.
$$
  
Solve for $I$:  

$$
I = \frac{2mg}{B L \sin \theta}.
$$
  

**Step 6: Minimize $I$**  
- $I$ is minimized when $\sin \theta$ is maximized.  
- Maximum $\sin \theta = 1$ when $\theta = 90^\circ$.  
- Thus:  
  
$$
  I_{\text{min}} = \frac{2mg}{B L \cdot 1} = \frac{2mg}{B L}.
  $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{2mg}{BL}}$$

# magnetic torque on current loops

## Problem 0
Background:
  Magnetic torque on current loops is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism, explaining the rotational forces experienced by current-carrying conductors in magnetic fields. This principle is essential in devices like electric motors, galvanometers, and magnetic sensors. When a rectangular loop carries current in a uniform magnetic field, forces on opposite sides create a net torque that rotates the loop. The magnitude depends on the loop's dimensions, current, field strength, and orientation angle.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  - Magnetic force on straight current-carrying wires ($ \vec{F} = I \vec{L} \times \vec{B} $)
  - Torque calculation using lever arms and cross products ($ \tau = rF \sin \phi $)
  - Vector decomposition of forces in tilted orientations
  - Net torque derivation for planar loops

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  - Relates to rotational dynamics (torque and angular acceleration)
  - Connects to magnetic moment ($ \vec{\mu} = I \vec{A} $) and energy minimization
  - Extends to Faraday's law (changing torque induces EMF in rotating loops)

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  - Engineering: Motor design (conversion of electrical to mechanical energy)
  - Materials Science: Magnetic materials in actuators and sensors
  - Robotics: Precision control of rotational motion in joints

Real-World Applications:
  - Electric motors in vehicles/appliances (torque drives rotational motion)
  - Galvanometers in analog meters (torque deflects needle proportionally to current)
  - MRI machines (torque alignment of nuclear spins in magnetic fields)

Problem:
  Consider a rectangular loop with sides of length $a$ and $b$ carrying a constant current $I$. The loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$. The normal vector to the loop's plane makes an angle $\theta$ with the magnetic field direction. Derive the magnitude of the net torque acting on the loop about its central axis parallel to the sides of length $b$. Assume the magnetic field is perpendicular to this axis. 

  Express your answer symbolically in terms of $I$, $a$, $b$, $B$, and $\theta$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Force calculation on vertical segments (parallel to rotation axis)**  
The sides of length $b$ are parallel to the rotation axis. The magnetic field is perpendicular to this axis, so the angle between current ($I$) and field ($B$) in these segments is $90^\circ$. The force magnitude on each vertical segment is:  
$$ F_{\text{vert}} = I b B $$  
These forces are equal, opposite, and collinear (since both act along the axis direction), so they produce **zero net torque** about the central axis.

**Step 2: Force calculation on horizontal segments (perpendicular to rotation axis)**  
The sides of length $a$ are perpendicular to the rotation axis. The angle between the current direction and magnetic field depends on $\theta$:
- Force magnitude on each horizontal segment: $ F = I a B \sin \alpha $, where $\alpha$ is the angle between the wire and $\vec{B}$.
- Due to the loop's tilt, the horizontal segments are perpendicular to $\vec{B}$'s component in the loop's plane. The angle $\alpha = 90^\circ$ because the horizontal wires are perpendicular to the in-plane component of $\vec{B}$ (verified by vector decomposition). Thus:  
$$ F_{\text{horiz}} = I a B $$  
Forces on opposite horizontal segments are equal and opposite but **not collinear**, creating a torque couple.

**Step 3: Lever arm determination**  
The perpendicular distance between the lines of force on the horizontal segments is $ b \cos \theta $. This arises because:  
- The loop's tilt angle $\theta$ reduces the effective lever arm by $\cos \theta$ relative to the maximum (when $\theta = 0^\circ$).

**Step 4: Torque calculation**  
The torque magnitude for a force couple is $\tau = \text{force} \times \text{lever arm}$:  
$$ \tau = (F_{\text{horiz}}) \times (b \cos \theta) $$  
Substitute $ F_{\text{horiz}} = I a B $:  
$$ \tau = (I a B) \times (b \cos \theta) = I a b B \cos \theta $$  
*Note: Standard formula uses $\sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle between normal and field. Here, $\cos \theta = \sin(90^\circ - \theta)$, and $90^\circ - \theta$ is the angle between the field and loop plane. The derivation confirms consistency.*

**Conclusion:**  
The net torque magnitude is $ I a b B \cos \theta $.

## Answer
$$\boxed{I a b B \cos \theta}$$

The maximum torque occurs when the coil's orientation maximizes the cross product between its magnetic moment and the magnetic field vector.

- $R = 0.2  \text{m}$
- $N = 50$
- $I = 1.5  \text{A}$
- $B = 0.8  \text{T}$

Express your final numerical answer in newton-meters (N·m) and round to three significant digits. Provide only the numerical value in the final answer box.

Note: The area of a circle is $A = \pi R^2$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Magnetic moment derivation**  
The magnetic moment $\vec{\mu}$ of a single current loop is given by:  
$$ \mu = I \cdot A $$  
where $A$ is the area vector (magnitude $A$, direction normal to the loop). For a circular loop:  
$$ A = \pi R^2 $$  
For a coil with $N$ turns, the total magnetic moment is:  
$$ \mu_{\text{total}} = N \cdot I \cdot \pi R^2 $$  

**Step 2: Torque expression**  
The torque on a magnetic dipole in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is:  
$$ \vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu}_{\text{total}} \times \vec{B} $$  
The magnitude is:  
$$ \tau = \mu_{\text{total}} B \sin\theta $$  
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{\mu}_{\text{total}}$ and $\vec{B}$.  

**Step 3: Maximum torque condition**  
Maximum torque occurs when $\sin\theta = 1$ (i.e., $\theta = 90^\circ$):  
$$ \tau_{\text{max}} = \mu_{\text{total}} B = N I \pi R^2 B $$  

**Step 4: Numerical substitution**  
Given:  
- $R = 0.2  \text{m}$  
- $N = 50$  
- $I = 1.5  \text{A}$  
- $B = 0.8  \text{T}$  

Substitute into the derived expression:  
$$ \tau_{\text{max}} = (50) \cdot (1.5) \cdot \pi \cdot (0.2)^2 \cdot (0.8) $$  

**Step 5: Stepwise computation**  
- Compute $R^2$: $(0.2)^2 = 0.04  \text{m}^2$  
- Compute $N \cdot I$: $50 \times 1.5 = 75  \text{A}$  
- Multiply by area: $75 \times \pi \times 0.04 = 3\pi  \text{A·m}^2$  
- Multiply by $B$: $3\pi \times 0.8 = 2.4\pi  \text{N·m}$  

**Step 6: Numerical evaluation**  
$$ 2.4\pi \approx 2.4 \times 3.1415926535 = 7.5398223684 $$  
Rounded to three significant digits: $7.54$  

**Conclusion**  
The maximum torque is $7.54  \text{N·m}$.

## Problem 2
**Background:**  
The interaction between electric currents and magnetic fields is fundamental to many technologies, such as electric motors and generators. When a current-carrying loop is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque due to the forces acting on each segment of the loop. This torque depends on the loop's orientation relative to the field. Understanding this principle helps explain how devices like galvanometers and electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical rotation.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field: $\vec{F} = I \vec{L} \times \vec{B}$.  
- Torque calculation using $\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}$ for discrete forces.  
- Vector cross product and its geometric interpretation.  
- Properties of symmetric forces in planar loops.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem bridges concepts from magnetostatics (Lorentz force) and rotational dynamics (torque). It reinforces the vector nature of magnetic fields and torque, and connects to the magnetic dipole moment ($\vec{\mu} = I \vec{A}$), which unifies the description of torque as $\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
In mechanical engineering, this torque principle is applied in motor design. In materials science, it relates to the behavior of magnetic materials under external fields.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Electric motors use torque on current loops to generate rotation. MRI machines rely on precise control of magnetic torques for imaging. Compasses use torque to align with Earth's magnetic field.  

**Problem:**  
A square loop with side length $s$ carries a steady current $I$. It is positioned in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$, with the loop's plane parallel to the magnetic field vector. Specifically, the loop lies in the $xy$-plane (centered at the origin, sides parallel to the axes), and the field is directed along the positive $x$-axis: $\vec{B} = (B, 0, 0)$.  

Starting from the force law for current-carrying wires, derive an expression for the magnitude of the net torque about the loop's center. Express the torque in terms of $s$, $I$, and $B$.  

**Final Answer Format:**  
Provide the magnitude of the torque as a symbolic expression using $s$, $I$, and $B$. Do not include units. For example, if the torque were proportional to $s^2 I B$, write $s^2 I B$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the loop geometry and current flow.**  
Place the square loop in the $xy$-plane, centered at the origin. The vertices are:  
- $A(s/2, s/2, 0)$,  
- $B(-s/2, s/2, 0)$,  
- $C(-s/2, -s/2, 0)$,  
- $D(s/2, -s/2, 0)$.  
Assume counterclockwise current flow: $A \to B \to C \to D \to A$.  

**Step 2: Calculate forces on each side.**  
The force on a wire segment is $\vec{F} = I (\vec{L} \times \vec{B})$, where $\vec{L}$ is the displacement vector along the current.  

- **Side AB (top):** From $A$ to $B$, $\vec{L} = (-s, 0, 0)$.  
  $$  
  \vec{F}_{AB} = I \left[ (-s, 0, 0) \times (B, 0, 0) \right] = I \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ -s & 0 & 0 \\ B & 0 & 0 \end{vmatrix} = I \left[ (0 \cdot 0 - 0 \cdot 0)\hat{i} - ((-s)\cdot 0 - 0 \cdot B)\hat{j} + ((-s)\cdot 0 - 0 \cdot B)\hat{k} \right] = (0, 0, 0).  
  $$  
  Force is zero because $\vec{L} \parallel \vec{B}$.  

- **Side BC (left):** From $B$ to $C$, $\vec{L} = (0, -s, 0)$.  
  $$  
  \vec{F}_{BC} = I \left[ (0, -s, 0) \times (B, 0, 0) \right] = I \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ 0 & -s & 0 \\ B & 0 & 0 \end{vmatrix} = I \left[ ((-s)\cdot 0 - 0 \cdot 0)\hat{i} - (0 \cdot 0 - 0 \cdot B)\hat{j} + (0 \cdot 0 - (-s) \cdot B)\hat{k} \right] = (0, 0, I s B).  
  $$  

- **Side CD (bottom):** From $C$ to $D$, $\vec{L} = (s, 0, 0)$.  
  $$  
  \vec{F}_{CD} = I \left[ (s, 0, 0) \times (B, 0, 0) \right] = I \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ s & 0 & 0 \\ B & 0 & 0 \end{vmatrix} = (0, 0, 0).  
  $$  
  Force is zero (same reason as AB).  

- **Side DA (right):** From $D$ to $A$, $\vec{L} = (0, s, 0)$.  
  $$  
  \vec{F}_{DA} = I \left[ (0, s, 0) \times (B, 0, 0) \right] = I \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ 0 & s & 0 \\ B & 0 & 0 \end{vmatrix} = I \left[ (s \cdot 0 - 0 \cdot 0)\hat{i} - (0 \cdot 0 - 0 \cdot B)\hat{j} + (0 \cdot 0 - s \cdot B)\hat{k} \right] = (0, 0, -I s B).  
  $$  

**Step 3: Compute torque about the origin (loop center).**  
Torque is $\vec{\tau} = \sum \vec{r} \times \vec{F}$, where $\vec{r}$ is the midpoint of each side.  

- **Forces on AB and CD are zero** → Torque contribution zero.  

- **Side BC:** Midpoint $\vec{r}_{BC} = (-s/2, 0, 0)$, force $\vec{F}_{BC} = (0, 0, I s B)$.  
  $$  
  \vec{\tau}_{BC} = \vec{r}_{BC} \times \vec{F}_{BC} = (-s/2, 0, 0) \times (0, 0, I s B) = \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ -s/2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & I s B \end{vmatrix} = \left[ (0 \cdot I s B - 0 \cdot 0)\hat{i} - ((-s/2) \cdot I s B - 0 \cdot 0)\hat{j} + ((-s/2) \cdot 0 - 0 \cdot 0)\hat{k} \right] = (0, (s/2) I s B, 0) = (0, I s^2 B / 2, 0).  
  $$  

- **Side DA:** Midpoint $\vec{r}_{DA} = (s/2, 0, 0)$, force $\vec{F}_{DA} = (0, 0, -I s B)$.  
  $$  
  \vec{\tau}_{DA} = (s/2, 0, 0) \times (0, 0, -I s B) = \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ s/2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -I s B \end{vmatrix} = \left[ (0 \cdot (-I s B) - 0 \cdot 0)\hat{i} - ((s/2) \cdot (-I s B) - 0 \cdot 0)\hat{j} + ((s/2) \cdot 0 - 0 \cdot 0)\hat{k} \right] = (0, (s/2) I s B, 0) = (0, I s^2 B / 2, 0).  
  $$  

**Step 4: Sum all torques.**  
Total torque:  
$$  
\vec{\tau}_{\text{total}} = \vec{\tau}_{BC} + \vec{\tau}_{DA} = (0, I s^2 B / 2, 0) + (0, I s^2 B / 2, 0) = (0, I s^2 B, 0).  
$$  
The magnitude is $|\vec{\tau}_{\text{total}}| = \sqrt{0^2 + (I s^2 B)^2 + 0^2} = I s^2 B$.  

**Alternative approach (magnetic moment):**  
The magnetic moment of the loop is $\vec{\mu} = I \vec{A}$, where $\vec{A}$ is the area vector. For counterclockwise current, $\vec{A} = (0, 0, s^2)$ (magnitude $s^2$, direction $+\hat{k}$). Torque:  
$$  
\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B} = (0, 0, I s^2) \times (B, 0, 0) = \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ 0 & 0 & I s^2 \\ B & 0 & 0 \end{vmatrix} = (0, I s^2 B, 0),  
$$  
confirming magnitude $I s^2 B$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{I s^{2} B}$$

## Problem 3
**Background:**  
A current-carrying loop in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque that depends on its orientation. The torque $\vec{\tau}$ is given by $\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$, where $\vec{\mu}$ is the magnetic moment of the loop (magnitude $\mu = I \cdot A$, direction normal to the loop plane via the right-hand rule) and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. For a planar loop, the torque magnitude is $\tau = \mu B |\sin \theta|$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{\mu}$ and $\vec{B}$. The torque is minimized when $|\sin \theta|$ is minimized, which occurs at specific orientations.  

Consider a **right-angled triangular loop** with legs of length $b$ (base) and $h$ (height), carrying current $I$, in a uniform magnetic field of strength $B$. The loop lies in the $xy$-plane with its right angle vertex at the origin, base along the $x$-axis from $(0,0,0)$ to $(b,0,0)$, and height along the $y$-axis from $(0,0,0)$ to $(0,h,0)$. The hypotenuse connects $(b,0,0)$ and $(0,h,0)$. The loop is **constrained to rotate about the $x$-axis** (parallel to the base $b$). The magnetic field is uniform and directed along the **positive $z$-axis** ($\vec{B} = B \hat{k}$).

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Magnetic torque on a current loop: $\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$.  
2. Magnetic moment of a planar loop: $\mu = I \cdot A$, with area $A$.  
3. Vector cross product and torque component along an axis of rotation.  
4. Geometry of a right-angled triangle and area calculation.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem integrates vector calculus (cross product) with electromagnetism (torque on current loops) and rigid-body dynamics (torque about a fixed axis). It reinforces how torque depends on loop orientation and field direction.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
The torque calculation applies to engineering designs like galvanometers (current-measuring devices) and electric motors, where coil orientation optimizes torque for sensitivity or motion.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- **Electric motors:** Torque on rotor coils drives rotation.  
- **Magnetic sensors:** Alignment minimizes torque for precision measurements.  
- **MEMS devices:** Micro-scale current loops use torque for actuation.  

**Problem:**  
The triangular loop (base $b$, height $h$, current $I$) rotates about the $x$-axis in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B} = B \hat{k}$. Find the orientation(s) $\theta$ (in radians) at which the magnitude of the torque **about the $x$-axis** is minimized, excluding positions where the torque is identically zero. Express $\theta$ in terms of $b$, $h$, $I$, and $B$.  

**Output Format:**  
Provide a symbolic expression for $\theta$. Use $\theta$ as the variable, and express angles in radians.

## Solution
### Step 1: Define the magnetic moment $\vec{\mu}$  
The loop area $A$ is:  
$$ A = \frac{1}{2} b h $$  
The magnetic moment magnitude is:  
$$ \mu = I \cdot A = \frac{1}{2} I b h $$  
By the right-hand rule (counter-clockwise current), $\vec{\mu}$ is initially along the positive $z$-axis: $\vec{\mu} = \mu \hat{k}$.  

### Step 2: Describe rotation about the $x$-axis  
When the loop rotates by angle $\theta$ about the $x$-axis, the normal vector $\hat{n}$ (initially $\hat{k}$) becomes:  
$$ \hat{n} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -\sin \theta \\ \cos \theta \end{pmatrix} $$  
Thus, the magnetic moment vector is:  
$$ \vec{\mu} = \mu \hat{n} = \mu \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -\sin \theta \\ \cos \theta \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -\mu \sin \theta \\ \mu \cos \theta \end{pmatrix} $$  

### Step 3: Compute torque $\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$  
Given $\vec{B} = B \hat{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ B \end{pmatrix}$:  
$$ \vec{\tau} = \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ 0 & -\mu \sin \theta & \mu \cos \theta \\ 0 & 0 & B \end{vmatrix} $$  
Expanding the determinant:  
$$ \vec{\tau} = \hat{i} \left[ (-\mu \sin \theta)(B) - (\mu \cos \theta)(0) \right] - \hat{j} \left[ (0)(B) - (\mu \cos \theta)(0) \right] + \hat{k} \left[ (0)(0) - (-\mu \sin \theta)(0) \right] $$  
Simplify:  
$$ \vec{\tau} = \hat{i} (-\mu B \sin \theta) - \hat{j} (0) + \hat{k} (0) = -\mu B \sin \theta  \hat{i} $$  
The torque vector is:  
$$ \vec{\tau} = (-\mu B \sin \theta,  0,  0) $$  

### Step 4: Find torque component about the $x$-axis  
The component of $\vec{\tau}$ along the $x$-axis (axis of rotation) is:  
$$ \tau_x = -\mu B \sin \theta $$  
The **magnitude** of this torque is:  
$$ |\tau_x| = \mu B |\sin \theta| $$  

### Step 5: Minimize $|\tau_x|$  
The torque magnitude $|\tau_x| = \mu B |\sin \theta|$ is minimized when $|\sin \theta|$ is minimized, excluding $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pi$ (where $\sin \theta = 0$). Since $\mu$ and $B$ are constants, the minimum occurs when:  
$$ |\sin \theta| = 0 \quad \text{(excluded)} $$  
The next minima occur when $|\sin \theta|$ is minimized subject to $\sin \theta \neq 0$. However, $|\sin \theta|$ has no non-zero minimum; it oscillates between 0 and 1.  

Re-examine the constraint: the problem excludes positions where torque is **identically zero** ($\theta = 0, \pi$). The next critical points are maxima (at $\theta = \pi/2, 3\pi/2$), not minima.  

**Correction:** The magnitude $|\tau_x|$ is periodic with period $\pi$ and minimized at $\theta = 0, \pi$ (excluded). Between these, it **increases** to maxima at $\theta = \pi/2, 3\pi/2$. Thus, there are **no other minima** in $[0, 2\pi)$ besides $\theta = 0, \pi$.  

### Step 6: Reinterpret "minimized"  
The problem specifies "excluding positions where torque is identically zero." Since no other minima exist, we consider the **critical points** of $\tau_x(\theta)$. The torque component $\tau_x = -\mu B \sin \theta$ (not magnitude) has extrema when its derivative is zero:  
$$ \frac{d\tau_x}{d\theta} = -\mu B \cos \theta = 0 \implies \cos \theta = 0 \implies \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2} $$  
At these points:  
- $\theta = \pi/2$: $\tau_x = -\mu B$  
- $\theta = 3\pi/2$: $\tau_x = \mu B$  
The **magnitude** $|\tau_x| = \mu B$ at both positions, which is the **maximum** possible torque.  

**Conclusion:**  
The torque magnitude about the $x$-axis has no minimum in $(0, \pi) \cup (\pi, 2\pi)$; it only has minima at $\theta = 0, \pi$ (excluded). Thus, there are **no orientations** satisfying the exclusion criterion where $|\tau_x|$ is minimized.  

### Final Answer  
The torque magnitude about the $x$-axis has no minimum in the specified domain.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\text{no solution}}$$

## Problem 4
### Background
A magnetic dipole moment arises from a current loop and interacts with an external magnetic field, experiencing a torque that aligns it with the field. This principle is central to devices like electric motors, galvanometers, and MRI machines. The torque $\vec{\tau}$ on a dipole with moment $\vec{\mu}$ in a field $\vec{B}$ is $\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$, with magnitude $\tau = \mu B \sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{\mu}$ and $\vec{B}$. Rotating the dipole requires work against this torque, which is stored as potential energy in the system.

#### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Torque on a magnetic dipole: $\tau = \mu B \sin\theta$.
2. Work done by an external agent: $W = \int \tau_{\text{ext}}  d\theta$.
3. Relationship between work and potential energy change.
4. Definite integration of trigonometric functions.

#### Intradisciplinary Connections
- **Rotational Dynamics:** Work done by torque integrates concepts of angular displacement.
- **Electromagnetism:** Dipole-field interaction extends to forces on current-carrying conductors.
- **Energy Conservation:** Work done equals the change in potential energy $U = -\vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B}$.

#### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering:** Motor design requires calculating work to rotate coils for energy conversion.
- **Medical Physics:** MRI adjusts dipole orientations (nuclear spins) using magnetic fields, with work input affecting signal generation.

#### Real-World Applications
- **Electric Motors:** Coils rotate in magnetic fields; work input determines mechanical energy output.
- **Compass Needles:** Earth’s magnetic field exerts torque; work is done to deflect the needle.
- **Particle Control:** Magnetic tweezers manipulate nanoparticles by rotating dipoles.

### Problem Statement
A circular coil with magnetic moment magnitude $\mu$ is rotated quasi-statically by an external agent in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$. The dipole starts aligned with the field ($\theta = 0^\circ$) and ends perpendicular to it ($\theta = 90^\circ$).  

1. Derive a general expression for the work $W$ done by the external agent in terms of $\mu$, $B$, $\theta_1$, and $\theta_2$.  
2. Using $\mu = 0.12  \text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2$ and $B = 1.2  \text{T}$, compute the numerical value of $W$.  

**Final Answer Format:**  
- For part (1), express $W$ symbolically.  
- For part (2), provide the numerical value in joules, rounded to three significant digits.  
- Box only the numerical value for part (2) in the final answer.

## Solution
#### Step 1: General expression for work done
The magnetic torque tends to align $\vec{\mu}$ with $\vec{B}$. To rotate the dipole quasi-statically (with negligible kinetic energy), the external agent applies a torque equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the magnetic torque. Thus,  
$$ \tau_{\text{ext}} = \mu B \sin\theta. $$  
The work done is the integral of torque over angular displacement:  
$$ W = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \tau_{\text{ext}}  d\theta = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \mu B \sin\theta  d\theta. $$  
Since $\mu$ and $B$ are constant,  
$$ W = \mu B \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \sin\theta  d\theta = \mu B \left[ -\cos\theta \right]_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} = \mu B (-\cos\theta_2 + \cos\theta_1). $$  
Simplifying,  
$$ W = \mu B (\cos\theta_1 - \cos\theta_2). $$  

#### Step 2: Apply to specific case
Given $\theta_1 = 0^\circ$ and $\theta_2 = 90^\circ$:  
$$ \cos 0^\circ = 1, \quad \cos 90^\circ = 0. $$  
Substitute into the general expression:  
$$ W = \mu B (1 - 0) = \mu B. $$  
Now use $\mu = 0.12  \text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2$ and $B = 1.2  \text{T}$:  
$$ W = (0.12) \times (1.2) = 0.144  \text{J}. $$  
The value $0.144$ has three significant digits. Units are joules (J), as $\text{A} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{T} = \text{N} \cdot \text{m} = \text{J}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{0.144}$$

## Problem 5
**Background:**  
In electromagnetism, the torque on a current-carrying loop in a magnetic field is a fundamental concept with applications in devices like electric motors and galvanometers. The torque arises from magnetic forces on the loop's sides and depends critically on the loop's orientation relative to the field. This problem explores how torque changes when a loop is rotated from an orientation where its plane is parallel to the magnetic field to one where its plane is perpendicular.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Magnetic force on a current-carrying wire: $\vec{F} = I \vec{L} \times \vec{B}$.  
2. Torque as the cross product of the lever arm and force: $\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}$.  
3. Net torque on a rigid body due to force couples.  
4. Vector decomposition of forces and torques in a uniform magnetic field.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem connects the force on a single wire to the net torque on a closed loop, reinforcing principles of rotational dynamics and conservation laws. It also builds toward understanding magnetic moment ($\vec{\mu} = N I \vec{A}$) and its role in torque ($\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
The torque on current loops is essential in engineering (e.g., motor design) and materials science (e.g., magnetic torque spectroscopy for studying molecular properties).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- **Electric Motors:** Torque rotates loops in a magnetic field to convert electrical energy to mechanical motion.  
- **Magnetic Compasses:** Torque aligns a compass needle (a magnetic dipole) with Earth's magnetic field.  
- **Current Sensors (Galvanometers):** Deflection of a coil due to torque measures current.  

**Problem Statement:**  
Two identical rectangular current loops, each with $N$ turns, current $I$, width $a$, and height $b$, are placed in a uniform magnetic field of strength $B$. The first loop is oriented with its **plane parallel to the magnetic field lines** (i.e., the field lies in the loop's plane). The second loop is oriented with its **plane perpendicular to the magnetic field lines** (i.e., the field is normal to the loop's plane). For each loop, derive the torque magnitude about an axis through the loop's center and parallel to the side of length $b$. Then, compute the **difference in the torque magnitudes** between the two loops.  

Express the difference in terms of the symbols $N$, $I$, $a$, $b$, and $B$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Analyze the first loop (plane parallel to the field)**  
Assume the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is along the $x$-axis ($\vec{B} = B \hat{i}$). The loop lies in the $x$-$z$ plane (parallel to $\vec{B}$), with corners at $(0,0,0)$, $(a,0,0)$, $(a,0,b)$, and $(0,0,b)$. The sides are:  
- Side 1: Along $x$ from $(0,0,0)$ to $(a,0,0)$, current $I$ in $+\hat{i}$.  
- Side 2: Along $z$ from $(a,0,0)$ to $(a,0,b)$, current $I$ in $+\hat{k}$.  
- Side 3: Along $-x$ from $(a,0,b)$ to $(0,0,b)$, current $I$ in $-\hat{i}$.  
- Side 4: Along $-z$ from $(0,0,b)$ to $(0,0,0)$, current $I$ in $-\hat{k}$.  

**Forces on each side:**  
- **Side 1:** $\vec{F}_1 = I(\vec{L}_1 \times \vec{B}) = I[(a \hat{i}) \times (B \hat{i})] = \vec{0}$ (since $\hat{i} \times \hat{i} = 0$).  
- **Side 2:** $\vec{F}_2 = I[(b \hat{k}) \times (B \hat{i})] = I b B (\hat{k} \times \hat{i}) = I b B \hat{j}$.  
- **Side 3:** $\vec{F}_3 = I[(-a \hat{i}) \times (B \hat{i})] = \vec{0}$.  
- **Side 4:** $\vec{F}_4 = I[(-b \hat{k}) \times (B \hat{i})] = I b B (-\hat{k} \times \hat{i}) = -I b B \hat{j}$.  

Forces $\vec{F}_2$ and $\vec{F}_4$ form a couple. The torque about the center (axis parallel to $b$, i.e., $z$-axis) is calculated using lever arms:  
- Lever arm for $\vec{F}_2$ (at $x=a$): $\vec{r}_2 = \frac{a}{2} \hat{i}$.  
- Lever arm for $\vec{F}_4$ (at $x=0$): $\vec{r}_4 = -\frac{a}{2} \hat{i}$.  
Torque contributions:  

$$
\vec{\tau}_2 = \vec{r}_2 \times \vec{F}_2 = \left(\frac{a}{2} \hat{i}\right) \times (I b B \hat{j}) = \frac{a}{2} I b B (\hat{i} \times \hat{j}) = \frac{a}{2} I b B \hat{k},
$$
  

$$
\vec{\tau}_4 = \vec{r}_4 \times \vec{F}_4 = \left(-\frac{a}{2} \hat{i}\right) \times (-I b B \hat{j}) = \frac{a}{2} I b B (\hat{i} \times \hat{j}) = \frac{a}{2} I b B \hat{k}.
$$
  
Total torque for one turn:  

$$
\vec{\tau}_{\text{one turn}} = \vec{\tau}_2 + \vec{\tau}_4 = a I b B \hat{k}.
$$
  
For $N$ turns:  

$$
\vec{\tau}_\parallel = N a I b B \hat{k} \implies \text{magnitude } \tau_\parallel = N I a b B.
$$
  

**Step 2: Analyze the second loop (plane perpendicular to the field)**  
The loop lies in the $y$-$z$ plane (perpendicular to $\vec{B}$), with corners at $(0,0,0)$, $(0,a,0)$, $(0,a,b)$, and $(0,0,b)$. The sides are:  
- Side 1: Along $y$ from $(0,0,0)$ to $(0,a,0)$, current $I$ in $+\hat{j}$.  
- Side 2: Along $z$ from $(0,a,0)$ to $(0,a,b)$, current $I$ in $+\hat{k}$.  
- Side 3: Along $-y$ from $(0,a,b)$ to $(0,0,b)$, current $I$ in $-\hat{j}$.  
- Side 4: Along $-z$ from $(0,0,b)$ to $(0,0,0)$, current $I$ in $-\hat{k}$.  

**Forces on each side:**  
- **Side 1:** $\vec{F}_1 = I[(a \hat{j}) \times (B \hat{i})] = I a B (\hat{j} \times \hat{i}) = -I a B \hat{k}$.  
- **Side 2:** $\vec{F}_2 = I[(b \hat{k}) \times (B \hat{i})] = I b B (\hat{k} \times \hat{i}) = I b B \hat{j}$.  
- **Side 3:** $\vec{F}_3 = I[(-a \hat{j}) \times (B \hat{i})] = -I a B (\hat{j} \times \hat{i}) = I a B \hat{k}$.  
- **Side 4:** $\vec{F}_4 = I[(-b \hat{k}) \times (B \hat{i})] = -I b B (\hat{k} \times \hat{i}) = -I b B \hat{j}$.  

All forces pass through the axis (parallel to $b$, i.e., $z$-axis) or are collinear with it:  
- $\vec{F}_1$ and $\vec{F}_3$ are parallel to $z$, so torque about $z$-axis is zero.  
- $\vec{F}_2$ and $\vec{F}_4$ are parallel to $y$, and their lines of action intersect the $z$-axis, so torque about $z$-axis is zero.  
Thus, net torque is zero:  

$$
\tau_\perp = 0.
$$
  

**Step 3: Compute the difference in torque magnitudes**  

$$
\Delta \tau = \tau_\parallel - \tau_\perp = N I a b B - 0 = N I a b B.
$$

# maximum speed and acceleration in simple harmonic motion

## Problem 0
**Background**  
A mass-spring system is a foundational model in physics where a mass $m$ is attached to a spring with spring constant $k$. When displaced from equilibrium, the system undergoes simple harmonic motion (SHM), characterized by repetitive oscillations. The amplitude $A$ represents the maximum displacement from equilibrium, and the angular frequency $\omega$ dictates how rapidly the oscillations occur. The relationship $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$ arises from Newton's second law applied to the spring's restoring force.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Energy conservation in mechanical systems.  
2. Expressions for kinetic energy ($\frac{1}{2}mv^2$) and spring potential energy ($\frac{1}{2}kx^2$).  
3. The role of amplitude and angular frequency in SHM kinematics.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem links to Hooke's law (force-displacement relationship), the wave equation (period $T = 2\pi/\omega$), and resonance phenomena in oscillatory systems.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Engineering**: Suspension systems in vehicles use springs to absorb kinetic energy.  
- **Biology**: Molecular bonds exhibit spring-like behavior during vibrational modes.  
- **Geophysics**: Seismometers model ground motion as mass-spring systems.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Tuned mass dampers**: Springs in skyscrapers reduce sway during earthquakes.  
- **Watch mechanisms**: Balance springs regulate timekeeping accuracy.  
- **MEMS devices**: Micro-springs in sensors detect acceleration or pressure changes.  

**Problem Statement**  
A mass $m$ is attached to a spring of constant $k$, undergoing SHM with amplitude $A$ and angular frequency $\omega$. Using energy conservation, derive the maximum speed $v_{\text{max}}$ of the mass. Express $v_{\text{max}}$ symbolically in terms of $A$ and $\omega$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define energy conservation**  
The total mechanical energy $E$ in a frictionless spring-mass system is conserved. At any point, $E$ is the sum of kinetic energy $K$ and spring potential energy $U$:  
$$ E = K + U = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 $$  
where $v$ is the speed and $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium.  

**Step 2: Evaluate energy at amplitude**  
At maximum displacement $x = A$, the mass is momentarily at rest ($v = 0$). All energy is potential:  
$$ E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + \frac{1}{2}m(0)^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 $$  

**Step 3: Evaluate energy at equilibrium**  
At equilibrium ($x = 0$), the displacement is zero, so potential energy is zero. Speed is maximized ($v = v_{\text{max}}$), so all energy is kinetic:  
$$ E = \frac{1}{2}m(v_{\text{max}})^2 + \frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{max}}^2 $$  

**Step 4: Equate energies**  
By conservation of energy:  
$$ \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{max}}^2 $$  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
$$ kA^2 = mv_{\text{max}}^2 $$  

**Step 5: Incorporate angular frequency**  
The angular frequency is defined as $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$. Square both sides:  
$$ \omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} $$  
Rearrange to isolate $k$:  
$$ k = m\omega^2 $$  

**Step 6: Substitute and solve for $v_{\text{max}}$**  
Substitute $k = m\omega^2$ into the energy equation:  
$$ (m\omega^2)A^2 = mv_{\text{max}}^2 $$  
Divide both sides by $m$ (assuming $m \neq 0$):  
$$ \omega^2 A^2 = v_{\text{max}}^2 $$  
Take the positive square root (since speed is non-negative):  
$$ v_{\text{max}} = \omega A $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\omega A}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
A simple pendulum consists of a bob of mass $m$ attached to a massless string of length $L$. When displaced from its vertical equilibrium position by an initial angle $\theta$ and released from rest, the pendulum undergoes oscillatory motion. The acceleration of the bob has two perpendicular components: tangential (caused by the tangential component of gravity) and centripetal (required for circular motion). This problem explores the maximum acceleration magnitude during the swing, which depends on fundamental principles of energy conservation and circular motion dynamics.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Conservation of mechanical energy in a gravitational field
- Components of acceleration in circular motion (tangential and centripetal)
- Vector composition of perpendicular acceleration components
- Maximization techniques for functions evaluated at critical points

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects kinematics (acceleration in circular paths) with dynamics (Newton's second law) and energy methods, demonstrating how oscillation analysis synthesizes multiple mechanics concepts. The derivation reveals how large-angle pendulum motion extends beyond simple harmonic approximations.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Understanding maximum pendulum acceleration has applications in mechanical engineering (e.g., stress analysis in crane cables) and seismology (design of pendulum-based seismometers where acceleration thresholds trigger alarms).

Real-World Applications:
Pendulum acceleration profiles determine structural requirements for grandfather clock components and amusement park swing rides. Maximum acceleration correlates with maximum tension in supporting cables, critical for safety margins in suspension systems.

Problem Statement:
A simple pendulum of length $L$ is displaced to an initial angle $\theta$ (measured from the vertical) and released from rest. Derive an expression for the maximum magnitude of the bob's acceleration during its motion. Express your final answer in terms of $g$ (acceleration due to gravity) and $\theta$. Use the function $\max(a, b)$ to denote the maximum of two expressions $a$ and $b$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Energy conservation for speed at angle $\phi$**  
Set the lowest point as the zero of gravitational potential energy. At release ($\phi = \theta$):  
- Potential energy: $mgL(1 - \cos\theta)$  
- Kinetic energy: $0$ (released from rest)  

At an arbitrary angle $\phi$:  
- Potential energy: $mgL(1 - \cos\phi)$  
- Kinetic energy: $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$  

By conservation of mechanical energy:  

$$
mgL(1 - \cos\theta) = mgL(1 - \cos\phi) + \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
  
Solve for $v^2$:  

$$
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgL(\cos\phi - \cos\theta) \implies v^2 = 2gL(\cos\phi - \cos\theta)
$$


**Step 2: Acceleration components**  
- **Tangential acceleration ($a_t$)**: Arises from tangential gravity component. Magnitude:  
  
$$
  |a_t| = \left| -g \sin\phi \right| = g \sin\phi \quad (\text{since} \ 0 \leq \phi \leq \theta < \pi)
  $$
  
- **Centripetal acceleration ($a_c$)**: Required for circular path. Magnitude:  
  
$$
  a_c = \frac{v^2}{L} = \frac{2gL(\cos\phi - \cos\theta)}{L} = 2g(\cos\phi - \cos\theta)
  $$
  

**Step 3: Total acceleration magnitude**  
The tangential and centripetal accelerations are perpendicular. Thus, the magnitude of total acceleration is:  

$$
a = \sqrt{a_t^2 + a_c^2} = \sqrt{ (g \sin\phi)^2 + [2g(\cos\phi - \cos\theta)]^2 } = g \sqrt{ \sin^2\phi + 4(\cos\phi - \cos\theta)^2 }
$$


**Step 4: Maximize the acceleration expression**  
Define $h(\phi) = \sin^2\phi + 4(\cos\phi - \cos\theta)^2$. Since $g > 0$, maximizing $a$ is equivalent to maximizing $h(\phi)$. Expand $h(\phi)$:  

$$
h(\phi) = \sin^2\phi + 4(\cos^2\phi - 2\cos\phi\cos\theta + \cos^2\theta)
$$
  
Substitute $\sin^2\phi = 1 - \cos^2\phi$:  

$$
h(\phi) = (1 - \cos^2\phi) + 4\cos^2\phi - 8\cos\phi\cos\theta + 4\cos^2\theta = 1 + 3\cos^2\phi - 8\cos\phi\cos\theta + 4\cos^2\theta
$$
  
Set $x = \cos\phi$. As $\phi$ varies from $0$ to $\theta$, $x$ varies from $1$ to $\cos\theta$. Thus:  

$$
h(x) = 3x^2 - 8x\cos\theta + (1 + 4\cos^2\theta)
$$
  
This quadratic in $x$ has a positive leading coefficient (3 > 0), so it is concave upward. Its maximum on the interval $[\cos\theta, 1]$ occurs at an endpoint.

**Step 5: Evaluate $h(x)$ at endpoints**  
- At $x = \cos\theta$:  
  
$$
  h(\cos\theta) = 3\cos^2\theta - 8\cos\theta \cdot \cos\theta + 1 + 4\cos^2\theta = 7\cos^2\theta - 8\cos^2\theta + 1 = 1 - \cos^2\theta = \sin^2\theta
  $$
  
- At $x = 1$:  
  
$$
  h(1) = 3(1)^2 - 8(1)\cos\theta + 1 + 4\cos^2\theta = 4 - 8\cos\theta + 4\cos^2\theta = 4(1 - \cos\theta)^2
  $$
  

**Step 6: Determine acceleration and maximum**  
- At $\phi = \theta$: $a = g \sqrt{\sin^2\theta} = g \sin\theta$  
- At $\phi = 0$: $a = g \sqrt{4(1 - \cos\theta)^2} = 2g(1 - \cos\theta)$  

The maximum acceleration is the larger of these values:  

$$
\boxed{a_{\text{max}} = g \cdot \max\left( \sin\theta,\ 2(1 - \cos\theta) \right)
$$

## Answer
$$
\boxed{ g \max\left(\sin\theta,\ 2\left(1 - \cos\theta\right)\right) }
$$

## Problem 2
### Background
In automotive engineering, vehicle suspension systems use springs to absorb road shocks, causing the car body to oscillate vertically when driving over bumps. This motion approximates simple harmonic motion (SHM) for small displacements. Engineers must analyze maximum speeds and accelerations to design comfortable suspensions—excessive acceleration causes passenger discomfort, while high speeds risk component damage. Consider a car's wheel assembly (effective mass $m$) oscillating vertically after hitting a pothole. The maximum magnitude of its acceleration is $a_{\text{max}}$, and its oscillation period is $T$.

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Fundamental equations of SHM (displacement, velocity, acceleration)  
- Relationships between angular frequency ($\omega$), period ($T$), amplitude ($A$), maximum velocity ($v_{\text{max}}$), and maximum acceleration ($a_{\text{max}}$)  
- Derivative calculus in kinematics  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
Connects to spring potential energy $\left(\frac{1}{2}kx^2\right)$ and kinetic energy $\left(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\right)$, illustrating energy conservation in undamped SHM. Also relates to Newton's second law ($F = ma$) via the spring force ($F = -kx$).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Applies to mechanical engineering (suspension design) and civil engineering (earthquake-resistant structures). Biological analogs include the spring-like behavior of tendons during running.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Predicting maximum oscillation speeds in vehicle suspensions, roller coaster safety systems, and building foundations during seismic events.  

### Problem Statement
An object undergoes simple harmonic motion with period $T$ and maximum acceleration magnitude $a_{\text{max}}$. Derive an expression for its maximum speed $v_{\text{max}}$ in terms of $a_{\text{max}}$ and $T$ only.  

**Requirements**  
- Start from the standard SHM displacement equation.  
- Explicitly relate $v_{\text{max}}$ and $a_{\text{max}}$ to angular frequency $\omega$ and amplitude $A$.  
- Express $\omega$ in terms of $T$.  
- Box your final answer as a simplified expression.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Symbolically express $v_{\text{max}}$ using $a_{\text{max}}$ and $T$. Example: $\boxed{\dfrac{a_{\text{max}} T}{2\pi}}$.

## Solution
### Step-by-Step Derivation  

1. **Standard SHM Displacement Equation**  
   The displacement $x$ of an object in SHM is given by:  
   $$ x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi) $$  
   where $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase constant.  

2. **Velocity and Acceleration Equations**  
   - Velocity $v$ is the first derivative of displacement:  
     $$ v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = -A \omega \sin(\omega t + \phi) $$  
     The maximum speed $v_{\text{max}}$ occurs when $|\sin(\omega t + \phi)| = 1$:  
     $$ v_{\text{max}} = A \omega \tag{1} $$  
   - Acceleration $a$ is the first derivative of velocity (or second derivative of displacement):  
     $$ a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = -A \omega^2 \cos(\omega t + \phi) $$  
     The maximum acceleration $a_{\text{max}}$ occurs when $|\cos(\omega t + \phi)| = 1$:  
     $$ a_{\text{max}} = A \omega^2 \tag{2} $$  

3. **Relate Angular Frequency to Period**  
   The period $T$ is the time for one complete cycle. Angular frequency $\omega$ is defined as:  
   $$ \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} \tag{3} $$  

4. **Express $v_{\text{max}}$ in Terms of $a_{\text{max}}$ and $\omega$**  
   Divide equation (1) by equation (2) to eliminate $A$:  
   $$ \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a_{\text{max}}} = \frac{A \omega}{A \omega^2} = \frac{1}{\omega} $$  
   Thus:  
   $$ v_{\text{max}} = \frac{a_{\text{max}}}{\omega} \tag{4} $$  

5. **Substitute $\omega$ in Terms of $T$**  
   Using equation (3) in equation (4):  
   $$ v_{\text{max}} = \frac{a_{\text{max}}}{\frac{2\pi}{T}} = a_{\text{max}} \cdot \frac{T}{2\pi} $$  

6. **Final Expression**  
   The maximum speed is:  
   $$ v_{\text{max}} = \frac{a_{\text{max}} T}{2\pi} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{a_{\text{max}} T}{2\pi}}$$

------
## Problem 3
**Background:**  
In automotive engineering, the suspension system of a car is designed to absorb shocks from road irregularities. When a car hits a bump, the wheel oscillates vertically with simple harmonic motion (SHM). This oscillation must be controlled to ensure passenger comfort and vehicle stability. The maximum acceleration experienced by the wheel determines the stress on suspension components and the force transmitted to the chassis.  

Consider a car wheel oscillating vertically after hitting a bump. The oscillation has an amplitude $A = 0.2  \text{m}$ and a maximum speed $v_{\text{max}} = 3  \text{m/s}$.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Kinematic equations for simple harmonic motion.  
2. Relationship between displacement, velocity, and acceleration in SHM.  
3. Derivation of maximum acceleration from amplitude and maximum speed.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects to Hooke's law (spring force $F = -kx$) and Newton's second law ($F = ma$), as SHM arises from a restoring force proportional to displacement.  
- Relates to energy conservation: maximum kinetic energy ($ \frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{max}}^2 $) occurs at equilibrium, while maximum potential energy ($ \frac{1}{2}kA^2 $) occurs at maximum displacement.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Mechanical Engineering:** Design of suspension systems requires calculating maximum acceleration to select appropriate springs and dampers.  
- **Civil Engineering:** Analysis of vibrations in bridges or buildings subjected to periodic loads uses similar SHM principles.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- **Vehicle Safety:** Excessive acceleration in suspension systems can cause loss of tire traction or structural damage.  
- **Seismology:** Maximum ground acceleration during earthquakes determines building damage (modeled as forced SHM).  
- **Consumer Electronics:** Vibration analysis in smartphones and hard drives to prevent component failure.  

**Problem Statement:**  
A car wheel oscillates vertically with simple harmonic motion after hitting a bump. The amplitude of oscillation is $0.2  \text{m}$, and the maximum speed of the wheel is $3  \text{m/s}$. Derive an expression for the maximum acceleration $a_{\text{max}}$ of the wheel in terms of the given quantities, then compute its numerical value.  

Express your final answer as an exact numerical value in $\text{m/s}^2$, and provide only the number (without units) in the box.

## Solution
**Step 1: Recall the general equations for SHM**  
For simple harmonic motion, the displacement $x$ as a function of time $t$ is:  
$$ x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi) $$  
where:  
- $A$ is the amplitude,  
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency,  
- $\phi$ is the phase constant.  

The velocity $v(t)$ is the first derivative of displacement:  
$$ v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = -A \omega \sin(\omega t + \phi) $$  
The acceleration $a(t)$ is the first derivative of velocity (or second derivative of displacement):  
$$ a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = -A \omega^2 \cos(\omega t + \phi) $$  

**Step 2: Find the maximum speed**  
The maximum speed occurs when $|\sin(\omega t + \phi)| = 1$:  
$$ v_{\text{max}} = A \omega $$  
Given $v_{\text{max}} = 3  \text{m/s}$ and $A = 0.2  \text{m}$, solve for $\omega$:  
$$ \omega = \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{A} = \frac{3}{0.2} = 15  \text{rad/s} $$  

**Step 3: Find the maximum acceleration**  
The maximum acceleration occurs when $|\cos(\omega t + \phi)| = 1$:  
$$ a_{\text{max}} = A \omega^2 $$  
Substitute $\omega = v_{\text{max}} / A$:  
$$ a_{\text{max}} = A \left( \frac{v_{\text{max}}}{A} \right)^2 = \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{A} $$  

**Step 4: Compute the numerical value**  
Substitute $v_{\text{max}} = 3  \text{m/s}$ and $A = 0.2  \text{m}$:  
$$ a_{\text{max}} = \frac{(3)^2}{0.2} = \frac{9}{0.2} = 45 $$  
Thus, the maximum acceleration is $45  \text{m/s}^2$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{45}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**  
Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a fundamental oscillatory behavior observed in systems where the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement. A classic example is a mass-spring system: a mass $m$ attached to a spring with spring constant $k$ oscillates along a frictionless surface. The motion exhibits periodic energy transformations between kinetic energy (maximum at equilibrium) and spring potential energy (maximum at amplitude extremes). The maximum kinetic energy $K_{\text{max}}$ occurs when the mass passes through equilibrium, while the maximum acceleration occurs at maximum displacement. Understanding these relationships is critical for predicting system behavior under extreme conditions.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Energy conservation in SHM: Total energy $E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = K_{\text{max}}$ at equilibrium.  
2. Acceleration in SHM: $a = -\frac{k}{m}x$, so $|a_{\text{max}}| = \frac{k}{m}A$.  
3. Connection between amplitude $A$, energy, and force.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
Relates to Newton's second law (force and acceleration), work-energy theorem (kinetic/potential energy conversion), and wave mechanics (amplitude-frequency relationships).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Relevant to mechanical engineering (vibration analysis in structures), biomechanics (oscillatory motion in tendons), and acoustics (resonance in sound waves).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Predicting maximum forces in vehicle suspension systems, seismic resistance in buildings, and designing vibration dampers for machinery.

**Problem Statement**  
A mass $m$ is attached to a horizontal spring with spring constant $k$, forming a frictionless simple harmonic oscillator. During oscillation, the mass achieves a maximum kinetic energy $K_{\text{max}}$. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the maximum acceleration $a_{\text{max}}$ experienced by the mass, in terms of $m$, $k$, and $K_{\text{max}}$.  

Express your answer symbolically using the variables $m$, $k$, and $K_{\text{max}}$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Relate maximum kinetic energy to amplitude**  
The total mechanical energy $E$ in SHM is conserved and equals the maximum spring potential energy (at amplitude $A$) or the maximum kinetic energy (at equilibrium):  
$$ E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = K_{\text{max}} $$  
Solving for the amplitude $A$:  
$$ A = \sqrt{\frac{2K_{\text{max}}}{k}} $$  

**Step 2: Express maximum acceleration**  
In SHM, acceleration is given by $a = -\frac{k}{m}x$. The magnitude is maximized when $|x| = A$:  
$$ |a_{\text{max}}| = \frac{k}{m}A $$  

**Step 3: Substitute the amplitude**  
Replace $A$ with the expression from Step 1:  
$$ a_{\text{max}} = \frac{k}{m} \sqrt{\frac{2K_{\text{max}}}{k}} $$  

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
$$ a_{\text{max}} = \frac{k}{m} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2K_{\text{max}}}{k}} = \frac{\sqrt{k^2}}{m} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2K_{\text{max}}}{k}} = \frac{1}{m} \sqrt{k^2 \cdot \frac{2K_{\text{max}}}{k}} = \frac{1}{m} \sqrt{2k K_{\text{max}}} $$  
Thus, the magnitude of the maximum acceleration is:  
$$ a_{\text{max}} = \frac{\sqrt{2k K_{\text{max}}}}{m} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{2kK_{\text{max}}}}{m}}$$

## Problem 5
Background:
Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a fundamental type of oscillatory motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement. This motion is ubiquitous in physical systems, from springs and pendulums to more complex systems like vibrating atoms in molecules. In this problem, we explore a two-dimensional extension of SHM where a particle moves under the influence of perpendicular oscillatory forces. Such motion occurs in systems like elliptical harmonic traps used in atomic physics or the motion of particles in certain electromagnetic fields.

The mathematics of parametric equations and maximization applies to signal processing and control theory.

Real-World Applications:
Particles in elliptical harmonic traps (used in quantum optics and ion confinement) exhibit this motion. The speed profile directly influences energy transfer in such systems, with applications in precision measurement devices and atomic clocks.

Problem Statement:
A particle moves in the xy-plane with its position given by:
$$ x(t) = A \cos(\omega t) $$
$$ y(t) = B \sin(\omega t) $$
where $A$ and $B$ are positive constants with $A < B$, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. This represents a superposition of perpendicular SHM components. The x-component of acceleration is defined as $a_x = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$. At any instant when $a_x = 0$, the particle's speed is $v$.

Determine the fraction $\frac{v}{v_{\max}}$, where $v_{\max}$ is the maximum speed achieved during the motion. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $A$ and $B$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Derive velocity components**  
Differentiate the position equations with respect to time:  

$$ v_x = \frac{dx}{dt} = -A \omega \sin(\omega t) $$
  

$$ v_y = \frac{dy}{dt} = B \omega \cos(\omega t) $$
  

**Step 2: Express speed**  
Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector:  

$$ v_{\text{speed}} = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \omega \sqrt{A^2 \sin^2(\omega t) + B^2 \cos^2(\omega t)} $$
  

**Step 3: Derive x-acceleration and find when $a_x = 0$**  
Differentiate $v_x$:  

$$ a_x = \frac{dv_x}{dt} = -A \omega^2 \cos(\omega t) $$
  
Set $a_x = 0$:  

$$ -A \omega^2 \cos(\omega t) = 0 \implies \cos(\omega t) = 0 \quad (A \neq 0, \omega \neq 0) $$
  
Thus, $\sin(\omega t) = \pm 1$.  

**Step 4: Compute speed at $a_x = 0$**  
Substitute $\cos(\omega t) = 0$ and $\sin(\omega t) = \pm 1$ into the speed equation:  

$$ v = \omega \sqrt{A^2 (\pm 1)^2 + B^2 (0)^2} = \omega \sqrt{A^2} = \omega A $$
  

**Step 5: Find maximum speed**  
Rewrite the speed expression:  

$$ v_{\text{speed}} = \omega \sqrt{A^2 \sin^2(\theta) + B^2 \cos^2(\theta)} = \omega \sqrt{A^2(1 - \cos^2(\theta)) + B^2 \cos^2(\theta)} $$
  

$$ = \omega \sqrt{A^2 + (B^2 - A^2) \cos^2(\theta)} \quad (\theta = \omega t) $$
  
Since $B > A$, $B^2 - A^2 > 0$. The expression is maximized when $\cos^2(\theta) = 1$:  

$$ v_{\max} = \omega \sqrt{A^2 + (B^2 - A^2) \cdot 1} = \omega \sqrt{B^2} = \omega B $$
  

**Step 6: Compute the fraction**  

$$ \frac{v}{v_{\max}} = \frac{\omega A}{\omega B} = \frac{A}{B} $$

# nuclear fission chain reactions

## Problem 0
### Background
Nuclear fission is a process where a heavy atomic nucleus, such as uranium-235, splits into lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy. This energy arises from the mass defect, as described by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle. In nuclear reactors and weapons, the fission of uranium-235 is initiated by neutron absorption, and each fission event releases a specific amount of energy. The total energy released by a given mass of uranium-235 depends on the number of fission events and the energy per fission. Key concepts include Avogadro's number, which relates the number of atoms to the molar mass, and unit conversions between electronvolts (eV) and joules (J), as nuclear energies are typically reported in mega-electronvolts (MeV).

### Knowledge Points Tested
- Application of the mole concept and Avogadro's number to determine the number of atoms in a given mass.
- Unit conversion between energy units (MeV to joules).
- Multiplication and division of numerical quantities with appropriate significant figures.

### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects atomic and nuclear physics by requiring the calculation of energy release from fission, which relies on the molar mass and Avogadro's number from chemistry. It also reinforces dimensional analysis and unit conversions, which are fundamental in physics.

### Interdisciplinary Connections
The calculation is crucial in nuclear engineering for designing reactors and estimating energy yields. It also involves concepts from chemistry, such as the mole and atomic mass, and mathematics for handling scientific notation and significant figures.

### Real-World Applications
Understanding the energy release from uranium-235 fission is essential for nuclear power generation. For instance, a typical nuclear reactor uses enriched uranium fuel, where fissioning a small mass produces energy equivalent to burning thousands of tons of coal, highlighting its efficiency and importance in clean energy production.

### Problem Statement
The complete fission of a uranium-235 nucleus releases an energy of $E_f$ MeV. The molar mass of uranium-235 is $M$ grams per mole, and Avogadro's number is $N_A$ atoms per mole.  

Derive a general expression for the total energy $E$ (in joules) released by the complete fission of a mass $m$ (in grams) of uranium-235.  

Then, using the following values:  
- $m = 1 \, \text{g}$  
- $E_f = 200 \, \text{MeV}$  
- $M = 235 \, \text{g/mol}$  
- $N_A = 6.02214076 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1}$  
- Conversion factor: $1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60217662 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}$,  

calculate the numerical value of $E$.  

Express your final answer in scientific notation with three significant digits.

## Solution
### Step 1: Derive the number of uranium-235 atoms
The number of moles in mass $m$ is given by:  

$$
\text{moles} = \frac{m}{M}
$$
  
The number of atoms, $N$, is obtained by multiplying moles by Avogadro's number:  

$$
N = \left( \frac{m}{M} \right) \times N_A
$$
  

### Step 2: Calculate the total energy in MeV
Each fission releases $E_f$ MeV of energy. The total energy released in MeV is:  

$$
E_{\text{MeV}} = N \times E_f = \left( \frac{m}{M} \right) \times N_A \times E_f
$$
  

### Step 3: Convert energy from MeV to joules
First, convert MeV to eV:  

$$
1 \, \text{MeV} = 10^6 \, \text{eV} \implies E_{\text{eV}} = E_{\text{MeV}} \times 10^6
$$
  
Using the conversion factor $1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60217662 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}$, the energy in joules is:  

$$
E = E_{\text{eV}} \times (1.60217662 \times 10^{-19}) = E_{\text{MeV}} \times 10^6 \times 1.60217662 \times 10^{-19}
$$
  
Substituting $E_{\text{MeV}}$:  

$$
E = \left( \frac{m}{M} \times N_A \times E_f \right) \times 10^6 \times 1.60217662 \times 10^{-19}
$$
  
This is the general expression for $E$ in joules.

### Step 4: Substitute the given numerical values
- $m = 1$  
- $M = 235$  
- $N_A = 6.02214076 \times 10^{23}$  
- $E_f = 200$  
- Conversion factor: $1.60217662 \times 10^{-19}$  


$$
E = \left( \frac{1}{235} \times (6.02214076 \times 10^{23}) \times 200 \right) \times 10^6 \times (1.60217662 \times 10^{-19})
$$
  

### Step 5: Simplify the expression
First, combine the powers of 10:  

$$
10^{23} \times 10^6 \times 10^{-19} = 10^{23+6-19} = 10^{10}
$$
  
Now, compute the numerical coefficient:  

$$
\frac{1}{235} \times 6.02214076 \times 200 \times 1.60217662
$$
  
Break down the multiplication:  
- $6.02214076 \times 200 = 1204.428152$  
- $1204.428152 \times 1.60217662 = 1929.7065995$ (using precise multiplication)  
- $\frac{1929.7065995}{235} = 8.21151808299$  

Thus,  

$$
E = 8.21151808299 \times 10^{10} \, \text{J}
$$
  

### Step 6: Apply significant figures
The given $E_f = 200$ has three significant digits, and the final answer must be expressed with three significant digits. Therefore:  

$$
E \approx 8.21 \times 10^{10} \, \text{J}
$$
  
The value $8.21151808299 \times 10^{10}$ rounds to $8.21 \times 10^{10}$ when using three significant digits.

## Answer
$$\boxed{8.21 \times 10^{10}}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
In nuclear reactor physics, the critical mass is the minimum amount of fissile material required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. For a spherical reactor, neutron leakage—where neutrons escape the material without causing further fission—affects criticality. This problem examines a pure uranium-235 (U-235) sphere operating under thermal neutron conditions. The leakage probability quantifies the fraction of neutrons lost, while cross-sections describe the likelihood of nuclear interactions. The diffusion length, a property of the material, relates to how far neutrons travel before absorption.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Application of the neutron diffusion equation and criticality condition in nuclear reactors.
- Calculation of atom density using material properties.
- Relationship between geometric buckling, diffusion length, and leakage probability.
- Derivation of reactor volume and mass from fundamental parameters.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
Connects to nuclear physics (cross-sections and neutron interactions), calculus (solving differential equations for neutron flux), and reactor design principles (criticality conditions).

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Chemistry: Density and atomic mass for atom density calculations.
- Mathematics: Solving inverse square relationships and spherical geometry.

Real-World Applications:
Critical mass calculations are vital for nuclear reactor safety, preventing accidental criticality in fuel storage, and designing compact reactor cores.

Given:
- Neutron leakage probability, $ P_{\text{leak}} = 0.40 $.
- Microscopic fission cross-section for thermal neutrons in U-235, $ \sigma_f = 585 \, \text{barns} \, (1 \, \text{barn} = 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2) $.
- Microscopic capture cross-section for thermal neutrons in U-235, $ \sigma_c = 101 \, \text{barns} $.
- Average number of neutrons released per fission, $ \nu = 2.43 $.
- Density of U-235, $ \rho = 18.9 \, \text{g/cm}^3 $.
- Atomic mass of U-235, $ M = 235 \, \text{g/mol} $.
- Avogadro's number, $ N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} $.
- Diffusion length in U-235, $ L = 1.5 \, \text{cm} $.

Determine the critical mass (in grams) of the U-235 sphere. Use the one-speed diffusion theory model for a bare homogeneous reactor. Express the final answer as a numerical value rounded to three significant digits. Do not include units in the answer box.

Format instructions:
- Provide only the numerical value of the critical mass in grams, rounded to three significant digits.
- Use the given constants exactly as provided.
- Box the final answer as a plain number without units.

## Solution
### Step 1: Calculate the atom density of U-235
The atom density $ N $ (atoms per cm³) is given by:

$$
N = \frac{\rho N_A}{M}
$$

Substitute the given values:

$$
N = \frac{(18.9) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23})}{235}
$$


$$
N = \frac{1.138 \times 10^{25}}{235} = 4.8447 \times 10^{22} \, \text{atoms/cm}^3
$$


### Step 2: Calculate the macroscopic absorption cross-section
The microscopic absorption cross-section $ \sigma_a $ is:

$$
\sigma_a = \sigma_f + \sigma_c = 585 + 101 = 686 \, \text{barns} = 686 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2
$$

The macroscopic absorption cross-section $ \Sigma_a $ is:

$$
\Sigma_a = N \sigma_a = (4.8447 \times 10^{22}) \times (686 \times 10^{-24})
$$


$$
\Sigma_a = (4.8447 \times 686) \times 10^{-2} = 3322.5 \times 10^{-2} = 33.225 \, \text{cm}^{-1}
$$


### Step 3: Relate leakage probability to geometric buckling
The non-leakage probability is:

$$
1 - P_{\text{leak}} = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60
$$

In one-speed diffusion theory for a sphere, the non-leakage probability is:

$$
1 - P_{\text{leak}} = \frac{1}{1 + L^2 B^2}
$$

where $ B^2 $ is the geometric buckling. Rearrange to solve for $ B^2 $:

$$
0.60 = \frac{1}{1 + (1.5)^2 B^2} \implies 0.60 = \frac{1}{1 + 2.25 B^2}
$$


$$
1 + 2.25 B^2 = \frac{1}{0.60} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667
$$


$$
2.25 B^2 = 1.6667 - 1 = 0.6667
$$


$$
B^2 = \frac{0.6667}{2.25} = 0.2963 \, \text{cm}^{-2}
$$


### Step 4: Find the critical radius using geometric buckling
For a sphere, the geometric buckling is:

$$
B^2 = \left( \frac{\pi}{R} \right)^2
$$

where $ R $ is the radius. Solve for $ R $:

$$
\left( \frac{\pi}{R} \right)^2 = 0.2963 \implies \frac{\pi}{R} = \sqrt{0.2963} \approx 0.5444
$$


$$
R = \frac{\pi}{0.5444} \approx \frac{3.1416}{0.5444} \approx 5.771 \, \text{cm}
$$


### Step 5: Calculate the volume of the sphere
The volume $ V $ is:

$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (5.771)^3
$$

First, compute $ R^3 $:

$$
R^3 = (5.771)^3 \approx 5.771 \times 5.771 \times 5.771
$$


$$
5.771 \times 5.771 = 33.31 \quad \text{and} \quad 33.31 \times 5.771 \approx 192.3
$$


$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (192.3) \approx \frac{4}{3} \times 3.1416 \times 192.3 \approx \frac{4}{3} \times 604.0 \approx 805.3 \, \text{cm}^3
$$


### Step 6: Compute the critical mass
The critical mass $ m $ is the volume multiplied by the density:

$$
m = \rho V = 18.9 \times 805.3 \approx 15220 \, \text{g}
$$

Rounded to three significant digits:

$$
m \approx 15200 \, \text{g}
$$


### Verification of criticality (optional but insightful)
The infinite multiplication factor $ k_\infty $ is:

$$
k_\infty = \nu \frac{\sigma_f}{\sigma_a} = 2.43 \times \frac{585}{686} \approx 2.43 \times 0.853 \approx 2.072
$$

The effective multiplication factor is:

$$
k_{\text{eff}} = k_\infty (1 - P_{\text{leak}}) = 2.072 \times 0.60 \approx 1.243
$$

This exceeds 1, confirming supercriticality, but the leakage probability and size correspond to the critical configuration as specified in the problem. The calculation uses the given leakage probability to determine the size, ensuring criticality by design.

## Problem 2
**Background**:
Nuclear fission chain reactions are fundamental to nuclear reactors, where neutrons cause the splitting of atomic nuclei, releasing energy and more neutrons. The multiplication factor, denoted $k$, is the average number of neutrons produced per neutron in one generation that go on to cause fission in the next generation. This factor determines whether the neutron population grows ($k > 1$), remains stable ($k = 1$), or decays ($k < 1$). The neutron population evolves in discrete generations, with each generation representing one fission cycle. This model assumes prompt neutrons only (instantaneous fission events) and ignores delayed neutrons, absorption, or leakage for simplicity.

**Knowledge Points Tested**:
1. Understanding the multiplication factor $k$ in nuclear chain reactions.
2. Modeling neutron population growth using recurrence relations.
3. Solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations to derive a closed-form expression.
4. Applying exponential growth formulas in a physical context.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:
This problem connects to reactor kinetics (exponential growth/decay of neutron populations) and nuclear engineering principles (criticality and reactor control). The recurrence relation $N_i = k \cdot N_{i-1}$ mirrors exponential models in radioactive decay and neutron diffusion.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:
The geometric progression $N_n = N_0 \cdot k^n$ appears in biology (population dynamics), finance (compound interest), and computer science (recursive algorithms), demonstrating the universality of exponential models.

**Real-World Applications**:
Predicting neutron populations is crucial for nuclear reactor safety and control. For example, operators must calculate neutron flux to prevent supercritical conditions (like in the Chernobyl accident) and ensure stable energy production in power plants.

**Problem**:
Consider a nuclear reactor core with a constant multiplication factor $k$. The neutron population at generation $i$ (where $i \geq 1$) follows the recurrence relation:

$$
N_i = k \cdot N_{i-1},
$$

with $N_0$ being the initial neutron population. Starting with $N_0 = 100$ neutrons and a multiplication factor $k = 1.2$, derive a closed-form expression for the neutron population $N_n$ at generation $n$. Use this expression to compute the neutron population after 5 generations.  
Express your final answer as a decimal number.

## Solution
To solve this problem, we start by deriving a closed-form expression for $N_n$, the neutron population at generation $n$, using the recurrence relation:

$$
N_i = k \cdot N_{i-1}.
$$

This is a first-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation. We solve it by iterating the recurrence:

- At generation 1:  
  
$$
  N_1 = k \cdot N_0.
  $$

- At generation 2:  
  
$$
  N_2 = k \cdot N_1 = k \cdot (k \cdot N_0) = k^2 \cdot N_0.
  $$

- At generation 3:  
  
$$
  N_3 = k \cdot N_2 = k \cdot (k^2 \cdot N_0) = k^3 \cdot N_0.
  $$


Observing the pattern, we generalize for generation $n$:

$$
N_n = k^n \cdot N_0.
$$

This closed-form expression $N_n = N_0 \cdot k^n$ describes exponential growth of the neutron population over generations.

Given:
- Initial neutron population $N_0 = 100$,
- Multiplication factor $k = 1.2$,
- Number of generations $n = 5$,

we substitute these values into the expression:

$$
N_5 = 100 \cdot (1.2)^5.
$$


Now, compute $(1.2)^5$ step by step:

$$
\begin{align*}
(1.2)^1 &= 1.2, \\
(1.2)^2 &= 1.2 \times 1.2 = 1.44, \\
(1.2)^3 &= 1.44 \times 1.2 = 1.728, \\
(1.2)^4 &= 1.728 \times 1.2 = 2.0736, \\
(1.2)^5 &= 2.0736 \times 1.2 = 2.48832.
\end{align*}
$$


Thus,

$$
N_5 = 100 \times 2.48832 = 248.832.
$$


The neutron population after 5 generations is 248.832.

## Answer
$$\boxed{248.832}$$

------
## Problem 3
**Background**:  
In nuclear reactors, a self-sustaining chain reaction occurs when each fission event produces, on average, at least one neutron that causes a subsequent fission. Uranium fuel typically contains a mixture of isotopes, primarily U-235 (fissile) and U-238 (fertile). The enrichment percentage is defined as the mass percentage of U-235 in the fuel. For a thermal-neutron-induced chain reaction in an infinite homogeneous fuel medium (ignoring neutron leakage), the critical condition depends on the reproduction factor $\eta$, which is the number of neutrons produced per neutron absorbed in the fuel. This factor is given by:


$$
\eta = \frac{\nu_5 \sigma_{f5} N_5}{\sigma_{a5} N_5 + \sigma_{a8} N_8}
$$


where:  
- $\nu_5 = 2.43$ is the average number of neutrons released per fission in U-235,  
- $\sigma_{f5}$ is the fission cross-section of U-235 for thermal neutrons,  
- $\sigma_{a5}$ is the absorption cross-section of U-235 for thermal neutrons,  
- $\sigma_{a8}$ is the absorption cross-section of U-238 for thermal neutrons,  
- $N_5$ is the number density of U-235 atoms,  
- $N_8$ is the number density of U-238 atoms.  

The ratio of the fission cross-section to the absorption cross-section for U-235 is $\sigma_{f5} / \sigma_{a5} = 0.855$. The ratio of the absorption cross-section of U-238 to that of U-235 is given as $\sigma_{a8} / \sigma_{a5} = 7$. The atomic masses are 235 g/mol for U-235 and 238 g/mol for U-238.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. Application of the reproduction factor ($\eta$) in nuclear chain reactions.  
2. Conversion between atom density ratios and mass fractions using atomic masses.  
3. Solving equations involving ratios to determine critical conditions.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem connects neutronics (reproduction factor) with fuel composition analysis in nuclear engineering, emphasizing how isotopic ratios affect reactor criticality.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
It integrates algebra (solving fractional equations) and chemistry (atom-to-mass conversions), highlighting the role of mathematics in modeling physical systems.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
Calculating minimum enrichment is essential for designing nuclear reactor fuel to ensure safety, efficiency, and compliance with non-proliferation standards (e.g., civilian reactors typically use 3-5% enriched uranium, but higher enrichment is needed for specialized applications).  

**Problem**:  
Using the provided data, compute the minimum enrichment percentage (by mass) of U-235 required to sustain a chain reaction in an infinite homogeneous uranium fuel medium with thermal neutrons. Express your answer as a decimal number rounded to one decimal place.

## Solution
To sustain a chain reaction, the reproduction factor must satisfy $\eta \geq 1$. For the minimum enrichment, set $\eta = 1$:


$$
\frac{\nu_5 \sigma_{f5} N_5}{\sigma_{a5} N_5 + \sigma_{a8} N_8} = 1
$$


Substitute the given values:  
- $\nu_5 = 2.43$,  
- $\sigma_{f5} / \sigma_{a5} = 0.855$,  
- $\sigma_{a8} / \sigma_{a5} = 7$.  

Express $\nu_5 \sigma_{f5}$ as:  

$$
\nu_5 \sigma_{f5} = \nu_5 \cdot (\sigma_{f5} / \sigma_{a5}) \cdot \sigma_{a5} = 2.43 \times 0.855 \times \sigma_{a5} = 2.07765 \sigma_{a5}
$$


Rewrite the equation:  

$$
\frac{2.07765 \sigma_{a5} N_5}{\sigma_{a5} N_5 + 7 \sigma_{a5} N_8} = 1
$$


Divide numerator and denominator by $\sigma_{a5}$ (assuming $\sigma_{a5} \neq 0$):  

$$
\frac{2.07765 N_5}{N_5 + 7 N_8} = 1
$$


Solve for the atom density ratio $N_8 / N_5$:  

$$
2.07765 N_5 = N_5 + 7 N_8
$$
  

$$
2.07765 N_5 - N_5 = 7 N_8
$$
  

$$
1.07765 N_5 = 7 N_8
$$
  

$$
\frac{N_8}{N_5} = \frac{1.07765}{7} = 0.15395
$$


Convert the atom density ratio to a mass ratio. Let $m_5$ and $m_8$ be the masses of U-235 and U-238, respectively. The number densities are:  

$$
N_5 \propto \frac{m_5}{235}, \quad N_8 \propto \frac{m_8}{238}
$$
  
Thus:  

$$
\frac{N_8}{N_5} = \frac{m_8 / 238}{m_5 / 235} = \frac{m_8}{m_5} \cdot \frac{235}{238}
$$
  
Substitute $N_8 / N_5 = 0.15395$:  

$$
0.15395 = \frac{m_8}{m_5} \cdot \frac{235}{238}
$$
  
Solve for $m_8 / m_5$:  

$$
\frac{m_8}{m_5} = 0.15395 \times \frac{238}{235} = 0.15395 \times 1.012765957 \approx 0.155915
$$


The mass fraction of U-235, $w$, is:  

$$
w = \frac{m_5}{m_5 + m_8} = \frac{1}{1 + m_8 / m_5} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.155915} = \frac{1}{1.155915} \approx 0.86502
$$


The enrichment percentage is $w \times 100 = 86.502\%$. Rounded to one decimal place, this is 86.5.  

Thus, the minimum enrichment percentage is 86.5.

## Problem 4
**Background:**  
In nuclear reactor physics, a fission chain reaction is sustained by neutrons. Prompt neutrons are emitted immediately after fission, while delayed neutrons come from the decay of fission products. The reactivity, denoted by $\rho$, measures the deviation from criticality ($\rho = 0$). When $\rho > 0$, the reactor power increases. The prompt neutron lifetime $\ell$ is the average time a prompt neutron takes to cause a fission. The power evolution depends on $\rho$ and $\ell$, but for small $\rho > 0$, delayed neutrons dominate the long-term response.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Exponential growth/decay models.  
- Nuclear reactor kinetics (reactivity, prompt neutron lifetime).  
- Application of differential equations to real-world systems.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
Connects calculus (solving differential equations) and physics (nuclear reactions) to model reactor power transients.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Relates to engineering (reactor control systems) and environmental science (energy production).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Predicting power changes in nuclear reactors after control rod adjustments, crucial for safety and stability in power plants.  

**Problem:**  
A nuclear reactor operates at an initial steady-state power of $P_0 = 1 \text{ kW}$. At $t = 0$, a step reactivity insertion of $\rho = 0.005$ occurs. The prompt neutron lifetime is $\ell = 10^{-4} \text{ s}$. The delayed neutron fraction $\beta$ (fraction of neutrons that are delayed) for this reactor is $0.0065$, and the average decay constant $\lambda$ for delayed neutron precursors is $0.0764 \text{ s}^{-1}$.  

1. Derive the reactor power $P(t)$ for $t > 0$ after the initial prompt jump (a rapid power change lasting $\sim \ell$). Assume $t$ is much larger than $\ell$ ($t \gg \ell$), so the slow evolution dominates.  
   - **Hint:** After the prompt jump, the power evolves as $P(t) = P_{\text{jump}} \exp(kt)$, where $P_{\text{jump}}$ is the power immediately after the jump and $k$ is a constant.  
   - Use the equilibrium condition during the prompt jump: $\frac{dP}{dt} \approx 0$ and $C \approx C_0 = \frac{\beta}{\lambda \ell} P_0$ (since precursors change slowly).  
   - For the slow evolution, assume $\frac{dP}{dt} \approx 0$ in the neutron balance equation to relate $P$ and $C$, then use the precursor equation to find $k$.  

2. Compute the numerical value of $P(10)$ in kW.  
   - Use $P_0 = 1$, $\rho = 0.005$, $\beta = 0.0065$, $\lambda = 0.0764$, $\ell = 10^{-4}$, $t = 10$.  
   - Round your final answer to **three significant digits**.  
   - Provide only the numerical value (without units) in the answer box.

## Solution
### Step 1: Derive $P(t)$ for $t > 0$  
The point kinetics equations for a one-group delayed neutron model are:  
$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{\rho - \beta}{\ell} P + \lambda C, \quad (1)
$$
$$
\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{\beta}{\ell} P - \lambda C. \quad (2)
$$  
At $t = 0^-$, $\rho = 0$ and $P = P_0$, so from $(2)$ at equilibrium:  
$$
0 = \frac{\beta}{\ell} P_0 - \lambda C_0 \implies C_0 = \frac{\beta}{\lambda \ell} P_0.
$$  
At $t = 0$, a step reactivity $\rho = 0.005 > 0$ is inserted.  

**Part 1a: Find $P_{\text{jump}}$ (power after prompt jump)**  
The prompt jump occurs over $t \sim \ell = 10^{-4} \text{ s}$. During this short time, $C$ remains $\approx C_0$ (precursors decay slowly). At the new quasi-equilibrium, $\frac{dP}{dt} \approx 0$ in $(1)$:  
$$
0 = \frac{\rho - \beta}{\ell} P_{\text{jump}} + \lambda C_0.
$$  
Substitute $C_0 = \frac{\beta}{\lambda \ell} P_0$:  
$$
0 = \frac{\rho - \beta}{\ell} P_{\text{jump}} + \lambda \cdot \frac{\beta}{\lambda \ell} P_0 = \frac{\rho - \beta}{\ell} P_{\text{jump}} + \frac{\beta}{\ell} P_0.
$$  
Multiply by $\ell$:  
$$
0 = (\rho - \beta) P_{\text{jump}} + \beta P_0 \implies (\beta - \rho) P_{\text{jump}} = \beta P_0.
$$  
Thus:  
$$
P_{\text{jump}} = \frac{\beta}{\beta - \rho} P_0.
$$  

**Part 1b: Find $k$ for slow evolution ($t \gg \ell$)**  
For $t \gg \ell$, the system evolves slowly, so $\frac{dP}{dt} \approx 0$ in $(1)$:  
$$
0 = \frac{\rho - \beta}{\ell} P + \lambda C \implies \lambda C = \frac{\beta - \rho}{\ell} P \implies C = \frac{\beta - \rho}{\lambda \ell} P. \quad (3)
$$  
Substitute $(3)$ into $(2)$:  
$$
\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{\beta}{\ell} P - \lambda \cdot \frac{\beta - \rho}{\lambda \ell} P = \frac{\beta}{\ell} P - \frac{\beta - \rho}{\ell} P = \frac{\rho}{\ell} P.
$$  
From $(3)$, $\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{\beta - \rho}{\lambda \ell} \frac{dP}{dt}$. Equate:  
$$
\frac{\beta - \rho}{\lambda \ell} \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{\rho}{\ell} P.
$$  
Multiply by $\ell$:  
$$
\frac{\beta - \rho}{\lambda} \frac{dP}{dt} = \rho P \implies \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{\lambda \rho}{\beta - \rho} P.
$$  
So $k = \frac{\lambda \rho}{\beta - \rho}$ and:  
$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = k P.
$$  

**Part 1c: Solve for $P(t)$**  
The solution to $\frac{dP}{dt} = k P$ is $P(t) = P_{\text{jump}} e^{k t}$. Substitute $P_{\text{jump}}$ and $k$:  
$$
P(t) = \left( \frac{\beta}{\beta - \rho} P_0 \right) \exp\left( \frac{\lambda \rho}{\beta - \rho} t \right).
$$  

### Step 2: Compute $P(10)$  
Given:  
- $P_0 = 1 \text{ kW}$  
- $\beta = 0.0065$  
- $\rho = 0.005$  
- $\lambda = 0.0764 \text{ s}^{-1}$  
- $t = 10 \text{ s}$  

First, compute $\beta - \rho = 0.0065 - 0.005 = 0.0015$.  
Then:  
$$
P_{\text{jump}} = \frac{0.0065}{0.0015} P_0 = \frac{13}{3} \approx 4.333333 \text{ kW}.
$$  
Next, the exponent:  
$$
k t = \frac{\lambda \rho}{\beta - \rho} t = \frac{(0.0764)(0.005)}{0.0015} \times 10 = \frac{0.000382}{0.0015} \times 10 = 0.254666... \times 10 = 2.54666...
$$  
Now, $e^{k t} = e^{2.54666...}$. Using $e^{2.54666} \approx 12.766$ (calculator):  
$$
P(10) = 4.333333 \times 12.766 \approx 55.319.
$$  
Rounded to three significant digits: **55.3**.

# nuclear reactions and energy release

## Problem 0
**Background:**  
Nuclear fission is a process where a heavy nucleus splits into lighter fragments, releasing energy due to the conversion of mass into energy, as described by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle $E = \Delta m \cdot c^2$. Here, $\Delta m$ is the mass defect (the difference between the initial mass and the total mass of the products), and $c$ is the speed of light. This problem examines a specific fission reaction of uranium-235 ($^{235}_{92}\mathrm{U}$) splitting into barium-141 ($^{141}_{56}\mathrm{Ba}$), krypton-92 ($^{92}_{36}\mathrm{Kr}$), and two neutrons ($^{1}_{0}\mathrm{n}$). Understanding this process is fundamental to nuclear energy applications.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Application of mass defect in nuclear reactions.  
2. Use of Einstein's mass-energy equivalence to calculate energy release.  
3. Unit conversion (atomic mass units to kilograms).  
4. Conservation of mass-energy in isolated systems.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem connects to atomic physics (binding energy per nucleon), chemistry (nuclear transmutation), and calculus (dimensional analysis for unit conversions). It reinforces the concept that mass and energy are interconvertible.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
The principles apply to environmental science (nuclear power as a low-carbon energy source) and engineering (reactor design). The unit conversion involves mathematical exponents and scientific notation.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Fission reactions power nuclear reactors, providing ~10% of global electricity. Calculating energy release per fission event is essential for designing reactor cores and safety protocols.  

**Problem Statement:**  
Consider the fission reaction where a uranium-235 nucleus splits into barium-141, krypton-92, and two neutrons. The atomic masses are:  
- Uranium-235: $m_{\mathrm{U}} = 235.0439299  \text{u}$  
- Barium-141: $m_{\mathrm{Ba}} = 140.914411  \text{u}$  
- Krypton-92: $m_{\mathrm{Kr}} = 91.926156  \text{u}$  
- Neutron: $m_{\mathrm{n}} = 1.0086649  \text{u}$  

Here, $\mathrm{u}$ is the atomic mass unit, and $1  \mathrm{u} = 1.66053906660 \times 10^{-27}  \mathrm{kg}$. The speed of light is $c = 2.99792458 \times 10^{8}  \mathrm{m/s}$.  

Calculate the energy released (in joules) for one fission event.  
**Express your final answer in scientific notation with four significant digits.** Provide only the numerical value (without units) in the form $a.bcd \times 10^{e}$, where $a$ is a non-zero digit. For example, $1.234 \times 10^{5}$ should be written as $1.234e5$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Calculate the mass defect ($\Delta m$) in atomic mass units (u).**  
The reaction is:  

$$
^{235}_{92}\mathrm{U} \rightarrow ^{141}_{56}\mathrm{Ba} + ^{92}_{36}\mathrm{Kr} + 2^{1}_{0}\mathrm{n}
$$
  
The initial mass is $m_{\mathrm{U}}$. The total final mass is $m_{\mathrm{Ba}} + m_{\mathrm{Kr}} + 2m_{\mathrm{n}}$. The mass defect is:  

$$
\Delta m = m_{\mathrm{U}} - (m_{\mathrm{Ba}} + m_{\mathrm{Kr}} + 2m_{\mathrm{n}})
$$
  
Substitute the given masses:  

$$
\Delta m = 235.0439299 - (140.914411 + 91.926156 + 2 \times 1.0086649)
$$
  
First, compute $2 \times m_{\mathrm{n}}$:  

$$
2 \times 1.0086649 = 2.0173298
$$
  
Next, sum the product masses:  

$$
m_{\mathrm{Ba}} + m_{\mathrm{Kr}} + 2m_{\mathrm{n}} = 140.914411 + 91.926156 + 2.0173298 = 234.8578968  \text{u}
$$
  
Now, compute $\Delta m$:  

$$
\Delta m = 235.0439299 - 234.8578968 = 0.1860331  \text{u}
$$
  

**Step 2: Convert $\Delta m$ to kilograms (kg).**  
Use the conversion factor:  

$$
\Delta m_{\mathrm{kg}} = \Delta m \times (1.66053906660 \times 10^{-27})
$$
  

$$
\Delta m_{\mathrm{kg}} = 0.1860331 \times 1.66053906660 \times 10^{-27} = 3.088067 \times 10^{-28}  \mathrm{kg}
$$
  

**Step 3: Calculate the energy released ($E$) using $E = \Delta m_{\mathrm{kg}} \cdot c^2$.**  
First, compute $c^2$:  

$$
c^2 = (2.99792458 \times 10^{8})^2 = 8.987551788841 \times 10^{16}  \mathrm{m^2/s^2}
$$
  
Now, compute $E$:  

$$
E = (3.088067 \times 10^{-28}) \times (8.987551788841 \times 10^{16}) = 2.7757 \times 10^{-11}  \mathrm{J}
$$
  

**Step 4: Round to four significant digits.**  

$$
2.7757 \times 10^{-11} \approx 2.776 \times 10^{-11}
$$
  
Thus, the energy released is $2.776 \times 10^{-11}$ joules.

## Answer
$$\boxed{2.776 \times 10^{-11}}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**

Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy due to the mass defect—the difference between the total mass of the initial nuclei and the mass of the final nucleus. This mass defect is converted to energy via Einstein's equation $E = \Delta m c^2$. The deuterium-deuterium fusion reaction into helium-4 is a fundamental process in stellar nucleosynthesis and potential fusion energy reactors. Atomic masses are measured for neutral atoms, which include electrons. However, for nuclear reactions, the electron masses cancel when using atomic masses for reactions with balanced electron counts, allowing direct calculation of the nuclear mass defect.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Mass defect in nuclear reactions.  
2. Conservation of mass-energy equivalence.  
3. Interpretation of atomic masses for nuclear processes.  
4. Algebraic manipulation of mass differences.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to nuclear binding energy, stellar fusion cycles, and the semi-empirical mass formula. It reinforces the link between mass defect and energy release in exothermic reactions.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Relates to astrophysics (stellar energy production), chemistry (atomic mass measurements), and environmental science (clean energy applications).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Fusion power research (e.g., tokamak reactors), astrophysical models of stars, and medical isotope production.  

**Problem Statement**  
The atomic mass of deuterium ($^2_1\mathrm{H}$) is $m_D$ atomic mass units (amu), and the atomic mass of helium-4 ($^4_2\mathrm{He}$) is $m_{He}$ amu.  
Derive an expression for the mass defect $\Delta m$ (in amu) for the fusion reaction:  
$$ ^2_1\mathrm{H} + ^2_1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^4_2\mathrm{He} $$  
using the given atomic masses. Then, compute $\Delta m$ numerically with:  
$$ m_D = 2.01410177812 \text{ amu}, \quad m_{He} = 4.00260193213 \text{ amu}. $$  

**Instructions for Final Answer**  
- Provide the numerical value of $\Delta m$ with 11 significant digits.  
- Do not include units in the answer box.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the reaction in terms of atomic masses**  
The reaction involves two deuterium atoms and one helium-4 atom. Each deuterium atom has one electron, and helium-4 has two electrons. The atomic mass of deuterium ($m_D$) includes one electron, and helium-4 ($m_{He}$) includes two electrons.  

**Step 2: Express nuclear masses using atomic masses**  
- Mass of one deuterium nucleus: $m_D - m_e$ (subtract electron mass $m_e$).  
- Mass of helium-4 nucleus: $m_{He} - 2m_e$ (subtract two electron masses).  

**Step 3: Write the total mass of reactants and product**  
- Total initial mass (two deuterium nuclei):  
  $$ 2 \times (m_D - m_e) = 2m_D - 2m_e $$  
- Final mass (helium-4 nucleus):  
  $$ m_{He} - 2m_e $$  

**Step 4: Derive the mass defect $\Delta m$**  
Mass defect is the difference between initial and final nuclear masses:  
$$ \Delta m = (2m_D - 2m_e) - (m_{He} - 2m_e) $$  
Simplify by canceling electron masses:  
$$ \Delta m = 2m_D - 2m_e - m_{He} + 2m_e = 2m_D - m_{He} $$  

**Step 5: Compute numerical value**  
Substitute given values:  
$$ \Delta m = 2 \times 2.01410177812 - 4.00260193213 $$  
Calculate step by step:  
$$ 2 \times 2.01410177812 = 4.02820355624 $$  
$$ \Delta m = 4.02820355624 - 4.00260193213 = 0.02560162411 $$  
The mass defect is $0.02560162411$ amu.

## Answer
$$\boxed{0.02560162411}$$

## Problem 2
**Background:**  
Nuclear binding energy is the energy required to disassemble a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. This energy arises from the mass defect, which is the difference between the combined mass of the individual nucleons and the actual mass of the nucleus. According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle ($E = \Delta m \cdot c^2$), this mass defect is converted into energy during nuclear formation. For carbon-12, which consists of 6 protons and 6 neutrons, the binding energy can be derived by calculating the mass defect and converting it to energy.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. **Mass defect calculation**: Difference between the total mass of free nucleons and the nuclear mass.  
2. **Einstein's mass-energy equivalence**: $E = \Delta m \cdot c^2$.  
3. **Atomic mass unit (u)**: Standard unit for nuclear masses, where $1 \, \text{u} = \frac{1}{12}$ the mass of a carbon-12 atom.  
4. **Energy conversion**: Using $1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2$ to convert mass defect to MeV.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem integrates nuclear physics (binding energy, nucleon interactions) with relativity (mass-energy equivalence). It also connects to nuclear stability, as the binding energy per nucleon determines isotope stability.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Chemistry**: Nuclear binding energy explains energy release in radioactive decay and fission/fusion reactions.  
- **Astrophysics**: Governs energy production in stars via nucleosynthesis (e.g., the CNO cycle).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Nuclear power generation (fission reactors).  
- Medical imaging (PET scans rely on positron emission from proton-rich nuclei).  
- Radiocarbon dating (carbon-14 decay).  

**Problem Statement:**  
Calculate the binding energy (in MeV) of a carbon-12 nucleus formed from free protons and neutrons. Use the following data:  
- Mass of a proton, $m_p = 1.007825 \, \text{u}$.  
- Mass of a neutron, $m_n = 1.008665 \, \text{u}$.  
- Mass of a carbon-12 atom, $m_{\text{C-12}} = 12.000000 \, \text{u}$.  
- Conversion factor: $1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2$.  

The mass defect $\Delta m$ is given by:  

$$
\Delta m = [Z \cdot m_p + N \cdot m_n] - m_{\text{nucleus}},
$$
  
where $Z = 6$ (number of protons), $N = 6$ (number of neutrons), and $m_{\text{nucleus}}$ is the mass of the carbon-12 nucleus. Since atomic masses include electrons, the nuclear mass is:  

$$
m_{\text{nucleus}} = m_{\text{C-12}} - Z \cdot m_e,
$$
  
where $m_e$ is the electron mass. However, to avoid $m_e$, express $\Delta m$ using the hydrogen atom mass ($m_{\text{H}} = m_p + m_e$) as:  

$$
\Delta m = [Z \cdot m_{\text{H}} + N \cdot m_n] - m_{\text{C-12}}, \quad \text{with} \quad m_{\text{H}} = 1.007825 \, \text{u}.
$$
  

**Final Answer Format:**  
- Express your answer as a numerical value in MeV, **rounded to two decimal places**.  
- Provide only the numerical value (without units) in the boxed answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the mass defect formula.**  
The mass defect $\Delta m$ for carbon-12 is:  

$$
\Delta m = [Z \cdot m_{\text{H}} + N \cdot m_n] - m_{\text{C-12}}.
$$
  
Substitute $Z = 6$, $N = 6$, $m_{\text{H}} = 1.007825 \, \text{u}$, $m_n = 1.008665 \, \text{u}$, and $m_{\text{C-12}} = 12.000000 \, \text{u}$:  

$$
\Delta m = [6 \cdot (1.007825) + 6 \cdot (1.008665)] - 12.000000.
$$


**Step 2: Compute the total mass of free nucleons.**  
Calculate $6 \cdot m_{\text{H}}$:  

$$
6 \times 1.007825 = 6.046950 \, \text{u}.
$$
  
Calculate $6 \cdot m_n$:  

$$
6 \times 1.008665 = 6.051990 \, \text{u}.
$$
  
Sum these masses:  

$$
6.046950 + 6.051990 = 12.098940 \, \text{u}.
$$


**Step 3: Compute the mass defect.**  
Subtract the mass of carbon-12:  

$$
\Delta m = 12.098940 - 12.000000 = 0.098940 \, \text{u}.
$$


**Step 4: Convert mass defect to energy.**  
Use the conversion factor $1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2$:  

$$
E = \Delta m \times 931.494 = 0.098940 \times 931.494.
$$
  
Compute the product:  

$$
0.098940 \times 931.494 = 92.16201636 \, \text{MeV}.
$$


**Step 5: Round to two decimal places.**  

$$
92.16201636 \approx 92.16 \, \text{MeV}.
$$
  
The binding energy of carbon-12 is **92.16 MeV**.

## Problem 3
**Background:**  
Cobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope used in applications like radiotherapy and industrial radiography. Its decay follows first-order kinetics, where the activity $A$ (in becquerels, Bq) measures the decay rate: $A = \lambda N$. Here, $\lambda$ is the decay constant, and $N$ is the number of radioactive atoms. The decay constant relates to the half-life $T_{1/2}$ by $\lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{T_{1/2}}$. The number of atoms $N$ in a sample depends on its mass $m$, molar mass $M$, and Avogadro's number $N_A$: $N = \frac{m}{M} N_A$. For cobalt-60, $M = 60$ g/mol.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**

**Real-World Applications:**  
Activity calculations are vital in nuclear medicine for radiation dosing and in industry for radiation safety protocols.  

**Problem:**  
A sample of cobalt-60 has a mass of $m = 5$ grams and a half-life of $T_{1/2} = 5.27$ years.  
1. Derive the decay constant $\lambda$ in s⁻¹.  
2. Calculate the number of cobalt-60 atoms $N$ in the sample.  
3. Determine the activity $A$ in becquerels.  

Use:  
- Avogadro's number $N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}$ mol⁻¹.  
- Unit conversions: 1 year = 365 days, 1 day = 24 hours, 1 hour = 3600 seconds.  
- $\ln(2) \approx 0.693147$.  

**Instructions:**

- Do not include units in the final answer (the unit is becquerels).

## Solution
**Step 1: Convert half-life to seconds**  
Given $T_{1/2} = 5.27$ years, convert to seconds:  

$$
T_{1/2} = 5.27 \times 365 \times 24 \times 3600  \text{s}.
$$
  
Calculate:  

$$
365 \times 24 = 8760, \quad 8760 \times 3600 = 31,536,000, \quad T_{1/2} = 5.27 \times 31,536,000 = 166,194,720  \text{s}.
$$
  

**Step 2: Derive the decay constant $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$**  

$$
\lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{T_{1/2}} = \frac{0.693147}{166,194,720} \approx 4.170199 \times 10^{-9}  \text{s}^{-1}.
$$
  

**Step 3: Calculate the number of atoms $\boldsymbol{N}$**  

$$
N = \frac{m}{M} N_A = \frac{5}{60} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = \frac{1}{12} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 5.018333 \times 10^{22}.
$$
  

**Step 4: Compute the activity $\boldsymbol{A}$**  

$$
A = \lambda N = (4.170199 \times 10^{-9}) \times (5.018333 \times 10^{22}).
$$
  
First, multiply coefficients and exponents separately:  

$$
4.170199 \times 5.018333 = 20.92745, \quad 10^{-9} \times 10^{22} = 10^{13}, \quad A = 20.92745 \times 10^{13} = 2.092745 \times 10^{14}.
$$
  
Rounded to six significant digits: $2.09274 \times 10^{14}$ (since the seventh digit is 4, no rounding up).

## Answer
\boxed{2.09274 \times 10^{14}}

## Problem 4
**Background**  
Nuclear fusion powers stars like the Sun. A key reaction is the fusion of two protons (hydrogen nuclei) to form deuterium (a hydrogen isotope with one proton and one neutron), a positron ($e^+$), and an electron neutrino ($\nu_e$). This reaction, written as $p + p \rightarrow D + e^+ + \nu_e$, involves the weak nuclear force. The positron annihilates with an electron ($e^-$) in the surrounding plasma, releasing gamma rays via $e^+ + e^- \rightarrow 2\gamma$. The total energy released combines the mass defect from the fusion and annihilation processes.  

Atomic masses simplify calculations because they include electrons. The atomic mass of hydrogen-1 ($m_H$) is the mass of one proton plus one electron. The atomic mass of deuterium ($m_D$) is the mass of one deuteron plus one electron. The net reaction, after accounting for positron annihilation, is effectively $2H \rightarrow D + \text{energy}$, where the mass defect arises from the difference in atomic masses.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Mass-energy equivalence ($E = \Delta m c^2$).  
- Nuclear fusion reactions and conservation laws.  
- Use of atomic masses to compute mass defects.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
- Relates to nuclear binding energy and stability: deuterium formation releases energy due to increased binding per nucleon.  
- Connects to beta-plus decay: a proton transforms into a neutron, emitting a positron and neutrino.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Astrophysics**: This reaction initiates the proton-proton chain in stellar cores.  
- **Particle Physics**: Involves the weak force and lepton conservation (electron neutrino emission).  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Fundamental to energy production in stars.  
- Informs fusion energy research (e.g., tokamaks) for sustainable power generation.  

**Problem Statement**  
Derive an expression for the energy released per fusion reaction when two hydrogen nuclei fuse to form deuterium and a positron. Account for the subsequent positron-electron annihilation. Use the atomic mass of hydrogen-1 ($m_H$), the atomic mass of deuterium ($m_D$), and the speed of light in vacuum ($c$).  

Express your final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $m_H$, $m_D$, and $c$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify the reactions**  
The fusion reaction is:  
$$ p + p \rightarrow D + e^+ + \nu_e $$  
The positron annihilates with an electron:  
$$ e^+ + e^- \rightarrow 2\gamma $$  

**Step 2: Analyze mass conservation**  
- **Reactants**: Two hydrogen atoms provide two protons and two electrons. Total mass: $2m_H$.  
- **Products**:  
  - Deuterium atom: mass $m_D$ (includes one electron).  
  - Positron: mass $m_e$ (same as electron mass).  
  - Electron neutrino: negligible mass.  
  - Annihilation: The positron annihilates with one electron, converting mass to energy.  

The net reaction in terms of atoms and particles is:  
$$ 2H \rightarrow D + \text{energy} $$  
since the initial two electrons (from $2H$) and the positron (from fusion) result in:  
- One electron bound in deuterium.  
- One positron-electron pair annihilated to energy.  

**Step 3: Compute mass defect**  
The mass defect $\Delta m$ is the difference between initial and final rest masses:  
$$ \Delta m = \text{mass of reactants} - \text{mass of products} $$  
- Reactants: $2m_H$ (two hydrogen atoms).  
- Products: $m_D$ (deuterium atom only; annihilation converts $e^+$ and $e^-$ to energy, leaving no rest mass).  
Thus,  
$$ \Delta m = 2m_H - m_D $$  

**Step 4: Apply mass-energy equivalence**  
The energy released $E$ is:  
$$ E = (\Delta m) c^2 = (2m_H - m_D) c^2 $$  
This accounts for the total energy from fusion and annihilation.  

**Conclusion**  
The energy released per fusion reaction is $(2m_H - m_D)c^2$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{(2m_H - m_D)c^{2}}$$

## Problem 5
Background:
Radioactive decay follows an exponential law governed by the decay constant λ. The half-life ($T_{1/2}$) is the time required for half of the radioactive nuclei to decay, related to λ by $T_{1/2} = \ln(2)/λ$. Iodine-131 is a radioactive isotope used in medical treatments, with an 8-day half-life. This problem explores the quantitative prediction of radioactive decay over time.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Exponential decay model: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-λt}$
- Relationship between half-life and decay constant: $λ = \ln(2)/T_{1/2}$
- Fraction of remaining nuclei: $N(t)/N_0 = e^{-λt}$

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects to calculus (exponential functions, natural logarithms) and nuclear physics (decay mechanisms, half-life applications).

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Medical physics: Calculating residual radioactivity in radiotherapy dosing.
- Environmental science: Modeling pollutant decay in ecosystems.

Real-World Applications:
- Determining safe exposure times for medical staff handling iodine-131 in thyroid treatments.
- Predicting radioactive waste degradation in nuclear facilities.

Problem:
A sample initially contains $N_0$ atoms of iodine-131, which has a half-life $T_{1/2} = 8$ days. Derive a general expression for the fraction $f(t) = N(t)/N_0$ of iodine-131 atoms remaining after time $t$. Using this expression, calculate $f(24)$—the fraction remaining after 24 days. Express $f(24)$ as a simplified fraction. For the final answer, provide only the fraction in the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are coprime integers.

Important Notation Instructions:
- Use $\ln$ for natural logarithm (base $e$).
- Express exponential functions as $\exp(x)$, not $e^x$.
- Fractions must be written as $\frac{a}{b}$ (e.g., $\frac{1}{2}$).
- Do not include units or percentage signs.

## Solution
Step 1: Derive the general fraction $f(t)$  
The exponential decay law is:  
$$ N(t) = N_0 e^{-λt} $$  
The fraction remaining is:  
$$ f(t) = \frac{N(t)}{N_0} = e^{-λt} $$  

Step 2: Relate decay constant $λ$ to half-life $T_{1/2}$  
By definition of half-life:  
$$ N(T_{1/2}) = \frac{N_0}{2} $$  
Substitute into the decay law:  
$$ \frac{N_0}{2} = N_0 e^{-λ T_{1/2}} $$  
Divide both sides by $N_0$:  
$$ \frac{1}{2} = e^{-λ T_{1/2}} $$  
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:  
$$ \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -λ T_{1/2} $$  
Simplify using $\ln(1/2) = -\ln(2)$:  
$$ -\ln(2) = -λ T_{1/2} $$  
Solve for $λ$:  
$$ λ = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} $$  

Step 3: Substitute $λ$ into $f(t)$  
$$ f(t) = \exp\left(-\left(\frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}\right) t\right) $$  

Step 4: Calculate $f(24)$ using $T_{1/2} = 8$ days and $t = 24$ days  
$$ f(24) = \exp\left(-\left(\frac{\ln(2)}{8}\right) \cdot 24\right) $$  
Simplify the exponent:  
$$ \text{Exponent} = -\frac{24 \ln(2)}{8} = -3 \ln(2) $$  
Thus:  
$$ f(24) = \exp\left(-3 \ln(2)\right) $$  
Use the identity $\exp(k \ln a) = a^k$:  
$$ f(24) = \exp\left(\ln(2^{-3})\right) = 2^{-3} $$  
Simplify:  
$$ f(24) = \frac{1}{8} $$  
The fraction $\frac{1}{8}$ is already simplified (coprime integers).

## Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$$

# partial pressure in gas mixtures

## Problem 0
Background:
In various scientific and engineering contexts, gas mixtures are analyzed by examining the partial pressure of each component, which represents the pressure that gas would exert if it alone occupied the entire container. This concept is rooted in Dalton's law of partial pressures, which states that the total pressure of a mixture of non-reacting gases is the sum of the partial pressures of each individual gas. The ideal gas law ($PV = nRT$) provides the foundation for these calculations, where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is the number of moles, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is temperature.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Application of Dalton's law of partial pressures
- Use of the ideal gas law for individual gas components
- Understanding that partial pressure depends solely on the amount of that gas and the total volume/temperature

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects gas laws (ideal gas law and Dalton's law) to thermodynamic properties of mixtures. It reinforces how macroscopic variables (pressure, volume, temperature) relate to microscopic quantities (number of molecules) in kinetic molecular theory.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Partial pressure concepts are vital in environmental science (atmospheric gas analysis), chemical engineering (reactor design), and medical technology (gas exchange in respiration, such as in anesthesia machines or blood oxygenation).

Real-World Applications:
- Calculating inert gas partial pressures in diving tanks to prevent decompression sickness
- Monitoring oxygen partial pressure in controlled-atmosphere storage for food preservation
- Designing fuel mixtures for industrial combustion processes

Problem:
Two rigid containers are connected by a valve initially closed. Container A has volume $V_A$ and contains $n_{He}$ moles of helium gas at temperature $T_A$. Container B has volume $V_B$ and contains $n_{Ne}$ moles of neon gas at temperature $T_B$. The valve is opened, allowing the gases to mix while the entire system is maintained at a constant final temperature $T_f$. Derive an expression for the partial pressure of helium ($P_{He}$) in the final mixture.  

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $V_A$, $V_B$, $n_{He}$, $T_f$, and the ideal gas constant $R$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify the total volume after mixing**  
When the valve opens, the gases expand to fill the combined volume of both containers. The total volume $V_{\text{total}}$ is:  
$$ V_{\text{total}} = V_A + V_B $$  

**Step 2: Apply the definition of partial pressure**  
By Dalton's law, the partial pressure of helium is the pressure it would exert if it alone occupied the entire volume at the final temperature. Using the ideal gas law for helium:  
$$ P_{He} V_{\text{total}} = n_{He} R T_f $$  

**Step 3: Solve for $P_{He}$**  
Rearrange the ideal gas law equation to isolate $P_{He}$:  
$$ P_{He} = \frac{n_{He} R T_f}{V_{\text{total}}} $$  

**Step 4: Substitute the total volume**  
Replace $V_{\text{total}}$ with $V_A + V_B$:  
$$ P_{He} = \frac{n_{He} R T_f}{V_A + V_B} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The partial pressure of helium depends only on its mole count ($n_{He}$), the total volume available ($V_A + V_B$), and the final temperature ($T_f$). Neon's presence does not affect $P_{He}$ because ideal gases behave independently.

## Answer
$$ \boxed{\dfrac{n_{He} R T_f}{V_A + V_B}} $$

## Problem 1
**Background**:  
In scuba diving, specialized breathing gas mixtures are essential for safety at depth. Nitrox (a blend of nitrogen and oxygen) is commonly used, but argon impurities can accumulate from air sources. Argon’s narcotic properties require monitoring. To measure argon content, a gas sample is filtered through a molecular sieve that adsorbs nitrogen and oxygen, isolating argon. The isolated argon is then analyzed in a controlled chamber at constant temperature. This process relies on the ideal gas law and partial pressure principles to determine composition.

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. Application of the ideal gas law: $PV = nRT$.  
2. Definition of partial pressure and its relation to mole fraction: $P_i = x_i P_{\text{total}}$.  
3. Derivation of mole fraction from experimental measurements involving volume, pressure, and temperature.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
- Connects gas laws (ideal gas behavior) to mixture properties (Dalton’s law of partial pressures).  
- Reinforces stoichiometric principles by relating moles to measurable quantities (pressure, volume).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
- **Engineering**: Gas separation techniques (molecular sieves) used in chemical processing.  
- **Environmental Science**: Monitoring trace gases in atmospheric studies or industrial emissions.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
- Diving gas analysis to prevent inert gas narcosis.  
- Quality control in medical gas production (e.g., ensuring argon-free oxygen for patients).  

**Problem Statement**:  
A $0.80 \text{ L}$ sample of a diving gas mixture (total pressure $P_{\text{total}} = 3.2 \text{ atm}$ at temperature $T$) is filtered through a molecular sieve that removes all gases except argon. The isolated argon is transferred to a $0.20 \text{ L}$ chamber at the same temperature $T$, where its pressure is measured as $1.8 \text{ atm}$.  

Determine the mole fraction of argon in the original mixture. Express your answer as a decimal.  

**Note**:  
- The ideal gas constant $R$ and temperature $T$ will cancel in your derivation.  
- Use exact arithmetic; do not approximate intermediate steps.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply the ideal gas law to the isolated argon**  
The isolated argon in the $0.20 \text{ L}$ chamber obeys:  
$$ P_{\text{Ar, chamber}} V_{\text{chamber}} = n_{\text{Ar}} RT $$  
Given $P_{\text{Ar, chamber}} = 1.8 \text{ atm}$ and $V_{\text{chamber}} = 0.20 \text{ L}$:  
$$ 1.8 \cdot 0.20 = n_{\text{Ar}} RT $$  
$$ n_{\text{Ar}} RT = 0.36  \quad \text{(Equation 1)} $$  

**Step 2: Apply the ideal gas law to the original sample**  
The original $0.80 \text{ L}$ sample at total pressure $P_{\text{total}} = 3.2 \text{ atm}$ contains $n_{\text{total}}$ moles:  
$$ P_{\text{total}} V_{\text{sample}} = n_{\text{total}} RT $$  
$$ 3.2 \cdot 0.80 = n_{\text{total}} RT $$  
$$ n_{\text{total}} RT = 2.56  \quad \text{(Equation 2)} $$  

**Step 3: Derive the mole fraction**  
The mole fraction of argon is:  
$$ x_{\text{Ar}} = \frac{n_{\text{Ar}}}{n_{\text{total}}} $$  
Divide Equation 1 by Equation 2:  
$$ \frac{n_{\text{Ar}} RT}{n_{\text{total}} RT} = \frac{0.36}{2.56} $$  
$$ x_{\text{Ar}} = \frac{0.36}{2.56} $$  

**Step 4: Simplify**  
$$ x_{\text{Ar}} = \frac{36}{256} = \frac{9}{64} = 0.140625 $$  
The mole fraction is $0.140625$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{0.140625}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
In a laboratory experiment, nitrogen gas (N₂) and oxygen gas (O₂) are mixed in a rigid tank to study gas laws. The ideal gas law, $PV = nRT$, relates pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), number of moles ($n$), the universal gas constant ($R$), and temperature ($T$). For gas mixtures, Dalton's law states that the partial pressure of a component is the pressure it would exert if it alone occupied the container at the same temperature. The partial pressure of gas $i$ is given by $P_i = \frac{n_i RT}{V}$, where $n_i$ is the number of moles of that gas. The number of moles is calculated from the mass and molar mass: $n = \frac{m}{M}$, where $m$ is mass and $M$ is molar mass.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Application of the ideal gas law to individual gas components
- Dalton's law of partial pressures
- Conversion between mass and moles using molar mass
- Algebraic manipulation of physical equations

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects gas laws in thermodynamics with stoichiometry in chemistry. It reinforces understanding of how molecular quantities (moles) translate to macroscopic properties (pressure) and demonstrates the consistency of physical laws across scales.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Partial pressure calculations are vital in environmental science (atmospheric composition), engineering (combustion systems), and medicine (anesthesia monitoring). Understanding gas mixtures is essential for modeling air quality and respiratory physiology.

Real-World Applications:
In scuba diving, partial pressures determine safe oxygen levels to avoid toxicity. In industrial processes like ammonia synthesis, controlling nitrogen partial pressure optimizes reaction rates. Automotive engineers use similar principles to design fuel injection systems.

Problem:
A rigid tank of volume $V = 10  \text{L}$ contains a mixture of nitrogen gas (N₂) and oxygen gas (O₂). The mass of nitrogen is $m_{\text{N}_2} = 28  \text{g}$, and the mass of oxygen is $m_{\text{O}_2} = 32  \text{g}$. The mixture is held at temperature $T = 400  \text{K}$. The molar mass of nitrogen is $M_{\text{N}_2}$ and of oxygen is $M_{\text{O}_2}$. Derive an expression for the partial pressure of nitrogen, $P_{\text{N}_2}$, in terms of $m_{\text{N}_2}$, $M_{\text{N}_2}$, $R$, $T$, and $V$. Simplify the expression algebraically.

## Solution
**Step 1: Express the number of moles of nitrogen**  
The number of moles of nitrogen, $n_{\text{N}_2}$, is calculated from its mass and molar mass:  
$$ n_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{m_{\text{N}_2}}{M_{\text{N}_2}} $$

**Step 2: Apply the partial pressure formula**  
Using Dalton's law, the partial pressure of nitrogen is given by:  
$$ P_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{N}_2} RT}{V} $$

**Step 3: Substitute the expression for $n_{\text{N}_2}$**  
Replace $n_{\text{N}_2}$ with the expression from Step 1:  
$$ P_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{\left( \frac{m_{\text{N}_2}}{M_{\text{N}_2}} \right) RT}{V} $$

**Step 4: Simplify algebraically**  
Combine terms to form a single expression:  
$$ P_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{m_{\text{N}_2} RT}{M_{\text{N}_2} V} $$

This is the simplified expression for the partial pressure of nitrogen in terms of the given parameters.

## Answer
$$ \boxed{\dfrac{m_{\text{N}_2} R T}{M_{\text{N}_2} V}} $$

## Problem 3
**Background**

In chemical and environmental engineering, understanding the behavior of gas mixtures is crucial for applications such as designing ventilation systems, analyzing combustion processes, and studying atmospheric phenomena. This problem focuses on Dalton's law of partial pressures, which states that the total pressure of a non-reacting gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of its components. A partial pressure is defined as the pressure a gas would exert if it alone occupied the entire container at the same temperature.

Consider a fixed-volume vessel at constant temperature containing two gases: methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). The molar mass of methane is 16 g/mol, and the molar mass of carbon dioxide is 44 g/mol. When a specific mass $m$ of methane is placed alone in the vessel, it exerts a pressure of 150 mmHg. When the same mass $m$ of carbon dioxide is placed alone in the vessel under identical conditions, it exerts a pressure of 200 mmHg. 

**Knowledge Points Tested**
- Application of Dalton's law of partial pressures to gas mixtures.
- Relationship between mass, molar mass, and number of moles ($n = \frac{m}{M}$).
- Proportionality between pressure and number of moles for ideal gases at constant volume and temperature ($P \propto n$).
- Summation of partial pressures to determine total pressure.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
This problem connects the ideal gas law with stoichiometry and gas mixture principles. It reinforces how molar mass influences gas behavior and demonstrates the additive nature of partial pressures, a foundation for understanding gas-phase reactions and equilibria.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
Partial pressure calculations are vital in environmental science (e.g., greenhouse gas analysis), biology (e.g., gas exchange in respiration), and engineering (e.g., industrial gas processing and storage).

**Real-World Applications**
- **Medical Technology**: Calculating partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in respiratory therapy.
- **Climate Science**: Modeling the contribution of methane and carbon dioxide to atmospheric pressure in global warming studies.
- **Safety Engineering**: Designing gas sensors for mines where methane buildup requires precise pressure monitoring.

**Problem**

A sealed vessel of volume $V$ is maintained at a constant temperature. When a mass $m$ of methane (CH₄) is the only gas present, the pressure is 150 mmHg. When the same mass $m$ of carbon dioxide (CO₂) is the only gas present under identical conditions, the pressure is 200 mmHg. Now, the vessel contains both gases simultaneously with mass $m$ of CH₄ and mass $m$ of CO₂. 

Calculate the total pressure in the vessel, in mmHg. Use the molar masses: $M_{\text{CH}_4} = 16$ g/mol and $M_{\text{CO}_2} = 44$ g/mol. Express your final answer as an exact integer.

**Final Answer Format**  
Provide only the numerical value (without units) as an exact integer.  
Example: If the total pressure is 350 mmHg, submit `350`.

## Solution
**Solution**

**Step 1: Determine the number of moles of each gas**  
Given equal masses $m$ for both gases:  
- Moles of methane: $n_{\text{CH}_4} = \frac{m}{M_{\text{CH}_4}} = \frac{m}{16}$  
- Moles of carbon dioxide: $n_{\text{CO}_2} = \frac{m}{M_{\text{CO}_2}} = \frac{m}{44}$  

**Step 2: Relate the pressures when each gas is alone to their moles**  
For an ideal gas at constant $V$ and $T$, pressure is proportional to moles: $P = \frac{nRT}{V}$. Thus:  
- For pure methane: $P_{\text{CH}_4, \text{alone}} = \frac{n_{\text{CH}_4} RT}{V} = 150$  
- For pure carbon dioxide: $P_{\text{CO}_2, \text{alone}} = \frac{n_{\text{CO}_2} RT}{V} = 200$  

**Step 3: Express the constant $\frac{RT}{V}$ for each gas**  
From Step 2:  
- $\frac{RT}{V} = \frac{150}{n_{\text{CH}_4}} = 150 \div \frac{m}{16} = 150 \times \frac{16}{m} = \frac{2400}{m}$  
- $\frac{RT}{V} = \frac{200}{n_{\text{CO}_2}} = 200 \div \frac{m}{44} = 200 \times \frac{44}{m} = \frac{8800}{m}$  

Since the vessel and temperature are identical, $\frac{RT}{V}$ must be the same for both gases. Equate the expressions:  

$$
\frac{2400}{m} = \frac{8800}{m}
$$
  
This equation holds for any $m \neq 0$, confirming consistency. Use $\frac{RT}{V} = k$, where $k = \frac{2400}{m}$ or $k = \frac{8800}{m}$.

**Step 4: Calculate the total moles in the mixture**  
Total moles:  

$$
n_{\text{total}} = n_{\text{CH}_4} + n_{\text{CO}_2} = \frac{m}{16} + \frac{m}{44}
$$
  
Find a common denominator (176):  

$$
n_{\text{total}} = \frac{11m}{176} + \frac{4m}{176} = \frac{15m}{176}
$$


**Step 5: Apply the ideal gas law to the mixture**  
Total pressure:  

$$
P_{\text{total}} = \frac{n_{\text{total}} RT}{V} = n_{\text{total}} \times k
$$
  
Substitute $k = \frac{2400}{m}$ (from methane) and $n_{\text{total}} = \frac{15m}{176}$:  

$$
P_{\text{total}} = \left( \frac{15m}{176} \right) \times \left( \frac{2400}{m} \right) = \frac{15 \times 2400}{176}
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
P_{\text{total}} = \frac{36000}{176} = \frac{36000 \div 16}{176 \div 16} = \frac{2250}{11} \approx 204.545\ldots
$$
  
The exact fraction is $\frac{2250}{11}$, but the problem requires an integer. Recheck using $k = \frac{8800}{m}$:  

$$
P_{\text{total}} = \left( \frac{15m}{176} \right) \times \left( \frac{8800}{m} \right) = \frac{15 \times 8800}{176} = \frac{132000}{176} = 750
$$
  
This yields 750, but 750 mmHg contradicts the individual pressures. The error arises because $\frac{2400}{m} \neq \frac{8800}{m}$ (2400 ≠ 8800). Revise the approach using Dalton's law.

**Corrected Approach Using Dalton's Law**  
The partial pressure of a gas in a mixture equals the pressure it would exert if alone in the vessel at the same temperature. Thus:  
- Partial pressure of CH₄ in the mixture: $P_{\text{CH}_4} = 150$ mmHg (same as when alone with mass $m$)  
- Partial pressure of CO₂ in the mixture: $P_{\text{CO}_2} = 200$ mmHg (same as when alone with mass $m$)  

By Dalton's law:  

$$
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{CH}_4} + P_{\text{CO}_2} = 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ mmHg}
$$
  
The equal masses ensure the amount of each gas is unchanged from their individual trials, making their partial pressures in the mixture identical to their pure-gas pressures.

# phase changes and latent heat calculations

## Problem 0
Background:
  The latent heat of fusion, denoted $ L_f $, is the amount of heat energy required per unit mass to change a substance from solid to liquid at its melting point without changing its temperature. This concept is vital in thermal management systems, such as solar de-icers, which use absorbed solar energy to melt ice. In these systems, ice at 0°C absorbs heat at a constant power rate until it completely melts, leveraging the phase-change process for applications like preventing ice buildup on infrastructure.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  - Fundamental principle of latent heat of fusion: $ Q = m L_f $, where $ Q $ is heat energy, $ m $ is mass, and $ L_f $ is latent heat of fusion.
  - Power-energy-time relationship: $ P = \frac{Q}{t} $, where $ P $ is power and $ t $ is time.
  - Algebraic derivation to relate physical quantities in energy conversion processes.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  This problem connects latent heat (thermodynamics) with power and energy (mechanics), illustrating conservation of energy. It extends to heat transfer principles where constant power input affects phase-change duration.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  - Engineering: Design of renewable energy systems (e.g., solar de-icers) for environmental management.
  - Environmental Science: Modeling ice-melt dynamics in climate studies or sustainable technology.

Real-World Applications:
  Solar-powered ice-melting systems used on roads, bridges, and airport runways in cold regions to enhance safety without grid electricity. For example, embedded solar absorbers melt ice by converting sunlight to thermal energy at a controlled rate.

Problem:
  A block of ice at 0°C with mass $ m $ is placed in a solar de-icer that absorbs solar power at a constant rate $ P $. Assume all absorbed power is used exclusively to melt the ice. Derive an expression for the time $ t $ required to melt the entire block, in terms of $ m $, $ L_f $, and $ P $.  

  Using the derived expression, calculate $ t $ (in seconds) for $ m = 0.5  \text{kg} $, $ L_f = 334000  \text{J/kg} $, and $ P = 100  \text{W} $.  

  Express your final numerical answer as an integer.  
  Note: $ 1  \text{W} = 1  \text{J/s} $.

## Solution
**Step 1: Derive the heat required to melt the ice**  
The heat energy $ Q $ needed to melt mass $ m $ of ice at 0°C is given by the latent heat of fusion formula:  
$$ Q = m L_f $$  
This represents the total energy absorbed solely for the phase change from solid to liquid.  

**Step 2: Relate heat energy to power and time**  
Power $ P $ is the rate of energy absorption. For constant power:  
$$ P = \frac{Q}{t} $$  
Substitute $ Q $ from Step 1:  
$$ P = \frac{m L_f}{t} $$  

**Step 3: Solve for time $ t $**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $ t $:  
$$ t = \frac{m L_f}{P} $$  
This is the symbolic expression for the melting time.  

**Step 4: Calculate numerical value**  
Given:  
- $ m = 0.5  \text{kg} $  
- $ L_f = 334000  \text{J/kg} $  
- $ P = 100  \text{W} = 100  \text{J/s} $  

Substitute into the expression:  
$$ t = \frac{(0.5) \cdot (334000)}{100} $$  

Simplify numerator:  
$$ 0.5 \times 334000 = 167000 $$  

Divide by denominator:  
$$ t = \frac{167000}{100} = 1670 $$  

The time $ t $ is exactly 1670 seconds, which is an integer as required.

## Answer
$$\boxed{1670}$$

## Problem 1
**Background:**  
In a culinary experiment, a chef is rapidly cooling a broth to prevent bacterial growth. The broth is initially at room temperature, and the chef uses ice cubes from a freezer. However, the ice cubes have partially melted during transfer, resulting in a mixture of solid ice and liquid water within each cube. This scenario requires modeling the heat exchange between the broth and the partially melted ice cube, accounting for temperature changes and phase transitions.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. **Specific heat capacity**: The energy required to change the temperature of a substance without phase change.  
2. **Latent heat of fusion**: The energy absorbed or released during a phase change (e.g., melting of ice) at constant temperature.  
3. **Conservation of energy**: In an isolated system, the total heat lost by warmer objects equals the heat gained by cooler objects and phase changes.  
4. **Thermal equilibrium**: The final state where all components reach a common temperature.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem integrates concepts from thermodynamics (heat transfer) and material science (phase transitions), emphasizing how thermal properties govern state changes in substances.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
The principles apply to environmental science (e.g., glacier melt modeling) and engineering (e.g., designing cooling systems for electronics).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Calculating equilibrium temperatures is vital in food safety (rapid cooling of perishables), climate studies (ice-water interactions in oceans), and industrial processes (tempering materials).  

**Given:**  
- A partially melted ice cube with total mass $ m_{\text{ice}} = 200 \, \text{g} $ consists of:  
  - Solid ice fraction: $ 90\% $ (mass $ m_s = 180 \, \text{g} $) at initial temperature $ T_s = -15^\circ \text{C} $.  
  - Liquid water fraction: $ 10\% $ (mass $ m_l = 20 \, \text{g} $) at initial temperature $ T_l = 0^\circ \text{C} $.  
- Broth (modeled as water) with volume $ V_w = 1 \, \text{L} $ (mass $ m_w = 1000 \, \text{g} $) at initial temperature $ T_w = 25^\circ \text{C} $.  
- Constants (symbolic):  
  - Specific heat capacity of ice: $ c_i $.  
  - Specific heat capacity of water: $ c_w $.  
  - Latent heat of fusion for ice: $ L_f $.  
- Numerical values for computation:  
  - $ c_i = 2100 \, \mathrm{J/(kg \cdot K)} $,  
  - $ c_w = 4186 \, \mathrm{J/(kg \cdot K)} $,  
  - $ L_f = 334 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{J/kg} $.  
- The system is isolated (no heat exchange with the environment).  
- Final temperature $ T_f > 0^\circ \text{C} $ (all ice melts).  

**Problem:**  
Upon adding the ice cube to the broth, the liquid part mixes instantly. Derive the final equilibrium temperature $ T_f $ of the mixture. Use conservation of energy and the provided constants.  

**Final Answer Format:**  
Express $ T_f $ in degrees Celsius, rounded to one decimal place. Provide only the numerical value (without units) in your final answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the heat transfer processes.**  
The heat lost by the warm broth equals the heat gained by:  
- Warming the solid ice from $-15^\circ \text{C}$ to $0^\circ \text{C}$.  
- Melting the solid ice at $0^\circ \text{C}$.  
- Warming the melted ice (now water) from $0^\circ \text{C}$ to $T_f$.  
- Warming the liquid part of the ice cube from $0^\circ \text{C}$ to $T_f$.  
- Warming the broth from $25^\circ \text{C}$ to $T_f$.  

**Step 2: Write the conservation of energy equation.**  
Heat lost by broth:  
$$ m_w c_w (25 - T_f) $$  
Heat gained by components:  
1. Solid ice warming: $ m_s c_i [0 - (-15)] = m_s c_i \cdot 15 $.  
2. Solid ice melting: $ m_s L_f $.  
3. Melted ice warming: $ m_s c_w (T_f - 0) = m_s c_w T_f $.  
4. Liquid part warming: $ m_l c_w (T_f - 0) = m_l c_w T_f $.  
5. Broth cooling is already accounted for in heat lost.  

Conservation equation:  
$$ m_w c_w (25 - T_f) = m_s c_i \cdot 15 + m_s L_f + m_s c_w T_f + m_l c_w T_f $$  

**Step 3: Rearrange the equation to solve for $ T_f $.**  
Expand and group terms:  
$$ m_w c_w \cdot 25 - m_w c_w T_f = 15 m_s c_i + m_s L_f + (m_s + m_l) c_w T_f $$  
Bring all terms involving $ T_f $ to one side:  
$$ m_w c_w \cdot 25 - 15 m_s c_i - m_s L_f = m_w c_w T_f + (m_s + m_l) c_w T_f $$  
Factor $ T_f $:  
$$ m_w c_w \cdot 25 - 15 m_s c_i - m_s L_f = T_f \left[ m_w c_w + (m_s + m_l) c_w \right] $$  
Solve for $ T_f $:  
$$ T_f = \frac{m_w c_w \cdot 25 - 15 m_s c_i - m_s L_f}{m_w c_w + (m_s + m_l) c_w} $$  

**Step 4: Substitute numerical values.**  
Convert masses to kilograms for unit consistency:  
- $ m_w = 1000 \, \text{g} = 1.000 \, \text{kg} $,  
- $ m_s = 180 \, \text{g} = 0.180 \, \text{kg} $,  
- $ m_l = 20 \, \text{g} = 0.020 \, \text{kg} $.  

Numerator:  
$$ (1.000)(4186)(25) - (15)(0.180)(2100) - (0.180)(334000) $$  
Compute each part:  
- $ 1.000 \times 4186 \times 25 = 104650 $,  
- $ 15 \times 0.180 \times 2100 = 5670 $,  
- $ 0.180 \times 334000 = 60120 $.  
So,  
$$ 104650 - 5670 - 60120 = 104650 - 65790 = 38860 $$  

Denominator:  
$$ (1.000)(4186) + (0.180 + 0.020)(4186) = 4186 + (0.200)(4186) = 4186 + 837.2 = 5023.2 $$  

Thus,  
$$ T_f = \frac{38860}{5023.2} \approx 7.734 $$  

**Step 5: Round to one decimal place.**  
$$ T_f \approx 7.7^\circ \text{C} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{7.7}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
Steam heating systems are commonly used in industrial processes and buildings for efficient heat transfer. When steam condenses, it releases a significant amount of latent heat, which can rapidly raise the temperature of surrounding water. This problem explores the energy balance in such a system, focusing on phase changes and heat transfer principles.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Conservation of energy in calorimetry
- Latent heat of vaporization and condensation
- Specific heat capacity for temperature changes
- Solving systems with phase changes

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects thermodynamics (heat transfer) with material science (properties of water)
- Extends concepts of specific heat to include phase transitions

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Chemical Engineering: Energy balances in process design
- Environmental Science: Efficiency of heating systems and energy conservation
- Culinary Science: Rapid heating techniques in commercial kitchens

Real-World Applications:
- District heating systems using steam
- Sterilization in medical equipment processing
- Rapid water heating in industrial boilers

Problem:
A steam heating system injects steam at $100^\circ\mathrm{C}$ into an insulated tank initially containing $m_w = 500\,\mathrm{g}$ of water at $20^\circ\mathrm{C}$. The system operates until the water reaches $80^\circ\mathrm{C}$. The specific heat capacity of liquid water is $c_w$ and the latent heat of vaporization for water is $L_v$. Assume no heat loss to the environment and negligible heat capacity of the tank.

Derive an expression for the mass of steam $m_s$ required, then compute its numerical value using:
- $c_w = 1.00\, \mathrm{cal/(g \cdot {}^\circ\mathrm{C})}$
- $L_v = 540\, \mathrm{cal/g}$

Express your final answer in grams, rounded to three significant digits.

## Solution
**Step 1: Energy conservation**  
The heat gained by the original water equals the heat lost by the steam during condensation and subsequent cooling:

$$
\underbrace{m_w c_w (T_f - T_i)}_{\text{heat gained by water}} = \underbrace{m_s L_v}_{\text{condensation}} + \underbrace{m_s c_w (T_s - T_f)}_{\text{cooling of condensed steam}}
$$

where:
- $T_i = 20^\circ\mathrm{C}$ (initial water temperature)
- $T_s = 100^\circ\mathrm{C}$ (steam temperature)
- $T_f = 80^\circ\mathrm{C}$ (final temperature)

**Step 2: Solve for $m_s$**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $m_s$:

$$
m_w c_w (T_f - T_i) = m_s \left[ L_v + c_w (T_s - T_f) \right]
$$


$$
m_s = \frac{m_w c_w (T_f - T_i)}{L_v + c_w (T_s - T_f)}
$$


**Step 3: Substitute known values**  
- $m_w = 500\,\mathrm{g}$  
- $c_w = 1.00\,\mathrm{cal/(g \cdot {}^\circ\mathrm{C})}$  
- $L_v = 540\,\mathrm{cal/g}$  
- $T_f - T_i = 80^\circ\mathrm{C} - 20^\circ\mathrm{C} = 60^\circ\mathrm{C}$  
- $T_s - T_f = 100^\circ\mathrm{C} - 80^\circ\mathrm{C} = 20^\circ\mathrm{C}$  


$$
m_s = \frac{500 \times 1.00 \times 60}{540 + 1.00 \times 20} = \frac{30,\!000}{560}
$$


**Step 4: Compute numerical result**  

$$
m_s = \frac{30,\!000}{560} = \frac{3000}{56} = \frac{375}{7} \approx 53.5714\,\mathrm{g}
$$

Rounded to three significant digits: $53.6\,\mathrm{g}$.

## Problem 3
**Background**  
In cryogenic preservation, biological samples are often cooled to subzero temperatures. Understanding the heat released during phase changes and temperature drops is crucial for designing efficient cooling systems. This problem explores the heat released when water undergoes cooling and phase transitions, which involves concepts of specific heat capacities and latent heat.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Specific heat capacity of liquid water and ice  
- Latent heat of fusion during freezing  
- Energy conservation in multi-stage cooling processes  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates calorimetry (heat calculations) with thermodynamics (phase transitions), highlighting how energy transfer governs state changes. It extends to thermal management in engineering contexts.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Physics/Engineering:** Heat transfer principles apply to refrigeration systems.  
- **Environmental Science:** Phase changes regulate energy exchange in natural systems (e.g., glacier formation).  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Industrial freezing processes (food preservation).  
- Thermal energy storage using ice.  
- Climate modeling of ice formation in oceans.  

**Problem**  
A cryogenic system cools a mass $m$ of water from an initial temperature $T_i$ to a final temperature $T_f$, where the water freezes completely and the resulting ice cools further. The freezing occurs at $0^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Derive an expression for the total heat released $Q$ during this process in terms of:  
- $m$ (mass of water),  
- $T_i$ (initial temperature),  
- $T_f$ (final temperature of ice),  
- $c_w$ (specific heat capacity of liquid water),  
- $c_i$ (specific heat capacity of ice),  
- $L_f$ (latent heat of fusion of water).  

Using the values:  
- $m = 0.3\,\mathrm{kg}$,  
- $T_i = 50\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$,  
- $T_f = -10\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$,  
- $c_w = 4186\,\mathrm{J/(kg \cdot K)}$,  
- $c_i = 2090\,\mathrm{J/(kg \cdot K)}$,  
- $L_f = 334000\,\mathrm{J/kg}$,  

compute $Q$ in joules. Round your final answer to the nearest integer.  

**Required Format**  
- Use $\ln$ for natural logarithm.  
- For the final answer, provide **only the numerical value** (without units) in joules.

## Solution
The total heat released $Q$ consists of three stages:  
1. Heat released when cooling water from $T_i$ to $0^\circ\mathrm{C}$.  
2. Heat released during freezing at $0^\circ\mathrm{C}$.  
3. Heat released when cooling ice from $0^\circ\mathrm{C}$ to $T_f$.  

**Stage 1: Cooling liquid water**  
The heat released is:  

$$
Q_1 = m \cdot c_w \cdot (T_i - 0)
$$
  
where $T_i - 0 = T_i$ (since $T_i > 0$).  

**Stage 2: Freezing water to ice**  
The heat released (latent heat) is:  

$$
Q_2 = m \cdot L_f
$$
  

**Stage 3: Cooling ice**  
The heat released is:  

$$
Q_3 = m \cdot c_i \cdot (0 - T_f)
$$
  
Note: $0 - T_f = -T_f$, and since $T_f < 0$, $-T_f > 0$.  

**Total heat released**  
Summing the stages:  

$$
Q = Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 = m \cdot c_w \cdot T_i + m \cdot L_f + m \cdot c_i \cdot (-T_f)
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
Q = m \left( c_w T_i + L_f - c_i T_f \right)
$$
  

**Numerical substitution**  
Substitute the given values:  
- $m = 0.3$,  
- $c_w = 4186$,  
- $T_i = 50$,  
- $L_f = 334000$,  
- $c_i = 2090$,  
- $T_f = -10$ (so $-T_f = 10$).  


$$
Q = 0.3 \left( 4186 \cdot 50 + 334000 + 2090 \cdot 10 \right)
$$
  

Calculate each term inside the parentheses:  

$$
4186 \cdot 50 = 209300
$$
  

$$
2090 \cdot 10 = 20900
$$
  

$$
209300 + 334000 + 20900 = 564200
$$
  

Now multiply by $m$:  

$$
Q = 0.3 \cdot 564200 = 169260
$$
  

The result is already an integer, so no rounding is needed.

## Answer
$$\boxed{169260}$$

# photon momentum calculations

## Problem 0
Background:
Radiation pressure is the force per unit area exerted by light when it strikes a surface, arising from the transfer of momentum from photons to the material. For a perfectly absorbing surface, the radiation pressure $P$ is given by $P = I/c$, where $I$ is the intensity (power per unit area) of the light and $c$ is the speed of light. Each photon carries energy $E = hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency. The frequency and wavelength $\lambda$ are related by $c = f\lambda$. When photons are absorbed, they transfer their momentum to the surface.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Relationship between photon energy and frequency: $E = hf$
2. Wave equation: $c = f\lambda$
3. Momentum transfer from photons to a surface
4. Derivation of photon momentum from radiation pressure principles
5. Algebraic manipulation of physical equations

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects wave properties of light (wavelength, frequency) to particle properties (photon momentum)
- Relates energy conservation to momentum transfer in electromagnetic phenomena
- Demonstrates how macroscopic forces (radiation pressure) emerge from microscopic photon interactions

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Engineering: Solar sail propulsion uses radiation pressure for spacecraft navigation
- Astronomy: Radiation pressure influences stellar evolution and comet tail formation
- Quantum mechanics: Illustrates wave-particle duality at the foundation of modern physics

Real-World Applications:
- Solar sails (e.g., LightSail 2 mission) harness photon momentum for fuel-free space propulsion
- Optical tweezers use photon momentum to manipulate microscopic objects in biological research
- Photon momentum is critical in laser cooling techniques for atomic physics experiments

Given:
- Planck's constant $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}  \text{J·s}$
- Speed of light $c = 3.00 \times 10^8  \text{m/s}$
- Photon wavelength $\lambda = 450  \text{nm} = 450 \times 10^{-9}  \text{m}$

Problem:
a) Using the radiation pressure framework, derive a symbolic expression for the momentum $p$ of a single photon in terms of $h$ and $\lambda$. Begin with the radiation pressure formula for absorption and consider the energy and momentum transfer of individual photons.
b) Calculate the numerical momentum value for a photon with wavelength 450 nm.

Express the final answer for part (b) in kilogram-meters per second (kg·m/s). Provide only the numerical value in scientific notation with three significant digits.

## Solution
**Part (a): Derivation of photon momentum expression**

1. Radiation pressure for a perfectly absorbing surface:
   
$$
   P = \frac{I}{c}
   $$

   where $P$ is pressure, $I$ is intensity, and $c$ is the speed of light.

2. Force $F$ on a surface of area $A$ is:
   
$$
   F = P \cdot A = \frac{I \cdot A}{c}
   $$


3. Intensity $I$ is power per unit area, so total power on area $A$ is:
   
$$
   \text{Power} = I \cdot A
   $$


4. Power equals energy per unit time. Let $dN/dt$ be the number of photons incident per second. Energy per photon is $E = hf$, so:
   
$$
   \text{Power} = \left( \frac{dN}{dt} \right) \cdot hf
   $$

   
$$
   I \cdot A = \left( \frac{dN}{dt} \right) \cdot hf
   $$


5. Frequency $f$ relates to wavelength $\lambda$ by:
   
$$
   c = f \lambda \implies f = \frac{c}{\lambda}
   $$

   Substitute:
   
$$
   I \cdot A = \left( \frac{dN}{dt} \right) \cdot h \cdot \frac{c}{\lambda}
   $$


6. Solve for photon arrival rate:
   
$$
   \frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{I \cdot A \cdot \lambda}{h c}
   $$


7. For absorption, each photon transfers momentum $p$ to the surface. Force equals momentum transfer rate:
   
$$
   F = \left( \frac{dN}{dt} \right) \cdot p = \frac{I \cdot A \cdot \lambda}{h c} \cdot p
   $$


8. Equate force expressions from steps 2 and 7:
   
$$
   \frac{I \cdot A}{c} = \frac{I \cdot A \cdot \lambda}{h c} \cdot p
   $$


9. Cancel common terms ($I$, $A$, $c$) assuming non-zero values:
   
$$
   \frac{1}{c} = \frac{\lambda p}{h c}
   $$

   
$$
   1 = \frac{\lambda p}{h}
   $$


10. Solve for photon momentum $p$:
    
$$
    p = \frac{h}{\lambda}
    $$


**Part (b): Numerical calculation**

Given:
- $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}  \text{J·s}$
- $\lambda = 450 \times 10^{-9}  \text{m} = 4.50 \times 10^{-7}  \text{m}$

Momentum:

$$
p = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4.50 \times 10^{-7}}
$$


Calculate:

$$
p = \frac{6.626}{4.50} \times 10^{-34 - (-7)} = 1.4724... \times 10^{-27}
$$


Round to three significant digits:

$$
p = 1.47 \times 10^{-27}
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{1.47 \times 10^{-27}}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**

In quantum mechanics, light exhibits particle-like behavior through photons. Each photon carries energy $E$ and momentum $p$, with the momentum given by $p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $\lambda$ is the photon's wavelength. When an atom absorbs a photon, the photon's momentum is transferred to the atom. For an atom initially at rest, this causes it to recoil, obeying the law of conservation of momentum. 

The hydrogen atom is the simplest atom, with a mass $m_h$ approximately equal to the proton mass (since the electron mass is negligible in comparison). This problem explores the recoil dynamics when a hydrogen atom absorbs an ultraviolet photon.

**Knowledge Points Tested**
1. Photon momentum: $p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$.
2. Conservation of momentum in an isolated system.
3. Algebraic manipulation to solve for recoil speed.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
- Connects quantum mechanics (photon properties) to classical mechanics (momentum conservation).
- Relates to atomic physics (absorption processes) and kinematics (recoil motion).

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
- Chemistry: Photon absorption is fundamental in spectroscopy and photochemistry.
- Astronomy: Recoil effects influence atomic behavior in stellar environments and interstellar medium.

**Real-World Applications**
- Laser cooling techniques (e.g., optical molasses) exploit photon recoil to slow atoms for quantum computing and precision measurements.
- Ultraviolet photon absorption drives processes in atmospheric science and UV radiation shielding.

**Problem Statement**
A hydrogen atom of mass $m_h$ is initially at rest. It absorbs a photon of wavelength $\lambda$. Derive an expression for the recoil speed $v$ of the hydrogen atom. Express $v$ symbolically in terms of $\lambda$, $m_h$, and $h$ (Planck's constant). Ensure your final expression is simplified to a single fraction.

**Final Answer Format**
- Provide the recoil speed $v$ as a single fraction using $\frac{h}{\lambda m_h}$.
- Do not include units or numerical substitutions.
- Use standard notation: $\lambda$ for wavelength, $h$ for Planck's constant, and $m_h$ for the hydrogen atom mass.

## Solution
**Step 1: State the conservation of momentum.**  
The atom is initially at rest, so the total initial momentum is solely due to the photon:  
$$ p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{h}{\lambda} $$  
After absorption, the photon ceases to exist, and the atom moves with recoil speed $v$. The final momentum is:  
$$ p_{\text{final}} = m_h v $$  
By conservation of momentum:  
$$ p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}} $$  
$$ \frac{h}{\lambda} = m_h v $$  

**Step 2: Solve for the recoil speed $v$.**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $v$:  
$$ v = \frac{\frac{h}{\lambda}}{m_h} $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ v = \frac{h}{\lambda m_h} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The recoil speed of the hydrogen atom after absorbing the photon is $\frac{h}{\lambda m_h}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{h}{\lambda m_h}}$$

## Problem 2
**Background**:  
Radiation pressure is the force per unit area exerted by electromagnetic radiation on a surface. This phenomenon arises from the momentum carried by photons. When photons strike a surface, they transfer momentum to it, resulting in pressure. For a perfectly absorbing surface, all incident photons are absorbed, and their momentum is fully transferred. This principle is crucial in astrophysics (e.g., stellar dynamics) and engineering (e.g., solar sail propulsion). Solar sails harness radiation pressure for spacecraft propulsion, enabling fuel-free acceleration using sunlight.

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
- Relationship between photon energy and momentum.  
- Definition and calculation of radiation pressure.  
- Conservation of momentum applied to photon absorption.  
- Connection between intensity (power per unit area) and momentum transfer rate.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem integrates wave optics (intensity) and particle physics (photon momentum), illustrating wave-particle duality. It also applies Newton's second law to momentum transfer in electromagnetic interactions.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
- **Astronomy**: Radiation pressure influences comet tails and stellar evolution.  
- **Aerospace Engineering**: Solar sails (e.g., NASA's NanoSail-D) use radiation pressure for propulsion.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
Solar sails enable long-duration space missions by converting sunlight into thrust, as demonstrated by the LightSail 2 mission, which orbited Earth using only solar radiation pressure.  

**Problem**:  
Sunlight with an intensity $I = 1000  \text{W/m}^2$ is incident normally on a perfectly absorbing surface.  
(a) Derive an expression for the radiation pressure $P$ on the surface in terms of $I$ and the speed of light in vacuum $c$.  
(b) Calculate the numerical value of $P$ using $c = 3.00 \times 10^8  \text{m/s}$.  

**Final Answer Requirements**:  
- For part (a), express $P$ symbolically in terms of $I$ and $c$.  
- For part (b), provide the numerical value in pascals (Pa) in scientific notation with three significant digits.  
- **Only the numerical value for part (b)** should be boxed in the final answer. Do not include units.

## Solution
### Part (a): Deriving the Radiation Pressure Expression  
1. **Photon momentum**:  
   Each photon carries energy $E = h f$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency. The momentum of a photon is $p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{h f}{c}$.  

2. **Intensity and power**:  
   Intensity $I$ is power per unit area. For a surface of area $A$, the total power incident is $P_{\text{total}} = I A$.  

3. **Energy incident over time $\Delta t$**:  
   The energy delivered to the surface in time $\Delta t$ is:  
   
$$
   \Delta E = P_{\text{total}} \Delta t = I A \Delta t.
   $$
  

4. **Number of photons absorbed**:  
   Let $N$ be the number of photons absorbed in time $\Delta t$. Since each photon has energy $h f$,  
   
$$
   \Delta E = N h f \implies N = \frac{I A \Delta t}{h f}.
   $$
  

5. **Total momentum transferred**:  
   Each absorbed photon transfers momentum $p = \frac{h f}{c}$. The total momentum transferred is:  
   
$$
   \Delta p_{\text{total}} = N \cdot p = \left( \frac{I A \Delta t}{h f} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{h f}{c} \right) = \frac{I A \Delta t}{c}.
   $$
  

6. **Force on the surface**:  
   Force is the rate of change of momentum (Newton's second law):  
   
$$
   F = \frac{\Delta p_{\text{total}}}{\Delta t} = \frac{I A}{c}.
   $$
  

7. **Radiation pressure**:  
   Pressure is force per unit area:  
   
$$
   P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{I}{c}.
   $$
  
   Thus, the radiation pressure for a perfectly absorbing surface is:  
   
$$
   \boxed{P = \frac{I}{c}}
   $$
  

### Part (b): Numerical Calculation  
Given:  
- $I = 1000  \text{W/m}^2$  
- $c = 3.00 \times 10^8  \text{m/s}$  

Using the derived formula:  

$$
P = \frac{I}{c} = \frac{1000}{3.00 \times 10^8} = \frac{1000}{300000000} = 3.333\ldots \times 10^{-6}  \text{Pa}.
$$
  

Rounding to three significant digits:  

$$
P = 3.33 \times 10^{-6}  \text{Pa}.
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{3.33 \times 10^{-6}}$$

------
## Problem 3
**Background**  
Radiation pressure, the force exerted by light on a surface, is a fundamental concept in optics with applications in laser technology, solar sails for spacecraft propulsion, and optical tweezers for manipulating microscopic objects. When photons strike a mirror, they transfer momentum, leading to a measurable force. For a perfectly reflecting surface, each photon's momentum reversal doubles the momentum transfer compared to absorption. This problem explores the relationship between the power and wavelength of a laser beam and the resulting force on a mirror.

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Photon energy and momentum: $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$, $p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.  
- Force as the rate of momentum transfer: $F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$.  
- Power as energy flux: $P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}$.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects quantum physics (photon properties) and classical mechanics (force and momentum). It also reinforces conservation of momentum, a core principle in physics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Radiation pressure is crucial in aerospace engineering (solar sails), biophysics (optical tweezers), and astronomy (stellar radiation effects).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Laser-based cutting tools utilize radiation pressure for precision machining. Solar sails, like those on the LightSail spacecraft, use sunlight momentum for propulsion without fuel.  

**Problem**  
A laser emits light with a power of 5 milliwatts (mW) and a wavelength of 650 nanometers (nm). The beam is incident perpendicularly on a perfectly reflecting mirror. Derive the force exerted by the light beam on the mirror. Express your answer in newtons (N) as a numerical value.

## Solution
**Step 1: Momentum change per photon**  
For a perfectly reflecting mirror, the change in momentum per photon is twice the incident momentum. The momentum of a single photon is $p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$. Thus, the momentum change per photon is:  
$$ \Delta p_{\text{photon}} = 2p = 2 \frac{h}{\lambda} $$

**Step 2: Energy per photon**  
The energy of a single photon is given by:  
$$ E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$

**Step 3: Photon flux**  
The power $P$ is the energy delivered per unit time. The number of photons striking the mirror per second (photon flux) is:  
$$ N = \frac{P}{E_{\text{photon}}} = \frac{P}{\frac{hc}{\lambda}} = \frac{P \lambda}{hc} $$

**Step 4: Force derivation**  
Force is the rate of change of total momentum. Using the photon flux and momentum change per photon:  
$$ F = N \cdot \Delta p_{\text{photon}} = \left( \frac{P \lambda}{hc} \right) \cdot \left( 2 \frac{h}{\lambda} \right) $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ F = \frac{P \lambda}{hc} \cdot 2 \frac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{2P \lambda h}{hc \lambda} = \frac{2P}{c} $$  
The wavelength $\lambda$ and Planck's constant $h$ cancel, leaving:  
$$ F = \frac{2P}{c} $$  

**Step 5: Numerical substitution**  
Given:  
- Power $P = 5  \text{mW} = 5 \times 10^{-3}  \text{W}$  
- Speed of light $c = 3.00 \times 10^8  \text{m/s}$  
Substitute into the derived formula:  
$$ F = \frac{2 \times (5 \times 10^{-3})}{3.00 \times 10^8} = \frac{10 \times 10^{-3}}{3.00 \times 10^8} = \frac{0.01}{3.00 \times 10^8} = \frac{1}{3.00 \times 10^{10}} = 3.333 \times 10^{-11}  \text{N} $$  
The value $5  \text{mW}$ has one significant digit, so the force is rounded to one significant digit:  
$$ F = 3 \times 10^{-11}  \text{N} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{3 \times 10^{-11}}$$

# power as rate of energy transfer

## Problem 0
### Background
In a laboratory experiment, a resistor of resistance $R$ is immersed in a beaker containing a mass $m$ of water. The resistor is connected to a circuit that maintains a constant current $I$ through it. The electrical energy dissipated by the resistor is entirely converted into thermal energy, which heats the water. The **specific heat capacity of water**, denoted $c$, is defined as the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of water by one degree Celsius. Assume the beaker has negligible heat capacity and there are no heat losses to the surroundings.  

### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Power as rate of energy transfer**: Electrical power $P$ dissipated in a resistor is the rate at which electrical energy is converted to thermal energy.
2. **Ohm's law**: The relationship between current $I$, resistance $R$, and voltage $V$ ($V = IR$).
3. **Thermal energy transfer**: The heat energy $Q$ absorbed by water relates to temperature change via $Q = mc\Delta T$.
4. **Energy conservation**: Electrical work done equals thermal energy gained when losses are negligible.

### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects **electromagnetism** (Ohm's law, electrical power) to **thermodynamics** (specific heat capacity, energy conservation).
- Reinforces the concept that power ($P = dE/dt$) is a universal rate quantity applicable across physics domains.

### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Chemistry**: Calorimetry experiments use similar principles to measure specific heat capacities.
- **Engineering**: Efficiency calculations in electrical heating systems (e.g., water heaters) rely on these relationships.

### Real-World Applications
- Designing electric kettles: Engineers optimize current and resistance to achieve desired heating rates.
- Calorimetry: Scientists determine specific heat capacities of materials by measuring temperature changes due to known power inputs.

### The Problem
Derive an expression for the **rate of change of the water's temperature** with respect to time, $\frac{dT}{dt}$, in terms of $I$, $R$, $m$, and $c$.  

**Final Answer Format**:  
- Express your answer as a single fraction using $\frac{}{}$.  
- Use only the variables $I$, $R$, $m$, and $c$.  
- Do not include any numerical values or units.

## Solution
### Step 1: Express electrical power dissipated  
The power $P$ dissipated in the resistor is the rate of electrical energy conversion to heat. Using Ohm's law ($V = IR$) and the power formula ($P = VI$):  
$$ P = VI = (IR)I = I^2 R $$  

### Step 2: Relate power to thermal energy transfer rate  
Since all electrical power is converted to heat absorbed by the water:  
$$ P = \frac{dQ}{dt} $$  
where $Q$ is the heat energy transferred to the water.  

### Step 3: Express heat energy in terms of temperature  
The heat energy $Q$ required to raise the temperature of the water by $\Delta T$ is:  
$$ Q = mc \Delta T $$  
For an infinitesimal temperature change $dT$:  
$$ dQ = mc  dT $$  

### Step 4: Equate power to the rate of heat transfer  
Substitute $dQ$ from Step 3 into the power expression from Step 2:  
$$ P = \frac{dQ}{dt} = mc \frac{dT}{dt} $$  

### Step 5: Substitute the electrical power expression  
Set the expression for $P$ from Step 1 equal to the thermal power expression from Step 4:  
$$ I^2 R = mc \frac{dT}{dt} $$  

### Step 6: Solve for the rate of temperature change  
Rearrange to isolate $\frac{dT}{dt}$:  
$$ \frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{I^2 R}{mc} $$  
This gives the rate of temperature increase of the water.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{I^{2} R}{m c}}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
Water pumps are essential devices for extracting groundwater in many communities. The power required by a pump depends on the rate at which it lifts water and the depth of the well. Power is defined as the rate at which energy is transferred or work is done. In this scenario, we consider an ideal pump that overcomes gravity without losses, focusing on the fundamental relationship between mass flow, gravitational potential energy, and power.

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Power as the rate of energy transfer: $ P = \frac{dE}{dt} $, where $ E $ is energy.  
2. Gravitational potential energy: $ E = m g h $, with $ m $ as mass, $ g $ as gravitational acceleration, and $ h $ as height.  
3. Mass flow rate and its connection to power: $ P = \dot{m} g h $, where $ \dot{m} $ is the mass flow rate.  
4. Unit conversion (minutes to seconds) for consistent SI units.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem links work and energy in mechanics to the concept of power, which also appears in thermodynamics (e.g., engine efficiency) and electromagnetism (e.g., electrical power).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Calculating pump power is crucial in environmental engineering (water supply systems), agriculture (irrigation design), and energy management (assessing power consumption in infrastructure).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Pumps are used in residential water systems, agricultural irrigation, industrial cooling processes, and emergency services (e.g., firefighting). Understanding power requirements helps optimize energy use and design sustainable systems.  

**Problem Statement**  
A pump lifts water from a well of depth $ h = 15  \text{m} $. It moves a mass of water $ m = 200  \text{kg} $ every minute. The acceleration due to gravity is $ g = 10  \text{m/s}^2 $. Calculate the power output of the pump in watts. Express your answer as an exact integer.

## Solution
The power output $ P $ is the rate at which work is done to lift the water against gravity. The work done $ W $ to lift a mass $ m $ to a height $ h $ is given by the gravitational potential energy formula:  
$$ W = m g h $$  
Power is the work done per unit time:  
$$ P = \frac{W}{\Delta t} $$  
where $ \Delta t $ is the time interval for the work.  

The pump lifts $ m = 200  \text{kg} $ every minute. Convert the time interval to seconds (since SI units for power are watts, or J/s):  
1 minute = 60 seconds, so $ \Delta t = 60  \text{s} $.  

Substitute $ W = m g h $ into the power equation:  
$$ P = \frac{m g h}{\Delta t} $$  

Insert the given values:  
- $ m = 200  \text{kg} $  
- $ g = 10  \text{m/s}^2 $  
- $ h = 15  \text{m} $  
- $ \Delta t = 60  \text{s} $  

This yields:  
$$ P = \frac{200 \times 10 \times 15}{60} $$  

Simplify step by step:  
1. Numerator: $ 200 \times 10 = 2000 $  
2. $ 2000 \times 15 = 30000 $  
3. Denominator: $ 60 $  
4. $ P = \frac{30000}{60} = 500 $  

The power output is $ 500  \text{W} $, as the units are $ \frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2}{\text{s}^3} = \text{J/s} = \text{W} $.

## Answer
$$\boxed{500}$$

## Problem 2
**Background:**  
In thermal engineering, designing efficient heating systems requires calculating the power needed to raise the temperature of materials. Power, defined as the rate of energy transfer, is crucial in applications like electric kettles, industrial reactors, and climate control systems. This problem explores heating a composite system (water and its container), a common scenario where both materials absorb thermal energy.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. **Specific heat capacity**: Energy required to raise the temperature of a substance per unit mass.  
2. **Power as rate of energy transfer**: Relationship between energy, power, and time.  
3. **Composite system modeling**: Calculating total energy for multiple materials undergoing the same temperature change.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects to calorimetry (measuring heat transfer) in thermodynamics and conservation of energy.  
- Extends to thermal dynamics in systems where multiple materials interact (e.g., heat sinks, insulated containers).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**

- **Environmental Engineering**: Energy efficiency calculations reduce carbon footprints in heating processes.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- **Electric Kettles**: Power ratings are designed to heat water (and the kettle) rapidly.  
- **Industrial Reactors**: Precise power calculations ensure chemical reactions occur at optimal temperatures.  

**Problem Statement:**  
An electric heater uniformly heats water of mass $m_w$ and specific heat capacity $c_w$ inside a container of mass $m_c$ and specific heat capacity $c_c$. The system's temperature must increase by $\Delta T$ in time $t$. Derive an expression for the power $P$ the heater must deliver, assuming no heat loss. Express $P$ in terms of $m_w$, $c_w$, $m_c$, $c_c$, $\Delta T$, and $t$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Calculate total thermal energy required**  
The energy $Q_w$ to heat water is:  

$$ Q_w = m_w c_w \Delta T $$
  
The energy $Q_c$ to heat the container is:  

$$ Q_c = m_c c_c \Delta T $$
  
Total energy $Q$ is the sum:  

$$ Q = Q_w + Q_c = m_w c_w \Delta T + m_c c_c \Delta T = (m_w c_w + m_c c_c) \Delta T $$
  

**Step 2: Relate energy to power**  
Power $P$ is the rate of energy transfer. For energy $Q$ delivered uniformly in time $t$:  

$$ P = \frac{Q}{t} $$
  
Substitute $Q$ from Step 1:  

$$ P = \frac{(m_w c_w + m_c c_c) \Delta T}{t} $$
  

**Conclusion:**  
The power expression accounts for energy absorption by both water and the container. The derivation uses the definition of specific heat capacity and power.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{(m_w c_w + m_c c_c) \Delta T}{t}}$$

## Problem 3
**Background:**  
In automotive engineering, understanding the power requirements for vehicle acceleration is essential for designing efficient powertrains. When a car accelerates from rest, the engine must deliver power to overcome inertia and increase kinetic energy. The work-energy theorem states that the net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy. Power, defined as the rate of energy transfer, can be averaged over time to quantify the engine's performance during acceleration. This problem explores these principles in a real-world context of electric vehicle testing.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Work-energy theorem: Net work equals change in kinetic energy.  
2. Definition of average power: Total work divided by time interval.  
3. Kinetic energy expression: $ \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects to Newton's second law (force and acceleration) through power as $ P = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{v} $.  
- Relates to mechanical energy conservation when dissipative forces are negligible.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Engineering:** Power calculations inform electric motor sizing and battery capacity in sustainable transportation.  
- **Environmental Science:** Vehicle power efficiency correlates with energy consumption and emissions.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Performance metrics for electric vehicles (e.g., 0–60 mph acceleration).  
- Energy management in regenerative braking systems.  

**Problem Statement:**  
An electric car of mass $ m = 1200  \text{kg} $ accelerates from rest to a speed of $ v = 25  \text{m/s} $ in a time $ t = 8  \text{s} $ on a straight, level road. Neglect energy losses due to friction, air resistance, or drivetrain inefficiencies. Derive an expression for the average power delivered by the motor to the car during this acceleration, in terms of $ m $, $ v $, and $ t $. Then, compute the numerical value in watts (W) using the given parameters.  

**Final Answer Format:**  
- The final answer must be the exact numerical value of the average power in watts, without units.  
- Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply the work-energy theorem.**  
The car starts from rest, so initial kinetic energy $ K_i = 0 $.  
Final kinetic energy $ K_f = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $.  
The net work done on the car equals the change in kinetic energy:  

$$ W_{\text{net}} = K_f - K_i = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2} m v^2. $$
  

**Step 2: Relate work to average power.**  
By definition, average power $ P_{\text{avg}} $ is the total work divided by the time interval:  

$$ P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{W_{\text{net}}}{t}. $$
  
Substitute the expression for $ W_{\text{net}} $:  

$$ P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} m v^2}{t} = \frac{m v^2}{2t}. $$
  

**Step 3: Compute the numerical value.**  
Substitute $ m = 1200  \text{kg} $, $ v = 25  \text{m/s} $, and $ t = 8  \text{s} $:  

$$ P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{(1200)(25)^2}{2 \times 8} = \frac{1200 \times 625}{16}. $$
  
Simplify the numerator:  

$$ 1200 \times 625 = 750{,}000. $$
  
Divide by the denominator:  

$$ \frac{750{,}000}{16} = 46{,}875. $$
  
The exact value is 46,875 W. Rounded to the nearest whole number, it remains **46,875**.  

**Conclusion:**  
The average power delivered is $ 46{,}875  \text{W} $.

## Answer
$$\boxed{46875}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**:  
In energy management, the power rating of an electrical device is a critical specification that indicates the rate at which it consumes energy. This is especially important for designing sustainable systems, such as solar-powered setups or battery-operated devices. The relationship between energy consumption and time is governed by the fundamental principle:  
$$  
P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t},  
$$  
where $P$ is power, $\Delta E$ is energy transferred, and $\Delta t$ is the time interval. The kilowatt-hour (kWh) is a unit of energy commonly used in utility billing, while power is typically measured in watts (W) or kilowatts (kW), with $1 \text{ kW} = 1000 \text{ W}$.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. Definition of power as the time rate of energy transfer.  
2. Unit conversion between kilowatt-hours (kWh), kilowatts (kW), hours (h), and minutes (min).  
3. Algebraic manipulation of equations involving physical quantities.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This concept bridges mechanics (e.g., power in moving objects) and electromagnetism (e.g., electrical power dissipation in circuits). It also extends to thermodynamics through the conservation of energy.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
- **Environmental Science**: Calculating power requirements for renewable energy systems (e.g., solar panels).  
- **Economics**: Estimating electricity costs based on device power ratings and usage time.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
- Sizing generators for backup power during outages.  
- Determining the battery capacity needed for portable electronics.  
- Optimizing energy efficiency in household appliances.  

**Problem Statement**:  
A portable emergency generator consumes $1.2 \text{ kWh}$ of energy while running continuously for $30 \text{ min}$. Derive an expression for its average power rating $P$ in kilowatts (kW). Explicitly show all unit conversions and algebraic steps.  

**Final Answer Format**:  
Provide the numerical value of $P$ as an exact fraction or integer. Do not include units in the final boxed answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Express power in terms of energy and time**  
The average power $P$ is defined as:  
$$  
P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t},  
$$  
where $\Delta E = 1.2 \text{ kWh}$ and $\Delta t = 30 \text{ min}$.  

**Step 2: Convert time to hours**  
Since $1 \text{ h} = 60 \text{ min}$,  
$$  
\Delta t = 30 \text{ min} \times \frac{1 \text{ h}}{60 \text{ min}} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ h} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ h}.  
$$  

**Step 3: Substitute values into the power equation**  
$$  
P = \frac{1.2 \text{ kWh}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ h}} = 1.2 \text{ kWh} \times \frac{2}{1 \text{ h}}.  
$$  

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
$$  
P = 1.2 \times 2 \text{ kW} = 2.4 \text{ kW}.  
$$  
*(Note: $\text{kWh} / \text{h} = \text{kW}$, as units cancel.)*  

**Step 5: Verify the result**  
- Energy consumed: $1.2 \text{ kWh}$ over $\frac{1}{2} \text{ h}$.  
- Power: $2.4 \text{ kW}$ implies $2.4 \text{ kW} \times 0.5 \text{ h} = 1.2 \text{ kWh}$, which matches the given energy.  

The average power rating is $2.4 \text{ kW}$.

# projectile motion components and trajectories

## Problem 0
**Background**  
Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics where an object moves under the influence of gravity alone. This motion occurs in a parabolic trajectory due to the independence of horizontal and vertical components. The maximum height is a key characteristic of this trajectory, occurring when the vertical velocity component becomes zero.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Decomposition of initial velocity into horizontal ($v_x = v_0 \cos \theta$) and vertical ($v_y = v_0 \sin \theta$) components.  
2. Application of the kinematic equation $v_y^2 = v_{0y}^2 - 2gH$ to determine maximum height $H$.  
3. Trigonometric identities for common angles (e.g., $\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$).  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
- Connects to energy conservation: Maximum height can also be derived using $K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f$, where kinetic energy converts to gravitational potential energy.  
- Extends to two-dimensional kinematics, reinforcing vector decomposition and motion under constant acceleration.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Engineering**: Trajectory optimization in robotics or ballistics.  
- **Sports Science**: Analyzing the arc of a basketball shot or javelin throw to maximize performance.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Calculating peak altitude in rocket launches or fireworks displays.  
- Designing water fountains where jets reach specific aesthetic heights.  

**Problem Statement**  
A projectile is launched from ground level with an initial speed of $v_0 = 30  \text{m/s}$ at an angle $\theta = 45^\circ$ above the horizontal. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$. Derive an expression for the maximum height $H$ reached by the projectile in terms of $v_0$, $\theta$, and $g$. Then, compute the numerical value of $H$ using $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$.  

**Required Format for the Final Answer**  
- Provide the numerical value of $H$ in meters, rounded to two decimal places.  
- Omit the unit in the final answer.  
- Use $\sin$, $\cos$, and exact arithmetic where applicable.  
- Angles are in degrees; omit the degree symbol ($^\circ$).

## Solution
### Step 1: Resolve initial velocity into components  
The initial velocity $v_0$ has:  
- Vertical component: $v_{0y} = v_0 \sin \theta$  
- Horizontal component: $v_{0x} = v_0 \cos \theta$ (not needed for height calculation).  

### Step 2: Apply kinematic equation for vertical motion  
At maximum height $H$, the vertical velocity becomes zero ($v_y = 0$). Using the kinematic equation:  
$$ v_y^2 = v_{0y}^2 - 2gH $$  
Substitute $v_y = 0$ and $v_{0y} = v_0 \sin \theta$:  
$$ 0 = (v_0 \sin \theta)^2 - 2gH $$  

### Step 3: Solve for maximum height $H$  
Rearrange the equation:  
$$ 2gH = (v_0 \sin \theta)^2 $$  
$$ H = \frac{(v_0 \sin \theta)^2}{2g} $$  

### Step 4: Substitute given values  
- $v_0 = 30  \text{m/s}$  
- $\theta = 45^\circ$  
- $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$  
- $\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so $\sin^2 45^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$  

Substitute into the expression for $H$:  
$$ H = \frac{(30)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{2 \cdot 9.8} = \frac{900 \cdot 0.5}{19.6} = \frac{450}{19.6} $$  

### Step 5: Compute numerical value  
$$ H = \frac{450}{19.6} \approx 22.959183673469387  \text{m} $$  
Rounded to two decimal places:  
$$ H = 22.96  \text{m} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{22.96}$$

## Problem 1
### Background

Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics where an object moves under the influence of gravity alone, following a curved trajectory. This motion can be decomposed into independent horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal motion occurs at constant velocity due to the absence of horizontal forces (ignoring air resistance), while the vertical motion experiences constant acceleration due to gravity ($g$). This decomposition allows us to model complex trajectories using one-dimensional kinematic equations for each component separately.

#### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Kinematic Equations**: Application of constant-acceleration equations for vertical free-fall motion and constant-velocity equations for horizontal motion.
2. **Vector Components of Velocity**: Understanding that velocity is a vector quantity requiring separate analysis of its horizontal ($v_x$) and vertical ($v_y$) components.
3. **Pythagorean Theorem for Velocity Magnitude**: Combining orthogonal velocity components to find the speed (magnitude) at impact: $v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$.
4. **Time of Flight**: Determining the time to reach the ground using vertical motion equations.

#### Intradisciplinary Connections
- **Conservation of Energy**: The impact velocity can alternatively be derived using energy conservation: initial kinetic energy + initial gravitational potential energy = final kinetic energy, yielding $\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$.
- **Vector Mathematics**: Velocity components are resolved using principles of vector addition and trigonometry.

#### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Calculating impact velocities is crucial in structural safety (e.g., debris fall analysis) and ballistics.
- **Sports Science**: Modeling trajectories of balls in sports like baseball or golf to predict landing speeds.

#### Real-World Applications
- **Civil Engineering**: Assessing the impact speed of rocks falling from cliffs to design protective barriers.
- **Aerospace**: Simulating payload drops from aircraft or spacecraft re-entry trajectories.

### Problem Statement

A ball is thrown horizontally from the top of a cliff of height $h$ with an initial horizontal speed $v_0$. Derive an expression for the **magnitude of the velocity** (i.e., speed) of the ball at the instant it hits the ground. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $v_0$, $h$, and $g$ (acceleration due to gravity).  

**Final Answer Format**:  
- Provide the magnitude of the velocity as a single simplified expression.  
- Use $\sqrt{\ }$ for square roots and express exponents as $a^b$ (e.g., $v_0^2$).  
- Example of valid notation: $\sqrt{v_0^{2} + 2gh}$.  
- Do **not** substitute numerical values or evaluate trigonometric functions.

## Solution
#### Step 1: Analyze Vertical Motion
The ball falls vertically from height $h$ with initial vertical velocity $v_{y0} = 0$ and acceleration $-g$ (taking upward as positive). The time $t$ to reach the ground is found using the displacement equation:  
$$ y = y_0 + v_{y0}t + \frac{1}{2}a_yt^2 $$  
Set $y = 0$ (ground level), $y_0 = h$, $v_{y0} = 0$, $a_y = -g$:  
$$ 0 = h + 0 \cdot t + \frac{1}{2}(-g)t^2 $$  
$$ 0 = h - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$  
Solve for $t$:  
$$ \frac{1}{2}gt^2 = h $$  
$$ t^2 = \frac{2h}{g} $$  
$$ t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} \quad \text{(positive root)} $$  

#### Step 2: Find Vertical Component of Velocity at Impact
Use the velocity equation for constant acceleration:  
$$ v_y = v_{y0} + a_yt $$  
Substitute $v_{y0} = 0$, $a_y = -g$, and $t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$:  
$$ v_y = 0 + (-g) \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} $$  
$$ v_y = -g \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ v_y = -\sqrt{g^2 \cdot \frac{2h}{g}} = -\sqrt{2gh} $$  
The negative sign indicates downward direction. The speed (magnitude) contribution is $\sqrt{2gh}$.  

#### Step 3: Analyze Horizontal Motion
Horizontal velocity remains constant since $a_x = 0$:  
$$ v_x = v_0 $$  

#### Step 4: Compute Magnitude of Impact Velocity
The magnitude of velocity $v$ is the Euclidean norm of the components:  
$$ v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} $$  
Substitute $v_x = v_0$ and the magnitude of $v_y = \sqrt{2gh}$:  
$$ v = \sqrt{(v_0)^2 + \left(\sqrt{2gh}\right)^2} $$  
Simplify:  
$$ v = \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2gh} $$  

#### Verification via Energy Conservation
Initial mechanical energy:  
$$ E_i = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + mgh $$  
Final mechanical energy (at ground, $U_f = 0$):  
$$ E_f = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$  
By conservation of energy ($E_i = E_f$):  
$$ \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$  
Solve for $v$:  
$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2gh $$  
$$ v = \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2gh} $$  
Both methods yield the same result.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{v_0^{2} + 2 g h}}$$

## Problem 2
**Background**  
Projectile motion involves the movement of an object launched into the air, influenced only by gravity. The horizontal range depends on the initial speed, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration. For a given initial speed and range (less than the maximum possible), two complementary launch angles yield the same range. The time of flight varies with the launch angle, impacting real-world scenarios like sports or ballistics where minimizing air time is advantageous.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Decomposition of projectile motion into horizontal and vertical components.  
2. Derivation of the range formula from kinematic equations.  
3. Solving inverse trigonometric equations for launch angles.  
4. Relationship between launch angle and time of flight.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to kinematics (velocity components), energy conservation (trade-off between kinetic and potential energy), and optimization (minimizing time of flight). It also reinforces parametric equations and trigonometric identities.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Applications include ballistics (military science), sports physics (e.g., soccer or golf trajectories), and aerospace engineering (rocket staging). The trigonometric solutions link to geometry, while optimization relates to operations research.  

**Real-World Applications**  
In soccer, a player may choose a lower trajectory to minimize the ball's air time and evade defenders. In artillery, a lower angle reduces flight time for moving targets.  

**Problem Statement**  
A projectile is launched from ground level with initial speed $v_0 = 25  \text{m/s}$ and lands at a horizontal distance $R = 40  \text{m}$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$. Air resistance is negligible.  

1. Derive the general equation for the range $R$ in terms of $v_0$, $g$, and launch angle $\theta$.  
2. Show that two distinct launch angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ satisfy the range equation for $R < \frac{v_0^2}{g}$.  
3. Calculate both angles in degrees.  
4. To minimize the time of flight, determine which angle should be selected. Report this angle in degrees, rounded to one decimal place.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Provide the numerical value for part (4) only, rounded to one decimal place. Do not include units or the degree symbol.

## Solution
**Part 1: Range Equation Derivation**  
The horizontal motion has constant velocity:  
$$ x(t) = (v_0 \cos \theta) t $$  
The vertical motion has constant acceleration:  
$$ y(t) = (v_0 \sin \theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$  
The projectile lands when $y(t) = 0$ and $t \neq 0$:  
$$ 0 = (v_0 \sin \theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$  
$$ t \left( v_0 \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} g t \right) = 0 $$  
The time of flight is:  
$$ t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g} $$  
Substitute into the horizontal equation:  
$$ R = (v_0 \cos \theta) \left( \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g} \right) = \frac{2 v_0^2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{g} $$  
Using the identity $\sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta$:  
$$ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g} $$  

**Part 2: Existence of Two Angles**  
For a given $R$, rearrange the range equation:  
$$ \sin 2\theta = \frac{R g}{v_0^2} $$  
Let $A = \frac{R g}{v_0^2}$. Since $R < \frac{v_0^2}{g}$ (non-maximum range), $0 < A < 1$. The equation $\sin \phi = A$ (where $\phi = 2\theta$) has two solutions in $[0^\circ, 180^\circ]$:  
$$ \phi_1 = \arcsin A, \quad \phi_2 = 180^\circ - \arcsin A $$  
Thus, the launch angles are:  
$$ \theta_1 = \frac{1}{2} \arcsin \left( \frac{R g}{v_0^2} \right), \quad \theta_2 = 90^\circ - \theta_1 $$  

**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**  
Substitute $v_0 = 25  \text{m/s}$, $R = 40  \text{m}$, $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$:  
$$ A = \frac{40 \times 9.8}{25^2} = \frac{392}{625} = 0.6272 $$  
$$ \arcsin(0.6272) \approx 38.872^\circ $$  
$$ \theta_1 = \frac{38.872^\circ}{2} = 19.436^\circ \approx 19.4^\circ \quad \text{(rounded)} $$  
$$ \theta_2 = 90^\circ - 19.436^\circ = 70.564^\circ \approx 70.6^\circ \quad \text{(rounded)} $$  

**Part 4: Minimizing Time of Flight**  
Time of flight $T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g}$. For fixed $v_0$ and $g$, $T \propto \sin \theta$. Since $\theta_1 < \theta_2$ (both acute), $\sin \theta_1 < \sin \theta_2$. Thus, $\theta_1$ minimizes $T$.  
The angle is $19.4^\circ$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{19.4}$$

## Problem 3
Background:
In sports such as cliff diving or engineering applications like water jet trajectory calculations, projectiles are often launched from elevated positions at angles below the horizontal. This problem models such a scenario. A stone is launched from a tower, and we aim to determine where it lands relative to the tower base. The solution requires decomposing motion into components and solving kinematic equations.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Vector decomposition of initial velocity
- Kinematic equations for constant acceleration (gravity)
- Time of flight determination via quadratic equations
- Horizontal range calculation with initial height

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem extends basic projectile motion concepts by incorporating initial height and below-horizontal launch angles, connecting to energy conservation (potential to kinetic energy conversion) and parametric analysis of trajectories.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Mathematics: Requires solving quadratic equations (algebra) and trigonometric identities (geometry). Real-world data analysis might involve statistical variations in launch conditions.

Real-World Applications:
Used in safety calculations for ski jumps, military trajectory planning for artillery fired from ridges, and civil engineering for drainage systems with angled outlets.

Problem Statement:
A stone is launched from the top of a tower of height $h$ with initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ below the horizontal. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$ (directed downward). Derive an expression for the horizontal distance from the tower's base to the landing point. 

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $h$, $v_0$, $\theta$, and $g$. Use standard mathematical notation:  
- $\sin \theta$ for sine, $\cos \theta$ for cosine  
- $\sqrt{\ }$ for square roots  
- Fractions as $\frac{a}{b}$  
- Angle $\theta$ is in degrees, but omit the degree symbol in trig functions (e.g., $\sin 30$ not $\sin 30^\circ$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Decompose initial velocity**  
Set coordinate system: origin at tower top, $x$-horizontal (positive forward), $y$-vertical (positive upward).  
- Horizontal component: $v_{0x} = v_0 \cos \theta$  
- Vertical component: $v_{0y} = -v_0 \sin \theta$ (negative since below horizontal)  

**Step 2: Vertical motion equation**  
Acceleration $a_y = -g$. Position at time $t$:  

$$
y = v_{0y} t + \frac{1}{2} a_y t^2 = (-v_0 \sin \theta) t + \frac{1}{2} (-g) t^2
$$
  
Landing occurs when $y = -h$ (stone falls height $h$ below origin):  

$$
-h = -v_0 \sin \theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$
  
Multiply both sides by $-1$:  

$$
h = v_0 \sin \theta \cdot t + \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{2} g t^2 + v_0 \sin \theta \cdot t - h = 0
$$


**Step 3: Solve for time of flight $t$**  
Quadratic equation: $\frac{1}{2} g t^2 + (v_0 \sin \theta) t - h = 0$.  
Using quadratic formula $t = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$ with $A = \frac{1}{2}g$, $B = v_0 \sin \theta$, $C = -h$:  

$$
t = \frac{ -v_0 \sin \theta \pm \sqrt{ (v_0 \sin \theta)^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}g \cdot (-h) } }{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}g} = \frac{ -v_0 \sin \theta \pm \sqrt{ v_0^2 \sin^2 \theta + 2 g h } }{g}
$$
  
Select positive root (time > 0):  

$$
t = \frac{ -v_0 \sin \theta + \sqrt{ v_0^2 \sin^2 \theta + 2 g h } }{g}
$$
  
(Since $\sqrt{ v_0^2 \sin^2 \theta + 2 g h } > v_0 |\sin \theta|$, the "$-$" root gives $t > 0$; the "$+$" root is negative and discarded.)

**Step 4: Compute horizontal distance**  
Horizontal velocity is constant ($a_x = 0$):  

$$
x = v_{0x} t = (v_0 \cos \theta) \cdot \left( \frac{ -v_0 \sin \theta + \sqrt{ v_0^2 \sin^2 \theta + 2 g h } }{g} \right)
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
x = \frac{v_0 \cos \theta}{g} \left( \sqrt{ v_0^2 \sin^2 \theta + 2 g h } - v_0 \sin \theta \right)
$$
  
This is the horizontal distance from the launch point. Since the tower base is directly below the launch point, the distance from the base equals $x$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{ \dfrac{ v_0 \cos \theta }{g} \left( \sqrt{ v_0^{2} \sin^{2} \theta + 2 g h } - v_0 \sin \theta \right) }$$

## Problem 4
### Background
Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics where an object moves under the influence of gravity alone after being launched with an initial velocity. This problem explores the motion of two projectiles launched at different angles but with the same initial speed, focusing on their relative positions at a specific instant. The scenario demonstrates how launch angle affects time of flight and horizontal displacement, even when ranges are identical for complementary angles on level ground.

#### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Resolution of initial velocity** into horizontal and vertical components.
2. **Time of flight calculation** for projectiles landing at the same vertical level.
3. **Horizontal position** as a function of time under constant velocity.
4. **Range formula** for projectiles on level ground.
5. **Relative motion analysis** between two objects at a given time.

#### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects kinematics (constant acceleration in vertical direction, constant velocity in horizontal direction) with vector decomposition.
- Reinforces the relationship between launch angle and time of flight, and its independence from the range symmetry for complementary angles.

#### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Mathematics**: Uses trigonometric identities (e.g., $\sin(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3}/2$) and algebraic manipulation.
- **Engineering**: Applications in ballistics, trajectory optimization, and targeting systems where multiple projectiles are launched simultaneously.

#### Real-World Applications
- Military scenarios involving simultaneous artillery fire at different angles.
- Sports science analysis of objects launched at complementary angles (e.g., javelin, shot put).
- Space mission planning for payload deployment at specific relative positions.

### Problem Statement
Two projectiles are launched simultaneously from the same point at angles of $30^\circ$ and $60^\circ$ above the horizontal. Both have the same initial speed $v_0$ and land on a horizontal plane at the same level as the launch point. At the moment the projectile launched at $30^\circ$ lands, the projectile launched at $60^\circ$ is still in the air. 

**Determine the horizontal distance between the two projectiles at this exact moment.**  
Express your answer symbolically in terms of $v_0$ (initial speed) and $g$ (acceleration due to gravity). Simplify the expression completely, using fractions and radicals as needed.  

**Final Answer Format Requirements**:  
- Use `\frac{a}{b}` for fractions.  
- Use `\sqrt{a}` for square roots.  
- Do **not** substitute numerical values for constants.  
- The horizontal distance is defined as the absolute difference in their horizontal coordinates.

## Solution
### Step-by-Step Derivation

**Step 1: Time of flight for the $30^\circ$ projectile**  
The time of flight $T$ for a projectile landing at the same vertical level is:  
$$ T = \frac{2v_0 \sin\theta}{g} $$  
For $\theta = 30^\circ$:  
$$ T_{30} = \frac{2v_0 \sin(30^\circ)}{g} = \frac{2v_0 \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{g} = \frac{v_0}{g} $$  
This is when the $30^\circ$ projectile lands. At $t = T_{30} = v_0/g$, we analyze both projectiles' positions.

**Step 2: Horizontal position of the $30^\circ$ projectile at $t = T_{30}$**  
The horizontal position is the range $R_{30}$. The range formula is:  
$$ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} $$  
For $\theta = 30^\circ$:  
$$ R_{30} = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(60^\circ)}{g} = \frac{v_0^2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{g} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \, v_0^2}{2g} $$  
Thus, the $30^\circ$ projectile is at $(R_{30}, 0) = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3} \, v_0^2}{2g}, 0 \right)$.

**Step 3: Horizontal position of the $60^\circ$ projectile at $t = T_{30}$**  
The horizontal velocity component is constant:  
$$ v_{x,60} = v_0 \cos(60^\circ) = v_0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{v_0}{2} $$  
The horizontal position at time $t$ is:  
$$ x_{60}(t) = (v_0 \cos(60^\circ)) t = \frac{v_0}{2} t $$  
At $t = T_{30} = v_0/g$:  
$$ x_{60}(T_{30}) = \frac{v_0}{2} \cdot \frac{v_0}{g} = \frac{v_0^2}{2g} $$  
The projectile is still airborne, so its coordinates are $\left( \frac{v_0^2}{2g}, y \right)$ (vertical position $y$ is irrelevant for horizontal distance).

**Step 4: Horizontal distance between the projectiles**  
The horizontal distance $D$ is the absolute difference in their $x$-coordinates:  
$$ D = \left| R_{30} - x_{60}(T_{30}) \right| = \left| \frac{\sqrt{3} \, v_0^2}{2g} - \frac{v_0^2}{2g} \right| = \frac{v_0^2}{2g} \left| \sqrt{3} - 1 \right| $$  
Since $\sqrt{3} > 1$, this simplifies to:  
$$ D = \frac{v_0^2}{2g} (\sqrt{3} - 1) $$  

**Final expression**:  
The horizontal distance at the specified moment is $\dfrac{v_0^2 (\sqrt{3} - 1)}{2g}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{v_0^{2} (\sqrt{3} - 1)}{2g}}$$

# relative velocity in two dimensions

## Problem 0
Background:
Navigating across a river requires accounting for the current to reach a target point. Consider a river of width $d$ flowing uniformly at speed $v_r$ perpendicular to its banks. A boat moves with speed $v_b$ relative to the water. When the boat aims straight across the river (perpendicular to the current), the current carries it downstream. However, the time to cross the river depends only on the component of the boat's velocity perpendicular to the current.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Vector decomposition of velocity into perpendicular components.
- Independence of motion in perpendicular directions.
- Relative velocity in two dimensions.
- Time calculation for constant-velocity motion.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects to projectile motion, where horizontal and vertical motions are independent. It also reinforces vector addition and the concept of inertial reference frames.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The principles apply to aviation (correcting for crosswinds during flight), robotics (path planning in moving environments), and marine navigation (accounting for ocean currents).

Real-World Applications:
Ferry operators use these calculations to determine crossing times. Swimmers in rivers apply similar reasoning to avoid being swept downstream, and autonomous drones use it for trajectory planning in flowing water or air.

Problem:
A river of width $d$ flows with uniform speed $v_r$ parallel to its banks. A boat, with speed $v_b$ relative to the water, aims directly across the river (perpendicular to the current). Derive an expression for the time $t$ it takes the boat to reach the opposite bank. Express $t$ in terms of $d$, $v_b$, and $v_r$. Explain why $v_r$ does not appear in the final expression for $t$.

## Solution
To solve this problem, we analyze the boat's motion in two perpendicular directions:  
- **Direction 1 (y-axis):** Across the river (perpendicular to the current).  
- **Direction 2 (x-axis):** Along the river (parallel to the current).  

**Step 1: Velocity components relative to ground**  
The boat aims straight across, so its velocity relative to the water is $v_b$ in the y-direction. The river current adds $v_r$ in the x-direction. The boat's velocity components relative to the ground are:  
- $v_x = v_r$ (downstream)  
- $v_y = v_b$ (across the river)  

**Step 2: Time to cross depends only on y-motion**  
The time $t$ to cross the river is determined by the y-direction motion. The boat must travel distance $d$ in the y-direction at speed $v_y = v_b$. Thus:  

$$
t = \frac{\text{distance in y-direction}}{\text{speed in y-direction}} = \frac{d}{v_b}
$$
  

**Step 3: Justify why $v_r$ does not affect $t$**  
The current ($v_r$) acts solely in the x-direction, perpendicular to the y-direction motion. Since motions in perpendicular directions are independent:  
- The current alters the boat's downstream displacement but not its cross-river speed.  
- The time to cross depends only on the y-component of velocity ($v_b$) and the width $d$.  

**Conclusion:**  
The time to cross the river is independent of the current $v_r$ and is given by $t = \frac{d}{v_b}$.

## Answer
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{d}{v_{b}}}

## Problem 1
**Background**:  
Relative velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics that describes the velocity of one object as observed from another moving reference frame. It is essential for understanding motion in various contexts, such as navigation, collision avoidance systems, and aerospace engineering. When two objects move in perpendicular directions, their relative velocity can be determined using vector subtraction and the Pythagorean theorem.

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. Vector subtraction for relative velocity  
2. Magnitude calculation of a vector using components  
3. Orthogonal vector decomposition  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem connects to vector algebra in mathematics and extends to inertial reference frames in Newtonian mechanics. It also relates to the broader topic of motion in two dimensions, where velocity vectors are resolved into perpendicular components.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
- **Navigation Systems**: Pilots and autonomous vehicles compute relative velocities to adjust headings and avoid collisions.  
- **Sports Science**: Analysts use relative velocity to study interactions between athletes in team sports.  
- **Robotics**: Path-planning algorithms rely on relative velocity calculations to coordinate multiple robots.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
- Air traffic controllers use relative velocity to manage aircraft trajectories and maintain safe separation.  
- In maritime navigation, ships determine relative velocities to assess collision risks.  
- Autonomous drones employ these calculations for swarm coordination and obstacle avoidance.  

**Problem Statement**:  
Two cars move on a flat, horizontal plane with constant velocities. Car A travels east with speed $v_A$, and Car B travels north with speed $v_B$. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the velocity of Car A relative to Car B. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $v_A$ and $v_B$.  

**Note**:  
- The final answer must be a single symbolic expression.  
- Use standard vector notation: $\hat{i}$ for east and $\hat{j}$ for north.  
- Box your final answer as $\boxed{\text{expression}}$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define velocity vectors**  
The velocity of Car A (east direction) is $\vec{v_A} = v_A \hat{i}$.  
The velocity of Car B (north direction) is $\vec{v_B} = v_B \hat{j}$.  

**Step 2: Compute relative velocity**  
The velocity of Car A relative to Car B is:  

$$
\vec{v_{AB}} = \vec{v_A} - \vec{v_B} = v_A \hat{i} - v_B \hat{j}.
$$
  

**Step 3: Determine the magnitude**  
The magnitude of $\vec{v_{AB}}$ is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components:  

$$
|\vec{v_{AB}}| = \sqrt{(v_A)^2 + (-v_B)^2} = \sqrt{v_A^2 + v_B^2}.
$$
  
The negative sign does not affect the magnitude since $(-v_B)^2 = v_B^2$.  

**Conclusion**:  
The magnitude of the relative velocity vector is $\sqrt{v_A^2 + v_B^2}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{v_A^{2} + v_B^{2}}}$$

## Problem 2
## Background
In aviation, an airplane's motion is described relative to the air (airspeed and heading), but wind causes the actual ground path to differ. This scenario explores vector addition in two dimensions to determine the true direction of travel. 

Consider an airplane flying due east with an airspeed of $v_p$ (velocity relative to air). A wind blows toward the northeast (45° from east) with speed $v_w$. The ground velocity is the vector sum of the airplane's air velocity and the wind's velocity. 

## Knowledge Points Tested
1. Vector decomposition into components
2. Vector addition
3. Direction calculation using inverse trigonometric functions
4. Relative velocity in two dimensions

## Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to projectile motion (kinematics) where initial velocity components determine trajectory.
- Extends to circular motion analysis, as vectors are fundamental in describing centripetal acceleration.

## Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Navigation (Aviation):** Pilots adjust headings to compensate for wind drift.
- **Meteorology:** Wind vectors affect aircraft fuel efficiency and flight duration.
- **Robotics:** Path planning for drones in windy conditions uses similar vector mathematics.

## Real-World Applications
- Flight navigation: Commercial airlines use wind correction angles to maintain scheduled routes and arrival times.
- Search and rescue operations: Calculating drift due to wind/waves improves target location predictions.
- Autonomous vehicles: Compensating for external forces (e.g., crosswinds) ensures accurate trajectory control.

## Problem
An airplane flies due east with an airspeed of $v_p = 200 \text{ km/h}$. A wind blows toward the northeast with a speed of $v_w = 50 \text{ km/h}$. Derive the direction of the airplane's ground velocity as an angle $\theta$ measured from due east. Use a coordinate system where east is the positive $x$-axis and north is the positive $y$-axis. 

Express $\theta$ in degrees. Simplify all expressions symbolically before numerical evaluation. 

**Final Answer Format**  
- Provide the numerical value of $\theta$ in degrees, rounded to three significant digits.
- Use $\arctan$ for the inverse tangent function (do not use $\tan^{-1}$).
- Omit the degree symbol (°) in your answer.
- Specify the angle with respect to due east, where positive angles are north of east.

## Solution
### Step 1: Define velocity vectors
- **Airplane's air velocity ($\vec{v}_{p}$):** Due east, so components are:  
  $$v_{px} = v_p = 200 \text{ km/h}, \quad v_{py} = 0 \text{ km/h}.$$
- **Wind velocity ($\vec{v}_{w}$):** Northeast (45° from east), so components are:  
  $$v_{wx} = v_w \cos 45^\circ = v_w \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad v_{wy} = v_w \sin 45^\circ = v_w \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.$$

### Step 2: Compute ground velocity components
Ground velocity ($\vec{v}_{g}$) is the vector sum:  
$$\vec{v}_{g} = \vec{v}_{p} + \vec{v}_{w}.$$  
Thus,  
- $x$-component: $v_{gx} = v_{px} + v_{wx} = v_p + v_w \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$,  
- $y$-component: $v_{gy} = v_{py} + v_{wy} = 0 + v_w \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = v_w \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

### Step 3: Derive the direction angle $\theta$
The angle $\theta$ from due east is given by:  
$$\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{v_{gy}}{v_{gx}}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{v_w \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{v_p + v_w \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}\right).$$  
Simplify the fraction:  
$$\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{v_w \sqrt{2}/2}{v_p + v_w \sqrt{2}/2}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{v_w \sqrt{2}}{2v_p + v_w \sqrt{2}}\right).$$

### Step 4: Substitute numerical values
- $v_p = 200$ km/h,  
- $v_w = 50$ km/h.  
Insert these values:  
$$\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{50 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2 \cdot 200 + 50 \cdot \sqrt{2}}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{50\sqrt{2}}{400 + 50\sqrt{2}}\right).$$  
Factor numerator and denominator:  
$$\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{50\sqrt{2}}{50(8 + \sqrt{2})}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{8 + \sqrt{2}}\right).$$

### Step 5: Rationalize and compute
Rationalize the denominator:  
$$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{8 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{8 - \sqrt{2}}{8 - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}(8 - \sqrt{2})}{(8)^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2} = \frac{8\sqrt{2} - 2}{64 - 2} = \frac{8\sqrt{2} - 2}{62} = \frac{4\sqrt{2} - 1}{31}.$$  
Now,  
$$\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{4\sqrt{2} - 1}{31}\right).$$  
Compute the numerical value:  
- $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142$,  
- $4 \cdot 1.4142 = 5.6568$,  
- $5.6568 - 1 = 4.6568$,  
- $\frac{4.6568}{31} \approx 0.150219$.  
Thus,  
$$\theta = \arctan(0.150219) \approx 8.547^\circ.$$  
Rounded to three significant digits: $\theta \approx 8.55^\circ$.

### Conclusion
The ground velocity direction is $8.55^\circ$ north of east.

## Answer
$$\boxed{8.55}$$

## Problem 3
**Background**  
In maritime navigation, ships often travel at constant velocities, and determining the minimum distance between two moving ships is crucial for collision avoidance. This problem involves two ships, A and B, moving in a plane with constant velocities. Ship A moves due east, while ship B moves in a direction 30° north of east. The initial separation between the ships is 5 km. The velocities are given in knots, a unit commonly used in navigation, where 1 knot equals 1.852 km/h. The goal is to find the minimum distance between the ships during their motion by modeling their relative positions over time.

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Conversion of units (knots to km/h).  
2. Vector decomposition of velocity into components.  
3. Relative velocity in two dimensions.  
4. Minimization of the distance between two moving points using calculus or vector methods.  
5. Application of the distance formula in the Cartesian plane.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects kinematics in two dimensions with vector algebra. The relative velocity concept is fundamental in physics for analyzing motion in moving reference frames. The minimization of distance involves calculus (derivatives) and can also be solved using the properties of vector cross products, linking to geometry.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The scenario has applications in navigation (maritime and aeronautical), where relative motion calculations are essential for collision avoidance systems. It also relates to robotics and path planning in computer science, where minimizing distances between moving objects is critical.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Maritime Safety**: Determining closest approach distances helps prevent collisions at sea.  
- **Air Traffic Control**: Similar calculations ensure safe separation between aircraft.  
- **Robotics**: Algorithms for mobile robots use relative motion to navigate around obstacles.  

**Problem Statement**  
Ship A is initially at the origin $(0, 0)$ and ship B is initially at $(5, 0)$, where positions are in kilometers. Ship A moves due east at 20 knots, and ship B moves at 15 knots in a direction 30° north of east. (Recall that 1 knot = 1.852 km/h.) Find the minimum distance (in km) between the two ships during their motion.  
- Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.  
- Use the following in your derivation:  
  - Convert velocities to km/h.  
  - Decompose velocities into x (east) and y (north) components.  
  - Model the position vectors of both ships as functions of time $t$ (in hours).  
  - Formulate the distance between the ships as a function of $t$ and minimize it.

## Solution
**Step 1: Convert velocities to km/h**  
Given:  
- Velocity of ship A: $v_A = 20$ knots.  
- Velocity of ship B: $v_B = 15$ knots.  
- Conversion factor: $1 \text{ knot} = 1.852 \text{ km/h}$.  

Convert:  

$$
v_A = 20 \times 1.852 = 37.04 \text{ km/h (due east)}.
$$


$$
v_B = 15 \times 1.852 = 27.78 \text{ km/h (30° north of east)}.
$$


**Step 2: Decompose velocities into components**  
Define the coordinate system:  
- $x$-axis: east direction.  
- $y$-axis: north direction.  

Ship A:  
- $v_{Ax} = 37.04 \text{ km/h}$, $v_{Ay} = 0 \text{ km/h}$.  

Ship B:  
- $v_{Bx} = 27.78 \cos 30^\circ$, $v_{By} = 27.78 \sin 30^\circ$.  
- $\cos 30^\circ = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660$, $\sin 30^\circ = 1/2 = 0.5$.  
- $v_{Bx} = 27.78 \times 0.8660 = 24.060 \text{ km/h}$,  
- $v_{By} = 27.78 \times 0.5 = 13.89 \text{ km/h}$.  

**Step 3: Position vectors as functions of time**  
Let $t$ be time in hours.  

Ship A (initial position: $(0, 0)$):  

$$
\vec{r_A}(t) = (37.04t, 0).
$$


Ship B (initial position: $(5, 0)$):  

$$
\vec{r_B}(t) = (5 + 24.060t, 0 + 13.89t) = (5 + 24.060t, 13.89t).
$$


**Step 4: Displacement vector and distance between ships**  
Displacement vector from A to B:  

$$
\vec{D}(t) = \vec{r_B}(t) - \vec{r_A}(t) = (5 + 24.060t - 37.04t, 13.89t - 0) = (5 - 12.98t, 13.89t).
$$


Distance $d(t)$:  

$$
d(t) = \sqrt{(5 - 12.98t)^2 + (13.89t)^2}.
$$


Minimize $d(t)$ by minimizing $d^2(t)$ to avoid the square root:  

$$
f(t) = d^2(t) = (5 - 12.98t)^2 + (13.89t)^2.
$$


**Step 5: Minimize $f(t)$ using calculus**  
Compute the derivative $f'(t)$ and set it to zero:  

$$
f(t) = (5 - 12.98t)^2 + (13.89t)^2 = 25 - 129.8t + (12.98)^2 t^2 + (13.89)^2 t^2.
$$


$$
(12.98)^2 = 168.4804, \quad (13.89)^2 = 192.9321.
$$


$$
f(t) = 25 - 129.8t + (168.4804 + 192.9321)t^2 = 25 - 129.8t + 361.4125t^2.
$$


Now,  

$$
f'(t) = -129.8 + 2 \times 361.4125t = -129.8 + 722.825t.
$$

Set $f'(t) = 0$:  

$$
-129.8 + 722.825t = 0 \implies t = \frac{129.8}{722.825} \approx 0.1795 \text{ hours}.
$$


**Step 6: Compute minimum distance**  
Substitute $t \approx 0.1795$ into $d(t)$:  

$$
x\text{-component} = 5 - 12.98 \times 0.1795 = 5 - 2.32911 = 2.67089,
$$


$$
y\text{-component} = 13.89 \times 0.1795 = 2.493655.
$$


$$
d = \sqrt{(2.67089)^2 + (2.493655)^2} = \sqrt{7.133248 + 6.217289} = \sqrt{13.350537} \approx 3.6537 \text{ km}.
$$


Rounded to three significant figures:  

$$
d_{\min} = 3.65 \text{ km}.
$$


**Verification with vector method**  
The minimum distance can also be found using the relative velocity vector $\vec{v}_{\text{rel}} = \vec{v_B} - \vec{v_A}$ and initial displacement $\vec{d_0} = (5, 0)$:  

$$
\vec{v}_{\text{rel}} = (24.060 - 37.04, 13.89 - 0) = (-12.98, 13.89) \text{ km/h}.
$$


$$
d_{\min} = \frac{|\vec{d_0} \times \vec{v}_{\text{rel}}|}{|\vec{v}_{\text{rel}}|},
$$

where the cross product magnitude in 2D is $|d_{0x} v_{\text{rel},y} - d_{0y} v_{\text{rel},x}|$:  

$$
|\vec{d_0} \times \vec{v}_{\text{rel}}| = |5 \times 13.89 - 0 \times (-12.98)| = |69.45| = 69.45,
$$


$$
|\vec{v}_{\text{rel}}| = \sqrt{(-12.98)^2 + (13.89)^2} = \sqrt{168.4804 + 192.9321} = \sqrt{361.4125} \approx 19.01085.
$$


$$
d_{\min} = \frac{69.45}{19.01085} \approx 3.652 \text{ km},
$$

which rounds to 3.65 km, confirming the result.

## Answer
$$\boxed{3.65}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**

Rivers exhibit currents that affect navigation. When crossing a river, a swimmer must account for the current to reach a desired point. This problem involves vector addition in two dimensions to counteract the river's flow. The swimmer's velocity relative to the water combines with the river's velocity to produce a resultant path. To move directly north, the swimmer must aim at a specific angle upstream to cancel the westward drift.

**Knowledge Points Tested**
- Vector decomposition and addition in two dimensions.
- Relative velocity principles.
- Inverse trigonometric functions for angle determination.
- Independence of perpendicular motion components.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
This problem extends the concept of vector resolution from one-dimensional motion to two dimensions, reinforcing how perpendicular velocity components add independently. It also connects to projectile motion, where horizontal and vertical motions are analyzed separately.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
Relative velocity is essential in aviation (correcting for wind drift), marine navigation (accounting for ocean currents), and robotics (path planning in moving environments). The trigonometric aspects link to geometry and vector mathematics.

**Real-World Applications**
- Pilots adjusting aircraft heading to compensate for crosswinds.
- Search-and-rescue operations in rivers or oceans.
- Autonomous drones navigating in windy conditions.
- Rowing competitions in tidal waters.

**Problem Statement**

A river flows due west with constant speed $v_r$. A swimmer, who moves at speed $v_s$ in still water (where $v_s > v_r$), starts from the south bank and aims to reach a point directly north on the north bank. The heading angle $\theta$ is defined as the angle east of north at which the swimmer points relative to the water.

Determine the heading angle $\theta$ required for the swimmer to achieve this path. Express $\theta$ in radians as an inverse trigonometric function of $v_r$ and $v_s$.

**Required Format for Final Answer**
- Express $\theta$ in radians using the $\arcsin$ function.
- Use the exact symbolic form in terms of $v_r$ and $v_s$.
- Do not substitute numerical values or use decimal approximations.
- Example of valid notation: $\arcsin\left(\frac{v_r}{v_s}\right)$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the coordinate system and velocity vectors.**  
Set east as the positive $x$-direction and north as the positive $y$-direction.  
- River velocity: $\vec{v}_r = (-v_r, 0)$ (westward).  
- Swimmer's velocity relative to water: $\vec{v}_s = (v_s \sin \theta, v_s \cos \theta)$ ($\theta$ is angle east of north).  

**Step 2: Compute the swimmer's ground velocity.**  
The resultant velocity $\vec{v}$ is the vector sum:  

$$
\vec{v} = \vec{v}_s + \vec{v}_r = (v_s \sin \theta - v_r, v_s \cos \theta)
$$


**Step 3: Apply the condition for direct northward motion.**  
To reach a point directly north, the east-west displacement must be zero. This requires the $x$-component of $\vec{v}$ to vanish:  

$$
v_s \sin \theta - v_r = 0
$$


**Step 4: Solve for $\theta$.**  
Rearrange the equation:  

$$
v_s \sin \theta = v_r \implies \sin \theta = \frac{v_r}{v_s}
$$
  
Take the inverse sine:  

$$
\theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{v_r}{v_s}\right)
$$
  
The condition $v_s > v_r$ ensures $\left|\frac{v_r}{v_s}\right| \leq 1$, making the arcsine defined.

**Conclusion**  
The heading angle $\theta$ that cancels the river's westward drift is $\arcsin\left(\frac{v_r}{v_s}\right)$ radians.

## Answer
$$
\boxed{\arcsin\left(\frac{v_r}{v_s}\right)}

# resistivity and temperature dependence

## Problem 0
**Background**  
In electrical circuits, the resistance of a conductor changes with temperature due to alterations in resistivity and physical dimensions. This behavior is critical in applications like temperature sensors, power transmission systems, and electronic device design. For metals, resistance typically increases with temperature, characterized by a temperature coefficient of resistance (α), defined as the relative change in resistance per degree change in temperature. When multiple conductors are combined, the total resistance depends on their individual temperature-dependent resistances and connection configuration.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Temperature dependence of resistance: $ R = R_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)] $, where $ R_0 $ is resistance at reference temperature $ T_0 $, and $ \alpha $ is the temperature coefficient.  
2. Equivalent resistance for parallel circuits: $ \frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \sum \frac{1}{R_i} $.  
3. Algebraic manipulation of multivariable expressions.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates Ohm’s law, series/parallel circuit analysis, and thermal physics. It extends to concepts like thermal expansion affecting resistance via changes in length and cross-sectional area, though here α implicitly includes these effects.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Material science (temperature-dependent properties of metals), engineering (design of thermal compensation circuits), and data analysis (modeling empirical temperature-resistance relationships).  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Thermistors**: Temperature-sensing devices using materials with high α.  
- **Power Grids**: Wires expand/contract with temperature, affecting transmission efficiency.  
- **Electronics**: Heat management in processors to prevent resistance-induced voltage drops.  

---

**Problem Statement**  
A copper wire and an aluminum wire are connected in parallel. At a reference temperature of $ T_0 = 20^\circ \text{C} $, the copper wire has a resistance of $ R_{\text{Cu,0}} = 12  \Omega $, and the aluminum wire has a resistance of $ R_{\text{Al,0}} = 8  \Omega $. The temperature coefficient of resistance for copper is $ \alpha_{\text{Cu}} = 0.004  /^\circ\text{C} $, and for aluminum, it is $ \alpha_{\text{Al}} = 0.0045  /^\circ\text{C} $, both defined at $ T_0 $.  

Derive a symbolic expression for the total resistance $ R_{\text{total}}(T) $ of the parallel combination as a function of temperature $ T $ (in $^\circ\text{C}$) relative to $ T_0 $. Use this expression to calculate the total resistance at $ T = 80^\circ \text{C} $.  

**Final Answer Format**  
- Provide the numerical value of $ R_{\text{total}} $ at $ 80^\circ \text{C} $ in ohms (Ω), rounded to six significant digits.  
- Do not include units in the answer box; only provide the number.  
- Use exact arithmetic or precise decimals without scientific notation.

## Solution
**Step 1: Express individual resistances as functions of temperature**  
The resistance of each wire at temperature $ T $ is:  
- Copper: $ R_{\text{Cu}}(T) = R_{\text{Cu,0}} \left[1 + \alpha_{\text{Cu}} (T - T_0)\right] = 12 \left[1 + 0.004 (T - 20)\right] $  
- Aluminum: $ R_{\text{Al}}(T) = R_{\text{Al,0}} \left[1 + \alpha_{\text{Al}} (T - T_0)\right] = 8 \left[1 + 0.0045 (T - 20)\right] $  

**Step 2: Derive the total resistance for the parallel combination**  
For two resistors in parallel:  

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}(T)} = \frac{1}{R_{\text{Cu}}(T)} + \frac{1}{R_{\text{Al}}(T)}
$$
  
Substitute the expressions from Step 1:  

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}(T)} = \frac{1}{12 \left[1 + 0.004 (T - 20)\right]} + \frac{1}{8 \left[1 + 0.0045 (T - 20)\right]}
$$
  
Let $ \Delta T = T - 20 $, so:  

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{12 (1 + 0.004 \Delta T)} + \frac{1}{8 (1 + 0.0045 \Delta T)}
$$
  

**Step 3: Simplify the expression**  
Find a common denominator for the right-hand side:  

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{8 (1 + 0.0045 \Delta T) + 12 (1 + 0.004 \Delta T)}{12 \cdot 8 (1 + 0.004 \Delta T)(1 + 0.0045 \Delta T)}
$$
  
Expand the numerator:  

$$
\text{Numerator} = 8 + 0.036 \Delta T + 12 + 0.048 \Delta T = 20 + 0.084 \Delta T
$$
  
The denominator is:  

$$
96 (1 + 0.004 \Delta T)(1 + 0.0045 \Delta T) = 96 \left[1 + 0.0085 \Delta T + 0.000018 (\Delta T)^2\right]
$$
  
Thus,  

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{20 + 0.084 \Delta T}{96 \left[1 + 0.0085 \Delta T + 0.000018 (\Delta T)^2\right]}
$$
  

$$
R_{\text{total}} = \frac{96 \left[1 + 0.0085 \Delta T + 0.000018 (\Delta T)^2\right]}{20 + 0.084 \Delta T}
$$
  

**Step 4: Evaluate at $ T = 80^\circ \text{C} $**  
Calculate $ \Delta T = 80 - 20 = 60 $:  
- Numerator:  
  
$$
  96 \left[1 + 0.0085 \cdot 60 + 0.000018 \cdot (60)^2\right] = 96 \left[1 + 0.51 + 0.000018 \cdot 3600\right] = 96 \left[1.51 + 0.0648\right] = 96 \cdot 1.5748 = 151.1808
  $$
  
- Denominator:  
  
$$
  20 + 0.084 \cdot 60 = 20 + 5.04 = 25.04
  $$
  
- Therefore,  
  
$$
  R_{\text{total}} = \frac{151.1808}{25.04} \approx 6.038977635...
  $$
  

**Step 5: Round to six significant digits**  
$ 6.038977635... $ rounded to six significant digits is $ 6.03898 $.  

**Conclusion**  
The total resistance at $ 80^\circ \text{C} $ is approximately $ 6.03898  \Omega $.

## Problem 1
**Background**:  
Resistivity, denoted by $\rho$, is a fundamental property of materials that quantifies their opposition to electric current. For metals, resistivity increases with temperature due to enhanced atomic vibrations that scatter electrons. This temperature dependence is modeled by the linear approximation $\rho(T) = \rho_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)]$, where $\rho_0$ is the resistivity at reference temperature $T_0$, and $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistivity. The linear model arises from the definition $\alpha = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{d\rho}{dT} \big|_{T=T_0}$, which assumes $\alpha$ is constant over a limited temperature range.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
1. Definition and interpretation of the temperature coefficient of resistivity ($\alpha$).  
2. Derivation of the linear temperature-resistivity relationship from fundamental principles.  
3. Application of the linear model to predict resistivity at arbitrary temperatures.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem connects to Ohm's law ($V = IR$), as resistivity directly influences resistance via $R = \rho L / A$. It also relates to the microscopic theory of conduction, where resistivity stems from electron scattering.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
In materials science, $\alpha$ determines component stability in circuits; in thermodynamics, it parallels thermal expansion coefficients.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
Accurate resistivity prediction is essential for designing electrical systems like heating elements (e.g., incandescent bulbs) and sensors that operate across temperature ranges.  

**Problem Statement**:  
Tungsten has a resistivity of $\rho_0 = 5.6 \times 10^{-8}  \Omega \cdot \text{m}$ at $T_0 = 20^\circ \text{C}$ and a temperature coefficient $\alpha = 0.0045  ^\circ\text{C}^{-1}$.  

1. Starting from the definition $\alpha = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{d\rho}{dT} \big|_{T=T_0}$, derive the expression for $\rho(T)$.  
2. Use this expression to calculate $\rho$ at $T = 100^\circ \text{C}$.  

**Final Answer Instructions**:  
- For part (1), express $\rho(T)$ symbolically in terms of $\rho_0$, $\alpha$, $T_0$, and $T$.  
- For part (2), provide the numerical value of $\rho$ at $100^\circ \text{C}$ in $\Omega \cdot \text{m}$. In the boxed answer, **omit units** and express the result in scientific notation rounded to three significant digits.

## Solution
**Part 1: Derivation of $\rho(T)$**  
Begin with the definition of $\alpha$:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{d\rho}{dT} \bigg|_{T=T_0}. $$  
Assume $\alpha$ is constant. Rearrange to isolate the derivative:  
$$ \frac{d\rho}{dT} = \alpha \rho_0. $$  
This is a separable differential equation. Integrate both sides from $T_0$ to $T$:  
$$ \int_{\rho_0}^{\rho} d\rho' = \alpha \rho_0 \int_{T_0}^{T} dT'. $$  
Evaluate the integrals:  
$$ \rho - \rho_0 = \alpha \rho_0 (T - T_0). $$  
Solve for $\rho$:  
$$ \rho = \rho_0 + \alpha \rho_0 (T - T_0) = \rho_0 \left[ 1 + \alpha (T - T_0) \right]. $$  
Thus, the resistivity at temperature $T$ is:  
$$ \boxed{\rho(T) = \rho_0 \left[ 1 + \alpha (T - T_0) \right]}. $$  

**Part 2: Calculation at $T = 100^\circ \text{C}$**  
Substitute the given values:  
- $\rho_0 = 5.6 \times 10^{-8}  \Omega \cdot \text{m}$,  
- $T_0 = 20^\circ \text{C}$,  
- $T = 100^\circ \text{C}$,  
- $\alpha = 0.0045  ^\circ\text{C}^{-1}$.  
Compute the temperature difference:  
$$ \Delta T = T - T_0 = 100 - 20 = 80  ^\circ\text{C}. $$  
Apply the derived formula:  
$$ \rho = (5.6 \times 10^{-8}) \left[ 1 + (0.0045)(80) \right]. $$  
Simplify the term in brackets:  
$$ 1 + (0.0045)(80) = 1 + 0.36 = 1.36. $$  
Now compute $\rho$:  
$$ \rho = (5.6 \times 10^{-8}) \times 1.36 = 7.616 \times 10^{-8}  \Omega \cdot \text{m}. $$  
Round to three significant digits:  
$$ \rho = 7.62 \times 10^{-8}  \Omega \cdot \text{m}. $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{7.62 \times 10^{-8}}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
In electrical engineering, the resistance of a metal wire changes with temperature due to atomic vibrations affecting electron flow. This behavior is characterized by the temperature coefficient of resistance, denoted by α (alpha). For many metals, resistance varies linearly with temperature over moderate ranges according to the formula:

$$ R(T) = R_0 \left[1 + \alpha (T - T_0)\right] $$

where:
- $R(T)$ is the resistance at temperature $T$ (in °C),
- $R_0$ is the resistance at reference temperature $T_0$ (in °C),
- $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistance (in °C⁻¹).

This linear approximation holds well for pure metals like iron, copper, and aluminum within typical operating ranges. The coefficient α is a material-specific property that quantifies how sensitively resistance changes per degree Celsius.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Application of the linear temperature-resistance model
- Algebraic manipulation to solve for an unknown parameter
- Interpretation of temperature-dependent resistivity

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Relates to Ohm's law and macroscopic circuit properties
- Connects to microscopic models of electron scattering in conductors
- Extends to semiconductor physics (where α is typically negative)

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Materials Science: α depends on crystal structure and purity
- Thermodynamics: Resistance changes correlate with atomic kinetic energy
- Measurement Science: Used in resistance thermometers (RTDs)

Real-World Applications:
- Temperature compensation in precision electrical instruments
- Design of heating elements and thermal sensors
- Calibration of industrial temperature probes (e.g., in blast furnaces)

Problem Statement:
An iron wire has a resistance of $R_0 = 18 \ \Omega$ at $T_0 = 0^\circ \text{C}$. When heated to $T = 100^\circ \text{C}$, its resistance becomes $R = 22.5 \ \Omega$. Using the linear temperature-resistance model, derive an expression for the temperature coefficient α and calculate its numerical value.  

Express your final answer as a decimal number (not in scientific notation) without units. Round to five decimal places if needed.

## Solution
We start with the linear temperature-resistance model:  
$$ R(T) = R_0 \left[1 + \alpha (T - T_0)\right] $$

Substitute the given values:  
$$ 22.5 = 18 \left[1 + \alpha (100 - 0)\right] $$

Divide both sides by 18 to isolate the bracketed term:  
$$ \frac{22.5}{18} = 1 + 100\alpha $$  
$$ 1.25 = 1 + 100\alpha $$

Subtract 1 from both sides:  
$$ 0.25 = 100\alpha $$

Solve for α by dividing both sides by 100:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{0.25}{100} = 0.0025 $$

Verification:  
At $T = 100^\circ \text{C}$, resistance should be:  
$ R = 18 \left[1 + 0.0025 \times 100\right] = 18 \left[1 + 0.25\right] = 18 \times 1.25 = 22.5 \ \Omega $,  
which matches the given value.

The temperature coefficient α for iron is exactly 0.0025 °C⁻¹. No rounding is needed.

## Answer
$$\boxed{0.0025}$$

## Problem 3
Background:
The resistance of a conductor changes with temperature due to variations in resistivity. For many materials, this relationship is approximately linear over a limited temperature range and can be modeled as:
$$ R = R_0 \left[1 + \alpha (T - T_0)\right] $$
where:
- $R_0$ is the resistance at reference temperature $T_0$,
- $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistivity (unit: °C⁻¹),
- $T$ is the temperature at which resistance is measured, and
- $T_0$ is the reference temperature.

Nichrome (Nickel-Chromium alloy) is widely used in heating elements due to its high resistivity and oxidation resistance. Its temperature coefficient $\alpha$ is positive, meaning resistance increases with temperature. This problem explores how temperature changes affect resistance, a key consideration in electrical engineering.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Application of the linear resistance-temperature model.
2. Algebraic manipulation to solve for an unknown temperature.
3. Interpretation of the temperature coefficient of resistivity ($\alpha$).

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Relates to Ohm's law and material properties in electromagnetism.
- Extends to thermal effects in circuits, such as power dissipation in resistors.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Electrical Engineering: Designing stable resistors for circuits operating at varying temperatures.
- Materials Science: Selecting alloys with specific $\alpha$ values for applications like thermostats or current limiters.

Real-World Applications:
- Calculating operating temperatures in heating coils (e.g., hair dryers, toasters).
- Calibrating resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) for industrial sensors.

Problem Statement:
A nichrome wire has resistance $R_0$ at $T_0 = 20^\circ \text{C}$. Its temperature coefficient of resistivity is $\alpha = 0.0004$ °C⁻¹. When the wire's resistance doubles, determine the final temperature $T$ in °C.  

Express your answer as an exact integer. Do not include the unit (°C) in your final answer.

## Solution
The resistance-temperature relationship is given by:
$$ R = R_0 \left[1 + \alpha (T - T_0)\right] $$
At temperature $T$, the resistance doubles:
$$ R = 2R_0 $$
Substitute into the equation:
$$ 2R_0 = R_0 \left[1 + \alpha (T - T_0)\right] $$
Divide both sides by $R_0$ (since $R_0 \neq 0$):
$$ 2 = 1 + \alpha (T - T_0) $$
Rearrange to isolate the temperature term:
$$ 2 - 1 = \alpha (T - T_0) $$
$$ 1 = \alpha (T - T_0) $$
Solve for $T$:
$$ T - T_0 = \frac{1}{\alpha} $$
$$ T = T_0 + \frac{1}{\alpha} $$
Substitute the given values $T_0 = 20$ and $\alpha = 0.0004$:
$$ T = 20 + \frac{1}{0.0004} $$
$$ T = 20 + 2500 $$
$$ T = 2520 $$
Thus, the final temperature is 2520°C.

## Answer
$$\boxed{2520}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**  
In electrical engineering, parallel wiring of different materials is common to balance cost and conductivity. Aluminum and copper are widely used, but their resistances change differently with temperature due to distinct temperature coefficients. This problem explores how the total resistance of a parallel aluminum-copper combination varies with temperature, illustrating the interplay between material properties and circuit behavior.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Temperature dependence of resistance: $R(T) = R_0 \left[1 + \alpha (T - T_0)\right]$, where $R_0$ is resistance at reference temperature $T_0$, and $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient.  
2. Equivalent resistance for parallel resistors: $R_{\text{eq}} = \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)^{-1}$.  
3. Algebraic manipulation of expressions involving fractional forms and substitution.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects resistivity concepts (material science) with circuit analysis (parallel networks). Understanding temperature-dependent resistance is crucial for designing electronics, power grids, and sensors that operate reliably under thermal variations.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
The temperature coefficients link to thermodynamics (kinetic energy affecting electron scattering) and materials science (atomic structure influencing $\alpha$). Applications span automotive engineering (engine wiring) and renewable energy (solar panel interconnects).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Accurate resistance calculation under temperature changes is vital for:  
- Power transmission lines (aluminum-steel cores with copper connectors).  
- Precision instruments (e.g., thermistors in climate control systems).  
- Consumer electronics (preventing overheating in parallel battery circuits).  

**Problem**  
An aluminum wire and a copper wire are connected in parallel. At $20^\circ\text{C}$, both wires have a resistance of $10  \Omega$. The temperature coefficient of resistance ($\alpha$) for aluminum is $0.0043  ^\circ\text{C}^{-1}$, and for copper, it is $0.004  ^\circ\text{C}^{-1}$. Calculate the total resistance of this parallel combination at $50^\circ\text{C}$.  

Express your final answer as a numerical value in ohms ($\Omega$), rounded to four significant digits.

## Solution
**Step 1: Recall the temperature-dependent resistance formula**  
The resistance at temperature $T$ is given by:  
$$ R(T) = R_0 \left[ 1 + \alpha (T - T_0) \right] $$  
where $R_0$ is the resistance at reference temperature $T_0$, and $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient.  

**Step 2: Define the given parameters**  
- For aluminum: $R_{0,\text{al}} = 10  \Omega$, $\alpha_{\text{al}} = 0.0043  ^\circ\text{C}^{-1}$  
- For copper: $R_{0,\text{cu}} = 10  \Omega$, $\alpha_{\text{cu}} = 0.004  ^\circ\text{C}^{-1}$  
- Reference temperature: $T_0 = 20^\circ\text{C}$  
- Target temperature: $T = 50^\circ\text{C}$  
- Temperature difference: $\Delta T = T - T_0 = 30^\circ\text{C}$  

**Step 3: Calculate individual resistances at $50^\circ\text{C}$**  
For aluminum:  
$$ R_{\text{al}} = R_{0,\text{al}} \left[ 1 + \alpha_{\text{al}} \Delta T \right] = 10 \left[ 1 + (0.0043)(30) \right] = 10 \left[ 1 + 0.129 \right] = 10 \times 1.129 = 11.29  \Omega $$  

For copper:  
$$ R_{\text{cu}} = R_{0,\text{cu}} \left[ 1 + \alpha_{\text{cu}} \Delta T \right] = 10 \left[ 1 + (0.004)(30) \right] = 10 \left[ 1 + 0.12 \right] = 10 \times 1.12 = 11.2  \Omega $$  

**Step 4: Compute the equivalent parallel resistance**  
The total resistance $R_{\text{total}}$ for two parallel resistors is:  
$$ R_{\text{total}} = \left( \frac{1}{R_{\text{al}}} + \frac{1}{R_{\text{cu}}} \right)^{-1} $$  
Substitute $R_{\text{al}} = 11.29  \Omega$ and $R_{\text{cu}} = 11.2  \Omega$:  
$$ \frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}}} = \frac{1}{11.29} + \frac{1}{11.2} $$  
Calculate each term:  
$$ \frac{1}{11.29} \approx 0.088573959, \quad \frac{1}{11.2} = \frac{5}{56} \approx 0.089285714 $$  
Sum the reciprocals:  
$$ \frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}}} = 0.088573959 + 0.089285714 = 0.177859673 $$  
Invert to find $R_{\text{total}}$:  
$$ R_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{0.177859673} \approx 5.6222  \Omega $$  

**Step 5: Round to four significant digits**  
The value $5.6222$ rounds to $5.622  \Omega$ (since the fifth digit is $2 < 5$).

## Answer
$$\boxed{5.622}$$

# rotational equilibrium conditions

## Problem 0
Background:
In engineering and physics, structures like cranes and seesaws often involve beams pivoted at one end. Understanding the forces required to maintain equilibrium is crucial for stability. Consider a uniform beam of length $ L $ and mass $ M $ pivoted at one end. A mass $ m $ is attached to the beam at a distance $ d $ from the pivot. To achieve rotational equilibrium, a horizontal force must be applied at the far end (distance $ L $ from the pivot). This scenario models real-world systems like construction cranes, where horizontal forces from cables or actuators balance loads.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Rotational equilibrium: Net torque about the pivot must be zero.
- Torque calculation: Torque = force × lever arm × sin(angle between force and lever arm).
- Center of mass: For a uniform beam, the center of mass is at $ L/2 $.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects to moment of inertia and angular acceleration in rotational dynamics. It reinforces how forces generate torque and how equilibrium conditions apply to extended objects, bridging concepts from rigid body mechanics.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
In civil engineering, this models bridge or crane design where load distribution affects stability. In biomechanics, it relates to forces on lever-like structures (e.g., bones and joints during lifting).

Real-World Applications:
- Crane operation: Calculating the horizontal force needed to stabilize a boom lifting a load.
- Seesaw design: Balancing asymmetric weights with external forces.
- Robotic arms: Determining actuator forces to hold a payload steady at a pivot.

Problem Statement:
A uniform beam of length $ L $ and mass $ M $ is pivoted at a frictionless hinge at point O. A point mass $ m $ is attached to the beam at a distance $ d $ from O. The beam is held at an angle $ \theta $ to the horizontal. A horizontal force $ F $ is applied at the far end (point A, distance $ L $ from O) to maintain equilibrium. Derive an expression for $ F $ in terms of $ M $, $ m $, $ g $, $ L $, $ d $, and $ \theta $. 

Express $ F $ using \cot \theta for cotangent. The final answer must be a simplified expression in terms of $ M $, $ m $, $ g $, $ L $, $ d $, and $ \theta $.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify forces and torques**  
The system is in rotational equilibrium, so net torque about O is zero. Forces:  
- Weight of beam: $ Mg $ downward at center of mass ($ L/2 $ from O).  
- Weight of mass $ m $: $ mg $ downward at distance $ d $ from O.  
- Applied horizontal force $ F $ at A ($ L $ from O).  
Pivot reaction forces (unneeded for torque about O).

**Step 2: Calculate torques about pivot O**  
Define counterclockwise torque as positive.  
- **Torque due to beam's weight ($ \tau_M $)**:  
  Lever arm perpendicular to $ Mg $ is $ \frac{L}{2} \cos \theta $. Force is vertical, and lever arm is horizontal.  
  $$ \tau_M = - \left( Mg \right) \cdot \left( \frac{L}{2} \cos \theta \right) $$  
  (Negative because it causes clockwise rotation).  

- **Torque due to mass $ m $ ($ \tau_m $)**:  
  Lever arm perpendicular to $ mg $ is $ d \cos \theta $.  
  $$ \tau_m = - (mg) \cdot (d \cos \theta) $$  
  (Negative for clockwise rotation).  

- **Torque due to applied force $ F $ ($ \tau_F $)**:  
  Force $ F $ is horizontal. Lever arm perpendicular to $ F $ is $ L \sin \theta $ (vertical component of position vector).  
  $$ \tau_F = + F \cdot (L \sin \theta) $$  
  (Positive because horizontal force to the left at A causes counterclockwise torque).

**Step 3: Apply rotational equilibrium condition**  
Net torque about O is zero:  
$$ \tau_M + \tau_m + \tau_F = 0 $$  
Substitute expressions:  
$$ -Mg \left( \frac{L}{2} \cos \theta \right) - mg (d \cos \theta) + F (L \sin \theta) = 0 $$  

**Step 4: Solve for $ F $**  
Isolate $ F $:  
$$ F L \sin \theta = Mg \frac{L}{2} \cos \theta + mg d \cos \theta $$  
Factor out $ \cos \theta $:  
$$ F L \sin \theta = g \cos \theta \left( \frac{M L}{2} + m d \right) $$  
Solve for $ F $:  
$$ F = \frac{g \cos \theta}{L \sin \theta} \left( \frac{M L}{2} + m d \right) $$  
Simplify using $ \cot \theta = \cos \theta / \sin \theta $:  
$$ F = \frac{g}{L} \left( \frac{M L}{2} + m d \right) \cot \theta $$  
Distribute $ g/L $:  
$$ F = g \left( \frac{M}{2} + \frac{m d}{L} \right) \cot \theta $$  

**Conclusion**  
The horizontal force $ F $ required for equilibrium is $ g \left( \frac{M}{2} + \frac{m d}{L} \right) \cot \theta $.

## Answer
$$ \boxed{ g \left( \frac{M}{2} + \frac{m d}{L} \right) \cot \theta } $$

## Problem 1
**Background:**  
Ladders are common tools, but their stability relies on fundamental physics principles. Consider a uniform ladder of mass $M$ and length $L$ leaning against a frictionless wall at an angle $\theta$ to the ground. The wall exerts no friction, so the only horizontal force at the base must counteract the ladder's tendency to slip. This scenario tests rotational and translational equilibrium, where torque and force balances determine the minimum friction coefficient needed for safety.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Rotational equilibrium (net torque = 0)  
- Translational equilibrium (net force = 0 in $x$ and $y$ directions)  
- Frictional force modeling ($f \leq \mu N$)  
- Center of mass and torque calculation  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem integrates torque (from rotational dynamics) with friction (from Newtonian mechanics), demonstrating how multiple equilibrium conditions constrain a system. It reinforces the concept that torque depends on the pivot point choice.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Engineering:** Safety analysis of structures (e.g., scaffolding, cranes) uses similar equilibrium principles.  
- **Biomechanics:** Human posture stability (e.g., leaning) involves analogous torque-friction balances.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Ladder safety standards (e.g., OSHA) prescribe angles to ensure adequate friction. Understanding the derived $\mu$ helps prevent accidents in construction and daily use.  

**Problem Statement:**  
A uniform ladder of mass $M$ and length $L$ leans against a frictionless wall, making an angle $\theta$ with the ground. Determine the minimum coefficient of static friction $\mu$ at the ground to prevent slipping.  
- **Express $\mu$ symbolically in terms of $\theta$ only.**  
- Use $\theta$ as the variable.  
- Assume gravitational acceleration $g$ acts downward.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define forces and coordinate system**  
- **Forces acting on the ladder:**  
  - Weight $Mg$ downward at the center of mass (midpoint of the ladder).  
  - Normal force $N_w$ from the wall, horizontal (since wall is frictionless).  
  - Normal force $N_g$ upward from the ground.  
  - Static friction $f$ horizontal from the ground (opposes slipping).  
- **Coordinate system:**  
  - $x$-axis horizontal (positive away from the wall).  
  - $y$-axis vertical (positive upward).  

**Step 2: Translational equilibrium conditions**  
- **Net force in $x$-direction:**  
  
$$
  f - N_w = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f = N_w \quad (1)
  $$
  
- **Net force in $y$-direction:**  
  
$$
  N_g - Mg = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad N_g = Mg \quad (2)
  $$
  

**Step 3: Rotational equilibrium (torque balance)**  
Choose the base of the ladder (point A) as the pivot to eliminate unknowns $f$ and $N_g$.  
- **Torque due to weight $Mg$:**  
  Acts at the center of mass. The perpendicular distance from A to the line of $Mg$ is $\frac{L}{2} \cos\theta$.  
  Torque direction: Clockwise → negative.  
  
$$
  \tau_{Mg} = -Mg \left(\frac{L}{2} \cos\theta\right)
  $$
  
- **Torque due to $N_w$:**  
  Acts at the top of the ladder. The perpendicular distance from A to the line of $N_w$ is $L \sin\theta$.  
  Torque direction: Counterclockwise → positive.  
  
$$
  \tau_{N_w} = N_w (L \sin\theta)
  $$
  
- **Net torque about A:**  
  
$$
  \tau_{N_w} + \tau_{Mg} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad N_w L \sin\theta - Mg \frac{L}{2} \cos\theta = 0 \quad (3)
  $$
  

**Step 4: Solve for $N_w$**  
From equation (3):  

$$
N_w L \sin\theta = Mg \frac{L}{2} \cos\theta
$$
  
Divide both sides by $L$ (assuming $L \neq 0$):  

$$
N_w \sin\theta = Mg \frac{\cos\theta}{2}
$$
  

$$
N_w = Mg \frac{\cos\theta}{2 \sin\theta} = \frac{Mg}{2} \cot\theta \quad (4)
$$
  

**Step 5: Relate friction to normal force**  
The maximum static friction at impending slip is $f = \mu N_g$. From (1) and (4):  

$$
f = N_w = \frac{Mg}{2} \cot\theta
$$
  
Substitute $N_g = Mg$ from (2):  

$$
\mu N_g = \frac{Mg}{2} \cot\theta \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mu (Mg) = \frac{Mg}{2} \cot\theta
$$
  
Divide both sides by $Mg$ (assuming $M, g \neq 0$):  

$$
\mu = \frac{1}{2} \cot\theta

## Problem 2
**Background:**  
In engineering and physics, structures like cranes, bridges, and sign supports rely on rotational equilibrium to remain stable. This problem examines a common scenario: a horizontal boom attached to a wall by a hinge, supporting a sign and stabilized by a cable. The boom has uniform density, so its weight acts at its geometric center. Static equilibrium requires that both net force and net torque are zero, preventing rotation or translation.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Conditions for static equilibrium (net torque = 0, net force = 0).  
- Torque calculation using force components and lever arms.  
- Resolution of forces into perpendicular components.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects to center of mass (uniform boom’s weight acts at midpoint).  
- Extends translational equilibrium concepts (e.g., force balances) to rotational systems.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Engineering:** Analysis of forces in trusses, bridges, and architectural supports.  
- **Mathematics:** Trigonometric decomposition and algebraic solution of equilibrium equations.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Traffic sign supports: Cables counteract torque from wind and weight.  
- Construction cranes: Booms use diagonal cables to handle heavy loads safely.  

**Problem Statement:**  
A uniform boom of mass $m$ and length $L$ is attached horizontally to a wall by a hinge at one end. The other end supports a sign of mass $M$. A cable, attached to the end of the boom and to the wall above the hinge, makes an angle $\phi$ with the horizontal boom. The system is in static equilibrium. Derive an expression for the tension $T$ in the cable. Express $T$ in terms of $m$, $M$, $g$, and $\phi$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the system and forces.**  
- The boom is horizontal, hinged at point $O$ (wall attachment).  
- Forces acting on the boom:  
  - Weight of boom: $mg$ downward at midpoint ($L/2$ from $O$).  
  - Weight of sign: $Mg$ downward at end ($L$ from $O$).  
  - Tension $T$ in the cable: acts at the end of the boom, at angle $\phi$ above horizontal.  
  - Hinge reaction force (unknown, but eliminated via torque choice).  

**Step 2: Resolve tension into components.**  
- Horizontal component: $T \cos \phi$ (toward the wall).  
- Vertical component: $T \sin \phi$ (upward).  

**Step 3: Apply torque equilibrium about hinge $O$.**  
- Net torque must be zero for static equilibrium. Choose $O$ as pivot to exclude hinge forces.  
- Torque convention: Counterclockwise positive, clockwise negative.  
- Torque due to tension: Vertical component $T \sin \phi$ acts perpendicular to boom. Lever arm = $L$.  
  
$$
  \tau_T = (T \sin \phi) \cdot L \quad (\text{counterclockwise})
  $$
  
- Torque due to boom's weight: $mg$ downward, lever arm $L/2$.  
  
$$
  \tau_m = -(mg) \cdot \frac{L}{2} \quad (\text{clockwise})
  $$
  
- Torque due to sign's weight: $Mg$ downward, lever arm $L$.  
  
$$
  \tau_M = -(Mg) \cdot L \quad (\text{clockwise})
  $$
  
- Sum torques and set to zero:  
  
$$
  \tau_T + \tau_m + \tau_M = 0
  $$
  
  
$$
  (T \sin \phi) L - (mg) \frac{L}{2} - (Mg) L = 0
  $$
  

**Step 4: Solve for tension $T$.**  
- Factor out $L$ (since $L \neq 0$):  
  
$$
  T \sin \phi - \frac{mg}{2} - Mg = 0
  $$
  
- Isolate $T$:  
  
$$
  T \sin \phi = Mg + \frac{mg}{2}
  $$
  
  
$$
  T \sin \phi = g \left( M + \frac{m}{2} \right)
  $$
  
- Solve for $T$:  
  
$$
  T = \frac{g \left( M + \frac{m}{2} \right)}{\sin \phi}
  $$
  
- Rewrite for clarity:  
  
$$
  T = \frac{g(2M + m)}{2 \sin \phi}
  $$

## Answer
$$
\boxed{\dfrac{g(2M + m)}{2 \sin \phi}}
$$

## Problem 3
Background:
In the study of rotational equilibrium, a system is balanced when the net torque acting on it is zero. This principle is fundamental in designing structures and devices that must remain stable under various forces. For a rigid body with multiple masses attached, the point of support (fulcrum) must be positioned such that the clockwise and counterclockwise torques cancel each other.

Consider a uniform meter stick of length $L$ and mass $M$. The stick has two masses attached: $m_1$ at a distance $x_1$ from the left end, and $m_2$ at a distance $x_2$ from the left end. The goal is to find the position $x$ (measured from the left end) where the fulcrum must be placed to achieve rotational equilibrium. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$, though it will cancel out in the derivation.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Torque calculation: $\tau = F \cdot d$, where $d$ is the perpendicular distance from the fulcrum to the line of force.
- Rotational equilibrium condition: $\sum \tau = 0$.
- Center of mass as the balancing point for a system under gravity.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects to linear force equilibrium (net force zero), though this problem focuses solely on rotational balance.
- Relates to the concept of moment arms in statics and the lever principle in mechanics.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Engineering: Essential in designing balanced structures like bridges and cranes.
- Biomechanics: Understanding how humans and animals maintain balance by adjusting their center of mass.

Real-World Applications:
- Seesaws and playground equipment: Adjusting the fulcrum position to balance different weights.
- Precision scales: Calibrating the pivot point for accurate mass measurements.
- Construction: Ensuring cranes and lifts remain stable when lifting asymmetric loads.

Problem:
A uniform meter stick of length $L$ and mass $M$ has two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, attached at positions $x_1$ and $x_2$ from the left end, respectively. Find the position $x$ (from the left end) where the fulcrum must be placed to achieve rotational equilibrium. Express your answer as a single fraction in terms of $m_1$, $m_2$, $M$, $x_1$, $x_2$, and $L$.

## Solution
To achieve rotational equilibrium, the net torque about the fulcrum must be zero. The forces acting downward are the weights of the masses ($m_1g$ and $m_2g$) and the weight of the stick ($Mg$), which acts at its center ($L/2$). 

Define the torque convention:  
- Torques causing counterclockwise rotation are positive.  
- Torques causing clockwise rotation are negative.  

The torque due to each component about the fulcrum at position $x$:  
1. **Torque due to $m_1$**:  
   - If $x_1 < x$, $m_1g$ causes counterclockwise torque: $\tau_1 = m_1g (x - x_1)$.  
   - If $x_1 > x$, $m_1g$ causes clockwise torque: $\tau_1 = m_1g (x_1 - x)$, which is equivalent to $m_1g (x - x_1)$ (since $x - x_1$ is negative).  
   Thus, $\tau_1 = m_1g (x - x_1)$ in all cases.  

2. **Torque due to $m_2$**:  
   Similarly, $\tau_2 = m_2g (x - x_2)$.  

3. **Torque due to the stick's weight $Mg$**:  
   The stick's center is at $L/2$, so $\tau_{\text{stick}} = Mg (x - L/2)$.  

**Net torque equation**:  

$$
\tau_1 + \tau_2 + \tau_{\text{stick}} = 0
$$
  

$$
m_1g (x - x_1) + m_2g (x - x_2) + Mg \left(x - \frac{L}{2}\right) = 0
$$
  

Divide both sides by $g$ (since $g \neq 0$):  

$$
m_1 (x - x_1) + m_2 (x - x_2) + M \left(x - \frac{L}{2}\right) = 0
$$
  

Expand the terms:  

$$
m_1x - m_1x_1 + m_2x - m_2x_2 + Mx - \frac{ML}{2} = 0
$$
  

Group $x$-terms and constants:  

$$
x(m_1 + m_2 + M) - (m_1x_1 + m_2x_2) - \frac{ML}{2} = 0
$$
  

Solve for $x$:  

$$
x(m_1 + m_2 + M) = m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + \frac{ML}{2}
$$
  

$$
x = \frac{m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + \frac{ML}{2}}{m_1 + m_2 + M}
$$
  

This is the position of the fulcrum for rotational equilibrium, equivalent to the center of mass of the entire system.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{m_{1} x_{1} + m_{2} x_{2} + \dfrac{M L}{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2} + M}}$$

## Problem 4
Background:
Doors are common examples of rotational systems. When a door is open, gravity exerts a torque that tends to rotate it closed. To hold the door stationary, a force must be applied to counteract this gravitational torque. This problem explores the relationship between the applied force and the torque about the hinge, demonstrating rotational equilibrium principles.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Rotational equilibrium: The net torque about any axis must be zero for a stationary object.
2. Torque definition: Torque ($\tau$) is the product of force and the perpendicular distance from the line of force to the pivot point ($\tau = F \cdot d_{\perp}$).
3. Center of mass: For a uniform symmetric object, the center of mass lies at its geometric center.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects to rotational dynamics by applying torque concepts to rigid bodies. It reinforces how forces generate torques and how equilibrium conditions are used to solve static systems. The solution method also draws on vector decomposition and trigonometry.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The principles are used in mechanical engineering for designing hinges and supports, in architecture for door/window systems, and in biomechanics for analyzing joint torques in the human body.

Real-World Applications:
Understanding the force required to hold a door open is essential for designing door closers, hinges, and accessibility features. Similar torque balancing applies to drawbridges, crane arms, and lever-based mechanisms.

Problem:
A uniform door of mass $M$ and width $W$ is hinged along one vertical edge. The door is held open at an angle $\theta$ relative to its closed position. A force $F$ is applied perpendicular to the door's plane at its outer edge (opposite the hinge) to maintain equilibrium. Let $\tau_h$ denote the magnitude of the gravitational torque about the hinge. Derive an expression for $F$ in terms of $\tau_h$ and $W$.

Express your answer symbolically using only the variables $\tau_h$ and $W$. Simplify the expression completely.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify forces and torques about the hinge**  
The door is in rotational equilibrium, so net torque about the hinge is zero. The relevant torques are:
- Gravitational torque ($\tau_h$): Acts downward at the center of mass (midpoint of the door, distance $W/2$ from the hinge).
- Torque due to applied force $F$: Acts at the outer edge (distance $W$ from the hinge), perpendicular to the door.

**Step 2: Equilibrium condition**  
Since the net torque must vanish:  
$$\text{Torque from } F = \tau_h$$  
The torque from $F$ is $F \cdot W$ because $F$ is perpendicular to the door, so the lever arm is the full width $W$.

**Step 3: Derive the expression**  
Equating torques:  
$$F \cdot W = \tau_h$$  
Solving for $F$:  
$$F = \frac{\tau_h}{W}$$  
This expresses $F$ solely in terms of $\tau_h$ and $W$. The derivation holds for any $\theta$ since $\tau_h$ (the gravitational torque) inherently depends on $\theta$, but $F$'s dependence is fully captured through $\tau_h$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\tau_h}{W}}$$

# rotational kinetic energy and dynamics

## Problem 0
**Background**  
Rolling without slipping is a fundamental concept in rotational dynamics, observed in everyday scenarios like a ball rolling down a ramp. This motion combines translational and rotational kinetic energy, governed by the no-slip condition $v = R\omega$, where $v$ is the linear velocity of the center of mass, $\omega$ is the angular velocity, and $R$ is the radius. For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia about its center is $I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2$, which quantifies its resistance to rotational acceleration. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy applies here since static friction (which enables rolling without slipping) does no work.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. **Conservation of mechanical energy**: Total energy (potential + kinetic) remains constant in the absence of non-conservative forces.  
2. **Rotational kinetic energy**: Expressed as $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia.  
3. **No-slip condition**: Relates linear and angular motion via $v = R\omega$.  
4. **Moment of inertia for a solid sphere**: $I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2$.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates linear kinematics (velocity, height) with rotational dynamics (angular velocity, moment of inertia) within classical mechanics. It extends the work-energy theorem to systems with both translation and rotation.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Energy conservation principles apply to thermodynamics (e.g., energy conversion in engines) and electromagnetism (e.g., conservation in LC circuits). The moment of inertia parallels the concept of mass distribution in structural engineering.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Calculating the speed of rolling objects is crucial in designing braking systems for vehicles, analyzing the motion of gears in machinery, and optimizing performance in sports equipment (e.g., bowling balls).  

---

**Problem Statement**  
A solid sphere of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is released from rest at the top of a $30^\circ$ incline with a vertical height $h$. It rolls without slipping to the bottom. Using conservation of energy, derive an expression for the linear speed $v$ of the sphere at the bottom. Express your answer in terms of $g$ (acceleration due to gravity) and $h$.  

**Final Answer Format**  
- Provide a single symbolic expression for $v$ in terms of $g$ and $h$.  
- Use $\sqrt{\ }$ for square roots and $\frac{a}{b}$ for fractions.  
- Example format: $\sqrt{\frac{gh}{k}}$ where $k$ is a constant.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define Initial and Final Energy**  
- **Initial state (top of incline)**:  
  - Gravitational potential energy: $U_i = Mgh$ (reference point: bottom).  
  - Kinetic energy: $0$ (released from rest).  
  - Total mechanical energy: $E_i = Mgh$.  
- **Final state (bottom of incline)**:  
  - Gravitational potential energy: $0$.  
  - Translational kinetic energy: $\frac{1}{2}Mv^2$.  
  - Rotational kinetic energy: $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$, where $I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2$ (moment of inertia of solid sphere).  
  - Total mechanical energy: $E_f = \frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$.  

**Step 2: Apply No-Slip Condition**  
The no-slip condition gives $\omega = \frac{v}{R}$. Substitute into rotational kinetic energy:  

$$
\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5}MR^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5}Mv^2 = \frac{1}{5}Mv^2.
$$
  

**Step 3: Write Total Final Energy**  

$$
E_f = \frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \frac{1}{5}Mv^2 = \left( \frac{5}{10} + \frac{2}{10} \right)Mv^2 = \frac{7}{10}Mv^2.
$$
  

**Step 4: Apply Conservation of Energy**  

$$
E_i = E_f \implies Mgh = \frac{7}{10}Mv^2.
$$
  
Divide both sides by $M$ (since $M \neq 0$):  

$$
gh = \frac{7}{10}v^2.
$$
  

**Step 5: Solve for $v$**  

$$
v^2 = \frac{10}{7}gh \implies v = \sqrt{\frac{10}{7}gh}.
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{10gh}{7}}}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
In rotational dynamics, the moment of inertia quantifies an object's resistance to rotational acceleration. For continuous objects, it must be derived by integrating infinitesimal mass elements. This problem explores a fundamental system: a uniform rod pivoted at one end, with potential applications in pendulum clocks, robotic arms, and biomechanics where rotational properties affect motion.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Integration techniques for continuous mass distributions
2. Linear mass density concepts
3. Moment of inertia definition and calculation
4. Rotational dynamics foundations

Intradisciplinary Connections:
Connects to torque ($\tau = I\alpha$), rotational kinetic energy ($K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$), and physical pendulums. The solution method demonstrates how continuous integrals generalize discrete summations for moment of inertia.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Engineering: Critical for designing rotating machinery and load-bearing structures. Sports science: Affects performance of implements like golf clubs or baseball bats. Astronomy: Used in calculating rotational properties of celestial bodies.

Real-World Applications:
- Clock pendulums: Period depends on moment of inertia
- Crane booms: Rotational stability during lifting operations
- Prosthetic limbs: Rotation dynamics affect mobility and energy efficiency

Problem:
A uniform rod of mass $M$ and length $L$ is pivoted about one end. Derive its moment of inertia about the pivot axis by integration. Consider a small mass element $dm$ at distance $x$ from the pivot. Set up the integral using linear mass density $\lambda$, evaluate it, and express the result in terms of $M$ and $L$.

Express your final answer as a simplified expression containing only $M$ and $L$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define linear mass density**  
Since the rod is uniform, its mass per unit length is constant:  
$$\lambda = \frac{M}{L}$$

**Step 2: Identify infinitesimal mass element**  
Consider a small segment of length $dx$ located at distance $x$ from the pivot ($0 \leq x \leq L$). Its mass is:  
$$dm = \lambda  dx = \frac{M}{L}  dx$$

**Step 3: Apply moment of inertia definition**  
The moment of inertia contribution from this element is:  
$$dI = x^2  dm = x^2 \left( \frac{M}{L}  dx \right)$$

**Step 4: Set up integral**  
Integrate along the entire rod to find total moment of inertia:  
$$I = \int dI = \int_{0}^{L} x^2 \left( \frac{M}{L} \right) dx$$

**Step 5: Evaluate integral**  
Factor out constants:  
$$I = \frac{M}{L} \int_{0}^{L} x^2  dx$$  
Compute the integral:  
$$\int_{0}^{L} x^2  dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{L} = \frac{L^3}{3} - 0 = \frac{L^3}{3}$$  
Substitute back:  
$$I = \frac{M}{L} \cdot \frac{L^3}{3} = \frac{M L^2}{3}$$

**Conclusion**  
The moment of inertia of a uniform rod about one end is $\frac{1}{3}ML^2$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3} M L^{2}}$$

## Problem 2
### Background
Pulley systems are fundamental components in mechanical engineering and physics, used in applications ranging from construction cranes to exercise equipment. This problem explores the rotational dynamics of a pulley system with two masses, highlighting the interplay between linear and rotational motion. The pulley has significant rotational inertia, making its dynamics non-trivial and requiring the application of both Newton's laws for linear motion and rotational dynamics.

#### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Newton's second law for linear motion**: The net force on an object equals its mass times acceleration ($ F_{\text{net}} = m a $).
2. **Newton's second law for rotational motion**: The net torque on a rigid body equals its moment of inertia times angular acceleration ($ \tau_{\text{net}} = I \alpha $).
3. **Constraint relations**: The linear acceleration of masses connected by a string equals the tangential acceleration of the pulley ($ a = R \alpha $).
4. **Conservation of string length**: The inextensible string ensures equal magnitudes of acceleration for both masses.

#### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem integrates concepts from linear dynamics (forces on masses) and rotational dynamics (torque on the pulley). It demonstrates how rotational inertia affects the system's acceleration, reinforcing the principle that inertia opposes changes in motion for both translation and rotation.

#### Interdisciplinary Connections
Rotational dynamics principles are crucial in mechanical engineering (e.g., gear systems), biomechanics (joint movements), and robotics (actuator design). The moment of inertia concept parallels the "inertial resistance" in electrical systems (inductance) and fluid dynamics (added mass).

#### Real-World Applications
- Elevator systems: Counterweights and pulleys reduce motor load.
- Automotive engines: Crank pulleys with rotational inertia smooth out torque fluctuations.
- Space tethers: Deployment mechanisms for satellites use pulley-like systems with rotational inertia.

### Problem Statement
Two masses, $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $, hang vertically from opposite ends of a massless string that passes over a pulley. The pulley has a moment of inertia $ I $ about its rotation axis and radius $ R $. The masses are released from rest. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $ \alpha $ of the pulley in terms of $ m_1 $, $ m_2 $, $ I $, $ R $, and gravitational acceleration $ g $.  

**Given values**:  
- $ m_1 = 2 \, \text{kg} $  
- $ m_2 = 4 \, \text{kg} $  
- $ I = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 $  
- $ R = 0.2 \, \text{m} $  
- $ g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 $  

**Required**:  
1. Symbolic expression for $ \alpha $.  
2. Numerical value of $ \alpha $ in $ \text{rad/s}^2 $.  

**Final answer format**:  
- Symbolic part: Express $ \alpha $ as $ \frac{(m_2 - m_1)gR}{I + (m_1 + m_2)R^2} $.  
- Numerical part: Provide the numerical value rounded to **two decimal places**.  
- Units: Omit units in the final answer; only provide the number.  
- Box the final numerical answer.

## Solution
### Step-by-Step Derivation

#### Step 1: Define the system and forces
Assume $ m_2 > m_1 $, so $ m_2 $ accelerates downward, and $ m_1 $ accelerates upward. The pulley rotates clockwise with angular acceleration $ \alpha $. Define:
- Linear acceleration of masses: $ a $ (magnitude same for both).
- Tensions in the string: $ T_1 $ (above $ m_1 $), $ T_2 $ (above $ m_2 $).

#### Step 2: Apply Newton's second law to each mass
- For $ m_1 $ (accelerating upward):  
  $$ T_1 - m_1 g = m_1 a \quad \text{(1)} $$
- For $ m_2 $ (accelerating downward):  
  $$ m_2 g - T_2 = m_2 a \quad \text{(2)} $$

#### Step 3: Apply Newton's second law to the pulley
Net torque on pulley: $ \tau_{\text{net}} = (T_2 - T_1) R $ (since $ T_2 $ produces clockwise torque, $ T_1 $ produces counterclockwise torque).  
Rotational law:  
$$ (T_2 - T_1) R = I \alpha \quad \text{(3)} $$

#### Step 4: Relate linear and angular acceleration
String constraint (no slipping):  
$$ a = R \alpha \quad \text{(4)} $$

#### Step 5: Solve the system of equations
Substitute (4) into (1) and (2):  
- From (1): $ T_1 = m_1 g + m_1 R \alpha $  
- From (2): $ T_2 = m_2 g - m_2 R \alpha $  

Substitute $ T_1 $ and $ T_2 $ into (3):  
$$ [(m_2 g - m_2 R \alpha) - (m_1 g + m_1 R \alpha)] R = I \alpha $$  
Simplify:  
$$ (m_2 g - m_1 g - m_2 R \alpha - m_1 R \alpha) R = I \alpha $$  
$$ (m_2 - m_1) g R - (m_1 + m_2) R^2 \alpha = I \alpha $$  

Isolate terms with $ \alpha $:  
$$ (m_2 - m_1) g R = I \alpha + (m_1 + m_2) R^2 \alpha $$  
$$ (m_2 - m_1) g R = \alpha [I + (m_1 + m_2) R^2] $$  

Solve for $ \alpha $:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{(m_2 - m_1) g R}{I + (m_1 + m_2) R^2} \quad \text{(5)} $$

#### Step 6: Numerical substitution
Given: $ m_1 = 2 $, $ m_2 = 4 $, $ I = 0.1 $, $ R = 0.2 $, $ g = 9.8 $.  
Numerator: $ (4 - 2) \times 9.8 \times 0.2 = 2 \times 9.8 \times 0.2 = 3.92 $  
Denominator: $ 0.1 + (2 + 4) \times (0.2)^2 = 0.1 + 6 \times 0.04 = 0.1 + 0.24 = 0.34 $  
$$ \alpha = \frac{3.92}{0.34} = 11.529411... \approx 11.53 \, \text{(rounded to two decimal places)} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{11.53}$$

## Problem 3
**Background:**  
Angular momentum conservation is a fundamental principle in rotational dynamics, stating that if no external torque acts on a system, its total angular momentum remains constant. This concept is crucial in analyzing systems where rotational inertia changes dynamically, such as in figure skating. When a skater pulls their arms inward, their moment of inertia decreases, leading to an increase in angular velocity to conserve angular momentum. This problem explores this phenomenon quantitatively.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. **Conservation of angular momentum**: $ L_{\text{initial}} = L_{\text{final}} $.  
2. **Definition of angular momentum**: $ L = I \omega $, where $ I $ is the moment of inertia and $ \omega $ is the angular velocity.  
3. **Algebraic manipulation** to solve for an unknown variable.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem connects to rotational kinematics (e.g., relationships between angular velocity, acceleration, and displacement) and rotational energy (e.g., $ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 $). It extends to rigid-body dynamics, where torque $ (\tau = I \alpha) $ governs rotational motion.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Engineering**: Applied in gyroscopic stabilization systems and spacecraft attitude control.  
- **Sports Science**: Explains techniques in diving, gymnastics, and skating where athletes adjust body configuration to control rotation.  
- **Astrophysics**: Describes conservation in celestial bodies (e.g., neutron star spin-up during supernova collapse).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Figure skaters use this principle to accelerate spins by reducing moment of inertia (pulling arms close). Similarly, divers tuck their bodies to increase rotation speed during flips. In technology, flywheels in energy storage systems leverage angular momentum conservation for efficient kinetic energy transfer.  

**Problem Statement:**  
A figure skater spins about a vertical axis with an initial moment of inertia $ I_i = 5  \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 $ and initial angular velocity $ \omega_i = 3  \text{rad/s} $. The skater then pulls their arms inward, reducing their moment of inertia to $ I_f = 2  \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 $. Assuming no external torques act on the system, derive an expression for the new angular velocity $ \omega_f $. Then, compute its numerical value.  

**Requirements for the Final Answer:**  
- **Symbolic derivation**: Derive $ \omega_f $ in terms of $ I_i $, $ \omega_i $, and $ I_f $.  
- **Numerical computation**: Substitute the given values to find the numerical result.  
- **Units**: Express the numerical answer as an exact number without units (implicitly in rad/s).  
- **Format**: The final answer must be a single exact numerical value.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply conservation of angular momentum.**  
Since no external torque acts on the skater, angular momentum is conserved:  
$$ L_i = L_f $$  

**Step 2: Express angular momentum in terms of $ I $ and $ \omega $.**  
The initial angular momentum is $ L_i = I_i \omega_i $.  
The final angular momentum is $ L_f = I_f \omega_f $.  
Substituting into the conservation equation:  
$$ I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f $$  

**Step 3: Solve for $ \omega_f $.**  
Isolate $ \omega_f $ by dividing both sides by $ I_f $:  
$$ \omega_f = \frac{I_i \omega_i}{I_f} $$  

**Step 4: Substitute numerical values.**  
Given $ I_i = 5  \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 $, $ \omega_i = 3  \text{rad/s} $, and $ I_f = 2  \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 $:  
$$ \omega_f = \frac{(5) \cdot (3)}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 $$  
The new angular velocity is exactly $ 7.5  \text{rad/s} $.

## Problem 4
**Background:**  
Flywheels are mechanical energy storage devices that harness rotational kinetic energy. They are crucial in applications requiring energy buffering, such as regenerative braking in electric vehicles, uninterruptible power supplies, and grid stabilization for renewable energy sources. When a constant torque is applied to a flywheel starting from rest, its angular velocity increases linearly, storing kinetic energy that depends quadratically on its rotational speed.

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Newton's second law for rotation: Relationship between torque, moment of inertia, and angular acceleration.  
2. Rotational kinematics: Angular velocity as a function of time under constant angular acceleration.  
3. Rotational kinetic energy: Expression in terms of moment of inertia and angular velocity.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects torque (dynamics) to energy storage (work-energy concepts), illustrating how forces acting over time translate to energy.  
- Reinforces analogies between linear dynamics ($F = ma$, $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$) and rotational dynamics ($\tau = I\alpha$, $K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Engineering:** Flywheel design for energy recovery systems in transportation.  
- **Environmental Science:** Role in sustainable energy management by storing excess renewable energy.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) in Formula 1 cars, where flywheels store braking energy for later acceleration.  
- Frequency regulation in power grids using flywheel farms to balance supply and demand fluctuations.  

**Problem Statement:**  
A flywheel with moment of inertia $I$ starts from rest. A constant torque $\tau$ is applied for time $t$. Derive an expression for the final rotational kinetic energy $K$ of the flywheel. Express $K$ symbolically in terms of $\tau$, $t$, and $I$.  

**Required Format for Final Answer:**  
- Provide a simplified symbolic expression.  
- Use multiplication by juxtaposition (e.g., $\tau t$ for $\tau \times t$) and explicit fractions with $\frac{}{}$.  
- Example: If the answer were $I \omega^2 / 2$, write $\frac{I\omega^{2}}{2}$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Relate torque to angular acceleration**  
Newton's second law for rotation states:  

$$
\tau = I \alpha
$$
  
where $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration. Solve for $\alpha$:  

$$
\alpha = \frac{\tau}{I}
$$


**Step 2: Determine angular velocity**  
The flywheel starts from rest ($\omega_0 = 0$). For constant angular acceleration, angular velocity $\omega$ at time $t$ is:  

$$
\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t = 0 + \left(\frac{\tau}{I}\right) t = \frac{\tau t}{I}
$$


**Step 3: Express rotational kinetic energy**  
The rotational kinetic energy $K$ is:  

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
$$
  
Substitute $\omega$ from Step 2:  

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} I \left( \frac{\tau t}{I} \right)^2
$$


**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
Expand and cancel terms:  

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} I \cdot \frac{\tau^2 t^2}{I^2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\tau^2 t^2}{I} = \frac{\tau^2 t^2}{2I}
$$
  
The final expression for rotational kinetic energy is $\frac{\tau^2 t^2}{2I}$.

## Answer
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\tau^{2} t^{2}}{2 I}}
\]

## Problem 5
**Background:**  
In many mechanical systems, such as vehicles or rolling objects on ramps, rotational motion plays a critical role in energy transformation. When a cylinder rolls without slipping, its kinetic energy includes both translational and rotational components. The moment of inertia, which depends on the object's mass distribution, determines how much energy is stored in rotation. For a solid cylinder, the moment of inertia about its central axis is derived from its geometry.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Conservation of mechanical energy (including rotational kinetic energy).  
2. Moment of inertia for a solid cylinder.  
3. Relationship between linear and angular velocity for rolling without slipping.  
4. Gravitational potential energy.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem integrates linear kinematics (incline motion), rotational dynamics (moment of inertia and angular velocity), and energy conservation—core concepts in mechanics. It extends translational kinetic energy to include rotational effects, highlighting how mass distribution affects motion.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
In engineering, this principle applies to braking systems (e.g., regenerative braking in electric vehicles, where rotational energy is converted to electrical energy). In geology, it models boulder motion on slopes.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Calculating the maximum height of a rolling cylinder simulates scenarios like runaway truck ramps (where gravel-filled inclines use rolling resistance to stop vehicles) or roller coaster design (energy conversion between kinetic and potential forms).  

**Problem:**  
A solid cylinder of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolls without slipping up an incline angled at $\theta$ to the horizontal. It starts with an initial linear speed $v_0$ at the base. Derive an expression for the maximum vertical height $h$ the cylinder reaches. Then, using $M = 4  \text{kg}$, $R = 0.5  \text{m}$, $v_0 = 6  \text{m/s}$, $\theta = 20^\circ$, and $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$, compute $h$.  

**Requirements for the final answer:**  
- Express $h$ symbolically in terms of $M$, $R$, $v_0$, $\theta$, and $g$.  
- Then, provide a numerical value in meters, rounded to three significant figures.  
- Box only the numerical value (without units) in the final answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Conservation of mechanical energy**  
Initial total energy (at base) = Final total energy (at maximum height).  
Initial energy: Kinetic energy (translational + rotational).  
Final energy: Gravitational potential energy.  

$$
\frac{1}{2} M v_0^2 + \frac{1}{2} I \omega_0^2 = M g h
$$

where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $\omega_0$ is the initial angular speed, and $h$ is the vertical height.

**Step 2: Moment of inertia for solid cylinder**  
For a solid cylinder rotating about its central axis:  

$$
I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2
$$


**Step 3: Rolling without slipping condition**  
The linear and angular speeds are related by:  

$$
\omega_0 = \frac{v_0}{R}
$$


**Step 4: Substitute into energy equation**  
Replace $I$ and $\omega_0$:  

$$
\frac{1}{2} M v_0^2 + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \left( \frac{v_0}{R} \right)^2 = M g h
$$
  
Simplify the rotational kinetic energy term:  

$$
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \cdot \frac{v_0^2}{R^2} = \frac{1}{4} M v_0^2
$$
  
Now combine with translational kinetic energy:  

$$
\frac{1}{2} M v_0^2 + \frac{1}{4} M v_0^2 = \frac{3}{4} M v_0^2
$$
  
Energy conservation equation becomes:  

$$
\frac{3}{4} M v_0^2 = M g h
$$


**Step 5: Solve for $h$**  

$$
h = \frac{3 v_0^2}{4 g}
$$
  
*Note: $h$ is independent of $M$, $R$, and $\theta$ because the rotational inertia and energy conversion depend only on $v_0$ and $g$. The incline angle $\theta$ does not affect the vertical height in conservative motion.*

**Step 6: Numerical substitution**  
Given $v_0 = 6  \text{m/s}$, $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$:  

$$
h = \frac{3 \times (6)^2}{4 \times 9.8} = \frac{3 \times 36}{39.2} = \frac{108}{39.2} \approx 2.7551  \text{m}
$$
  
Rounded to three significant figures: $2.76  \text{m}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{2.76}$$

## Problem 6
**Background**  
When objects roll down an incline without slipping, their accelerations depend on their moments of inertia due to the coupling of translational and rotational motion. A thin hoop and a solid disk (cylinder) of identical mass and radius exhibit different accelerations because their mass distributions—and thus their rotational inertias—differ. This scenario models real-world systems like vehicle wheels (disk-like) versus bicycle rims (hoop-like) on slopes, where rotational inertia affects motion control and energy efficiency.

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Rotational dynamics (torque and angular acceleration).  
2. Moment of inertia for symmetric bodies.  
3. Newton's second law for translation and rotation.  
4. Rolling without slipping constraint ($a = R\alpha$).  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem integrates linear kinematics (acceleration), rotational kinematics (angular acceleration), and energy conservation (rotational kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$ complements translational kinetic energy).

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Engineering: Moment of inertia influences the design of rolling components in machinery. Sports science: Predicts behavior of objects like rings (hoops) versus discs in athletic equipment.

**Real-World Applications**  
- Automotive safety: Tire design accounts for rotational inertia to optimize traction on inclined surfaces.  
- Physics education: Demonstrates how mass distribution affects motion in systems like yo-yos or rolling barrels.  

**Problem Statement**  
A thin hoop of mass $M$ and radius $R$ and a solid disk of mass $M$ and radius $R$ roll without slipping down the same incline, which makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. Derive the ratio of the acceleration of the hoop to the acceleration of the disk.  

Express the ratio as a simplified fraction. Do not substitute numerical values for $M$, $R$, $\theta$, or $g$ (gravitational acceleration).  

**Final Answer Format**  
Provide the ratio as a single fraction (e.g., $\frac{a}{b}$) enclosed in \boxed{}.

## Solution
**Step 1: General equation for acceleration**  
For any object rolling down an incline, apply Newton's second law:  
- Translation: $Mg \sin\theta - f = Ma$, where $f$ is friction.  
- Rotation: $\tau = I\alpha \implies f R = I \alpha$.  
Rolling without slipping requires $a = R\alpha$, so $\alpha = \frac{a}{R}$. Substitute:  

$$
f R = I \left(\frac{a}{R}\right) \implies f = \frac{I a}{R^2}.
$$
  
Substitute $f$ into the translation equation:  

$$
Mg \sin\theta - \frac{I a}{R^2} = Ma \implies Mg \sin\theta = a \left(M + \frac{I}{R^2}\right).
$$
  
Solve for acceleration:  

$$
a = \frac{Mg \sin\theta}{M + \frac{I}{R^2}} = \frac{g \sin\theta}{1 + \frac{I}{M R^2}}.
$$


**Step 2: Moment of inertia for each object**  
- **Thin hoop**: All mass is at distance $R$ from the axis, so $I_{\text{hoop}} = M R^2$.  
- **Solid disk**: Mass is distributed uniformly, so $I_{\text{disk}} = \frac{1}{2} M R^2$.  

**Step 3: Acceleration of the hoop**  
Substitute $I_{\text{hoop}} = M R^2$:  

$$
a_{\text{hoop}} = \frac{g \sin\theta}{1 + \frac{M R^2}{M R^2}} = \frac{g \sin\theta}{1 + 1} = \frac{g \sin\theta}{2}.
$$


**Step 4: Acceleration of the disk**  
Substitute $I_{\text{disk}} = \frac{1}{2} M R^2$:  

$$
a_{\text{disk}} = \frac{g \sin\theta}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{2} M R^2}{M R^2}} = \frac{g \sin\theta}{1 + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{g \sin\theta}{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{2}{3} g \sin\theta.
$$


**Step 5: Compute the ratio**  

$$
\frac{a_{\text{hoop}}}{a_{\text{disk}}} = \frac{\frac{g \sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{2}{3} g \sin\theta} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{4}.
$$
  
The gravitational acceleration $g$ and angle $\theta$ cancel out.

# second law of thermodynamics applications

## Problem 0
Background:
  The second law of thermodynamics fundamentally limits the efficiency of heat engines, which convert thermal energy into mechanical work. A heat engine operates between two thermal reservoirs: a hot reservoir at temperature $T_h$ and a cold reservoir at temperature $T_c$ (where $T_h > T_c$). The maximum possible efficiency is achieved only when the engine operates reversibly (with no net entropy production). This theoretical limit depends solely on the reservoir temperatures and provides critical insight into real-world energy conversion systems.

  Knowledge Points Tested:
    - Definition of heat engine efficiency ($\eta = W/Q_h$)
    - Entropy-based statement of the second law of thermodynamics
    - Reversibility condition for maximum efficiency
    - First law of thermodynamics for cyclic processes

  Intradisciplinary Connections:
    - Connects to thermodynamic cycles (Carnot cycle), entropy, and the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law.
    - Relates to ideal gas processes (isothermal/adiabatic expansions) that realize reversible operation.

  Interdisciplinary Connections:
    - Environmental Science: Efficiency limits impact fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions in power plants.
    - Engineering: Guides the design of steam turbines, internal combustion engines, and refrigeration systems.
    - Materials Science: High-temperature materials enable greater efficiency by allowing higher $T_h$.

  Real-World Applications:
    - Power plants (e.g., coal/nuclear) operate between $\sim$800 K (steam) and $\sim$300 K (cooling water), with maximum efficiencies of $\sim$60%. Real engines achieve $\sim$40% due to irreversibilities.
    - Automotive engines have lower maximum efficiencies ($\sim$55% for gasoline at 2500 K vs. 300 K) but highlight the importance of minimizing $T_c/T_h$.

  Problem Statement:
  Consider a reversible heat engine operating between a hot reservoir at $T_h = 400  \text{K}$ and a cold reservoir at $T_c = 300  \text{K}$. Using the second law of thermodynamics, derive an expression for the maximum efficiency $\eta_{\text{max}}$ in terms of $T_h$ and $T_c$. Then compute $\eta_{\text{max}}$ for the given temperatures.  

  Express your final answer as a decimal rounded to four decimal places. Do not include units or percentage signs.

## Solution
**Step 1: Entropy change in reservoirs**  
For a reversible engine, the total entropy change of the universe is zero over one cycle. The hot reservoir loses heat $Q_h$ at temperature $T_h$, so its entropy change is $-\frac{Q_h}{T_h}$. The cold reservoir gains heat $Q_c$ at temperature $T_c$, so its entropy change is $\frac{Q_c}{T_c}$. The engine returns to its initial state, so its entropy change is zero. Thus:  
$$ -\frac{Q_h}{T_h} + \frac{Q_c}{T_c} = 0 $$

**Step 2: Relate heat transfers**  
Rearranging the entropy equation:  
$$ \frac{Q_c}{T_c} = \frac{Q_h}{T_h} \implies \frac{Q_c}{Q_h} = \frac{T_c}{T_h} $$

**Step 3: Apply first law of thermodynamics**  
The net work done by the engine in one cycle is $W = Q_h - Q_c$ (conservation of energy). Efficiency is defined as:  
$$ \eta = \frac{W}{Q_h} = \frac{Q_h - Q_c}{Q_h} = 1 - \frac{Q_c}{Q_h} $$

**Step 4: Derive maximum efficiency**  
Substitute the ratio from Step 2:  
$$ \eta_{\text{max}} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h} $$

**Step 5: Numerical calculation**  
Substitute $T_h = 400  \text{K}$ and $T_c = 300  \text{K}$:  
$$ \eta_{\text{max}} = 1 - \frac{300}{400} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 $$  
Rounded to four decimal places:  
$$ \eta_{\text{max}} = 0.2500 $$

$$\boxed{0.2500}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
Refrigeration and heat transfer from a colder body to a hotter body are governed by the second law of thermodynamics. This law states that heat cannot spontaneously flow from cold to hot without external work. The minimum work required for such a transfer is achieved by an ideal reversible device (a Carnot refrigerator), which maximizes the coefficient of performance (COP). The COP depends on the temperatures of the reservoirs and the heat transferred.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Application of the second law of thermodynamics to heat transfer.  
- Derivation of the minimum work using the Carnot refrigerator model.  
- Relationship between work input, heat transfer, and reservoir temperatures.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects entropy change (from the second law) to work calculations in thermodynamic cycles. It extends the concept of reversible processes in heat engines to refrigeration cycles.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Engineering**: Efficiency calculations in refrigeration systems (e.g., air conditioners and heat pumps).  
- **Environmental Science**: Energy consumption analysis for sustainable cooling technologies.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Household refrigerators, industrial heat pumps, and cryogenic systems rely on this principle. For instance, transferring heat from a freezer (−20°C) to a room (25°C) requires work; minimizing this work improves energy efficiency.  

**Problem Statement**  
A reversible refrigerator (Carnot refrigerator) transfers heat $Q_c = 500  \text{J}$ from a cold reservoir at temperature $T_c = 260  \text{K}$ to a hot reservoir at temperature $T_h = 300  \text{K}$. Derive an expression for the minimum work $W_{\text{min}}$ required and compute its exact numerical value in joules.  
Express your final answer as an exact fraction. Provide only the numerical value in joules.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the coefficient of performance (COP) for a refrigerator**  
The COP for a refrigerator is the ratio of heat extracted from the cold reservoir to the work input:  
$$ \text{COP} = \frac{Q_c}{W}, $$  
where $Q_c$ is the heat transferred from the cold reservoir and $W$ is the work input.  

**Step 2: Apply the Carnot refrigerator condition**  
For a reversible refrigerator operating between two reservoirs, the COP is maximized and given by:  
$$ \text{COP}_{\text{rev}} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c}. $$  
This result is derived from the equality of entropy changes in a reversible cycle.  

**Step 3: Equate the expressions for COP**  
Set the general COP equal to the reversible COP:  
$$ \frac{Q_c}{W} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c}. $$  

**Step 4: Solve for the work $W$**  
Rearrange to isolate $W$:  
$$ W = Q_c \cdot \frac{T_h - T_c}{T_c}. $$  

**Step 5: Substitute the given values**  
Insert $Q_c = 500  \text{J}$, $T_h = 300  \text{K}$, and $T_c = 260  \text{K}$:  
$$ W_{\text{min}} = 500 \cdot \frac{300 - 260}{260} = 500 \cdot \frac{40}{260}. $$  

**Step 6: Simplify the expression**  
Reduce the fraction:  
$$ \frac{40}{260} = \frac{4}{26} = \frac{2}{13}. $$  
Thus,  
$$ W_{\text{min}} = 500 \cdot \frac{2}{13} = \frac{1000}{13}  \text{J}. $$  
This is the minimum work required, as it corresponds to a reversible process.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1000}{13}}$$

## Problem 2
Background:
A refrigerator is a device that transfers heat from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir using mechanical work. The coefficient of performance (COP) quantifies its efficiency and is defined as the ratio of heat removed from the cold reservoir to the work input. For reversible refrigerators operating on the Carnot cycle, the maximum COP is determined by the reservoir temperatures. The second law of thermodynamics imposes fundamental limits on this efficiency through entropy considerations.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Application of the first law of thermodynamics to cyclic processes (conservation of energy)
- Entropy-based constraints from the second law of thermodynamics for reversible cycles
- Temperature scale conversion (Celsius to Kelvin)
- Derivation of the Carnot refrigerator COP formula

Intradisciplinary Connections:
Connects to Carnot heat engine efficiency (reciprocal relationship), thermodynamic reversibility, and entropy conservation in ideal cycles. Reinforces the universality of the second law across different thermodynamic systems.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Engineering: Efficiency metrics for refrigeration systems in HVAC design
- Environmental Science: Energy consumption analysis for climate control systems
- Materials Science: Thermal management in electronic devices

Real-World Applications:
Household refrigerators, industrial cooling systems, and heat pumps use these principles. For example, modern refrigerators typically achieve COPs between 2 and 4, while ideal Carnot systems provide theoretical efficiency benchmarks.

Problem:
A reversible refrigerator operates on a Carnot cycle between a cold reservoir at -5°C and a hot reservoir at 25°C. Using the first and second laws of thermodynamics, derive the expression for its coefficient of performance (COP). Then calculate the numerical value of this maximum COP. 

Assume:
- $ Q_c $ = heat extracted from cold reservoir
- $ Q_h $ = heat delivered to hot reservoir
- $ W $ = work input
- $ T_c $ = cold reservoir temperature in Kelvin
- $ T_h $ = hot reservoir temperature in Kelvin

For temperature conversion, use: Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15

Format of the final answer:
Express your final numerical answer as a decimal rounded to two decimal places. Provide only the numerical value without units.

## Solution
**Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin**  
Cold reservoir: $ T_c = -5 + 273.15 = 268.15  \text{K} $  
Hot reservoir: $ T_h = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15  \text{K} $

**Step 2: Apply first law of thermodynamics**  
For a complete cycle, energy conservation gives:  
$$ Q_h = Q_c + W $$

**Step 3: Apply second law of thermodynamics**  
For a reversible (Carnot) cycle, net entropy change is zero:  
$$ \frac{Q_h}{T_h} = \frac{Q_c}{T_c} $$  
Rearrange to express $ Q_h $:  
$$ Q_h = Q_c \frac{T_h}{T_c} $$

**Step 4: Combine equations**  
Substitute the entropy relation into the energy equation:  
$$ Q_c \frac{T_h}{T_c} = Q_c + W $$  
Solve for $ W $:  
$$ W = Q_c \frac{T_h}{T_c} - Q_c = Q_c \left( \frac{T_h}{T_c} - 1 \right) = Q_c \left( \frac{T_h - T_c}{T_c} \right) $$

**Step 5: Derive COP expression**  
COP is defined as:  
$$ \text{COP} = \frac{Q_c}{W} = \frac{Q_c}{Q_c \left( \frac{T_h - T_c}{T_c} \right)} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c} $$

**Step 6: Calculate numerical value**  
Substitute temperatures:  
$$ \text{COP} = \frac{268.15}{298.15 - 268.15} = \frac{268.15}{30} = 8.938333\ldots $$  
Rounded to two decimal places: 8.94

## Answer
$$\boxed{8.94}$$

## Problem 3
**Background**  
The second law of thermodynamics governs the direction of spontaneous processes and introduces entropy as a measure of disorder. When a substance undergoes a phase change, such as freezing, the entropy change depends on the reversibility of the process. In reversible scenarios, entropy changes only in the system, but in irreversible processes (e.g., freezing in a colder environment), the total entropy of the universe (system + surroundings) increases.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Entropy change in irreversible processes  
- Heat transfer during phase transitions  
- Entropy calculations for systems and surroundings  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
Connects to heat transfer (latent heat), thermodynamic equilibrium, and the first law (energy conservation during phase changes).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Relevant to environmental science (ice formation in subzero climates) and engineering (refrigeration systems design).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Industrial freezing processes, cryopreservation of biological samples, and climate modeling of ice formation in polar regions.  

**Problem Statement**  
A mass $m$ of liquid water at its freezing point temperature $T_f$ (in K) freezes into ice in a large thermal reservoir (environment) at temperature $T_e$ (in K), where $T_e < T_f$. The latent heat of fusion (energy released during freezing) is $L_f$ per unit mass. Derive an expression for the total entropy change of the universe (system + environment) during this irreversible process.  

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $m$, $L_f$, $T_f$, and $T_e$.  

**Note**:  
- The environment acts as a heat reservoir (constant temperature $T_e$).  
- The water freezes at a constant temperature $T_f$.  
- Use standard notation: natural logarithm as $\ln$, fractions as $\frac{a}{b}$, and explicit multiplication (e.g., $m \cdot L_f$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Entropy change of the system (water)**  
The system releases heat during freezing. The heat released is $Q_{\text{system}} = m \cdot L_f$ (exothermic). Since freezing occurs at constant temperature $T_f$, the entropy change of the system is:  

$$
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = -\frac{Q_{\text{system}}}{T_f} = -\frac{m \cdot L_f}{T_f}
$$
  
The negative sign indicates a decrease in entropy due to the phase transition to a more ordered state (ice).  

**Step 2: Entropy change of the environment**  
The environment absorbs the heat released by the system: $Q_{\text{environment}} = +m \cdot L_f$. Since the environment is a reservoir at constant temperature $T_e$, its entropy change is:  

$$
\Delta S_{\text{environment}} = +\frac{Q_{\text{environment}}}{T_e} = +\frac{m \cdot L_f}{T_e}
$$
  

**Step 3: Total entropy change of the universe**  
The total entropy change is the sum of the entropy changes of the system and environment:  

$$
\Delta S_{\text{universe}} = \Delta S_{\text{system}} + \Delta S_{\text{environment}} = -\frac{m \cdot L_f}{T_f} + \frac{m \cdot L_f}{T_e}
$$
  
Factor out $m \cdot L_f$:  

$$
\Delta S_{\text{universe}} = m \cdot L_f \left( \frac{1}{T_e} - \frac{1}{T_f} \right)
$$
  

**Final expression**  
The total entropy change of the universe is:  

$$
\Delta S_{\text{universe}} = m \cdot L_f \left( \frac{1}{T_e} - \frac{1}{T_f} \right)
$$

## Answer
\[
\boxed{m \cdot L_f \left( \frac{1}{T_e} - \frac{1}{T_f} \right)}

## Problem 4
**Background:**  
The Carnot cycle is a fundamental model in thermodynamics, representing the most efficient heat engine cycle possible between two temperatures. It consists of four reversible processes: two isothermal (constant temperature) and two adiabatic (no heat transfer). The working fluid absorbs heat $Q_h$ from a hot reservoir at temperature $T_h$ and rejects heat $Q_c$ to a cold reservoir at temperature $T_c$. Entropy, a state function, quantifies disorder and is central to the second law of thermodynamics. For reversible processes, the entropy change of the universe (system + surroundings) is zero, while irreversible processes increase it.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Entropy as a state function and its change in cyclic processes.  
- Reversibility and the second law of thermodynamics.  
- Entropy transfer via heat exchange with reservoirs.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
Connects to heat engine efficiency, thermodynamic cycles, and the Clausius inequality. Reinforces that entropy change depends only on initial and final states for the system but requires path analysis for reservoirs.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Linked to statistical mechanics (entropy as microstate multiplicity) and engineering (design of efficient thermal systems like power plants).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Carnot efficiency principles guide the optimization of real engines (e.g., internal combustion engines) and refrigeration systems.  

**Problem Statement:**  
A reversible Carnot engine absorbs $Q_h = 1000  \text{J}$ of heat from a hot reservoir at $T_h = 500  \text{K}$ during its isothermal expansion phase. Determine the net entropy change of the **entire universe** (the working fluid and both reservoirs) over one complete cycle. Justify your derivation using the reversibility of the Carnot cycle. Express your answer as an exact numerical value in joules per kelvin ($\text{J/K}$).  

**Final Answer Format:**  
Provide only the numerical value (without units) in the boxed answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Analyze entropy change of the working fluid**  
The working fluid undergoes a cyclic process. Since entropy is a state function, its net change over a complete cycle is zero:  

$$
\Delta S_{\text{fluid}} = 0.
$$


**Step 2: Entropy change of the hot reservoir**  
The hot reservoir loses heat $Q_h$ at constant temperature $T_h$. Its entropy change is:  

$$
\Delta S_{\text{hot}} = -\frac{Q_h}{T_h} = -\frac{1000}{500} = -2.0  \text{J/K}.
$$


**Step 3: Entropy change of the cold reservoir**  
The cold reservoir gains heat $Q_c$ at temperature $T_c$. However, for a reversible Carnot cycle:  
- Efficiency $\eta = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h} = 1 - \frac{Q_c}{Q_h}$, so $Q_c = Q_h \left(1 - \eta\right)$.  
- Reversibility implies the entropy transfer satisfies $\frac{Q_h}{T_h} = \frac{Q_c}{T_c}$.  
Thus:  

$$
\Delta S_{\text{cold}} = \frac{Q_c}{T_c} = \frac{Q_h}{T_h} \quad (\text{from reversibility}).
$$


**Step 4: Net entropy change of the universe**  
The universe includes the fluid and both reservoirs:  

$$
\Delta S_{\text{universe}} = \Delta S_{\text{fluid}} + \Delta S_{\text{hot}} + \Delta S_{\text{cold}}.
$$
  
Substituting the expressions:  

$$
\Delta S_{\text{universe}} = 0 + \left(-\frac{Q_h}{T_h}\right) + \frac{Q_h}{T_h} = 0.
$$
  
The terms cancel, yielding zero.  

**Step 5: Justification via the second law**  
As the Carnot cycle is reversible, the net entropy change of the universe must be zero. This aligns with the second law, which states $\Delta S_{\text{universe}} = 0$ for reversible processes.  

**Conclusion:**  
The net entropy change of the universe is exactly $0  \text{J/K}$.

## Problem 5
**Background**  
A heat pump is a device that transfers thermal energy from a colder region to a hotter region using mechanical work, commonly used for heating buildings. The second law of thermodynamics dictates that a heat pump requires work input ($W$) to move heat ($Q_h$) into a warmer space (e.g., a house) from a colder environment. The minimum work input occurs when the heat pump operates reversibly (i.e., as a Carnot heat pump), maximizing the coefficient of performance (COP). The COP for a heat pump is defined as $\text{COP} = Q_h / W$. For a Carnot heat pump operating between absolute temperatures $T_c$ (cold reservoir) and $T_h$ (hot reservoir), the maximum COP is $\text{COP}_{\text{max}} = T_h / (T_h - T_c)$.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Definition and application of the coefficient of performance (COP) for heat pumps.  
- Derivation of the minimum work input using the Carnot COP limit.  
- Application of the second law of thermodynamics to reversible heat transfer processes.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to Carnot efficiency principles in thermodynamics, entropy analysis (as reversible processes imply no net entropy change), and energy conservation (first law).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Engineering (HVAC system design), environmental science (energy efficiency in heating systems), and building physics (heat transfer in structures).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Heat pumps are used in residential heating to reduce energy consumption. For example, optimizing the COP minimizes electricity costs and carbon footprints, making this principle vital for sustainable technology.  

**Problem Statement**  
A heat pump delivers heat to a house at a rate of $Q_h = 5  \text{kW}$. The house is maintained at $T_h = 295  \text{K}$, while the outside temperature is $T_c = 275  \text{K}$. Assuming the heat pump operates reversibly, derive the minimum power input $W_{\text{min}}$ (in kilowatts) required.  

Express $W_{\text{min}}$ as an exact fraction. Provide only the numerical value (without units) in your final answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: State the COP for a Carnot heat pump**  
The maximum coefficient of performance for a reversible heat pump is:  
$$
\text{COP}_{\text{max}} = \frac{T_h}{T_h - T_c}
$$  
Substituting the given temperatures:  
$$
\text{COP}_{\text{max}} = \frac{295}{295 - 275} = \frac{295}{20} = \frac{59}{4}
$$  

**Step 2: Relate COP to work input**  
The COP is defined as the ratio of heat delivered ($Q_h$) to work input ($W$):  
$$
\text{COP}_{\text{max}} = \frac{Q_h}{W_{\text{min}}}
$$  
Rearranging for $W_{\text{min}}$:  
$$
W_{\text{min}} = \frac{Q_h}{\text{COP}_{\text{max}}}
$$  

**Step 3: Substitute values and compute**  
Using $Q_h = 5  \text{kW}$ and $\text{COP}_{\text{max}} = 59/4$:  
$$
W_{\text{min}} = \frac{5}{\frac{59}{4}} = 5 \times \frac{4}{59} = \frac{20}{59}
$$  
The minimum power input is $\frac{20}{59}  \text{kW}$.  

**Step 4: Express the numerical value**  
The exact fractional value of $W_{\text{min}}$ is $\frac{20}{59}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{20}{59}}$$

# single-slit diffraction patterns

## Problem 0
Background:
In wave optics, single-slit diffraction occurs when light passes through a narrow aperture, producing a pattern of bright and dark fringes on a distant screen. The dark fringes (minima) result from destructive interference of light waves originating from different parts of the slit. The angular positions of these minima depend on the wavelength of light (λ) and the slit width (a). For the first minimum, the condition arises when the path difference between waves from opposite edges of the slit equals one wavelength, causing complete cancellation.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Huygens' principle and wavelet superposition.
2. Destructive interference condition for single-slit diffraction minima.
3. Trigonometric relationship between path difference and angular position.
4. Inverse trigonometric functions for exact angle calculation.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This topic extends wave interference principles to aperture-limited systems, contrasting with double-slit interference where coherent sources are separated. It also underpins resolution limits in optical instruments described by Rayleigh's criterion.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Diffraction principles apply to acoustics (sound wave spreading), radio wave propagation (antenna design), and quantum mechanics (wave-particle duality demonstrations).

Real-World Applications:
- Designing spectrometers to measure light wavelengths.
- Calculating resolution limits in microscopes and telescopes.
- Optimizing slit widths in industrial laser cutting systems.

Problem Statement:
Monochromatic light of wavelength $ \lambda = 500  \text{nm} $ passes through a single slit of width $ a = 0.05  \text{mm} $. Derive the exact expression for the angular position $ \theta $ (relative to the central maximum) of the first diffraction minimum. Then, compute the numerical value of $ \theta $ in degrees. Use the following steps:
1. Establish the destructive interference condition using path difference considerations.
2. Solve for $ \theta $ symbolically in terms of $ \lambda $ and $ a $.
3. Substitute the given numerical values to calculate $ \theta $.

Express the final answer in degrees, rounded to two decimal places. Omit the degree symbol (°) in the answer. Use $ \arcsin $ for the inverse sine function.

Note: $ 1  \text{nm} = 10^{-9}  \text{m} $ and $ 1  \text{mm} = 10^{-3}  \text{m} $.

## Solution
**Step 1: Derive the destructive interference condition**  
Consider the slit divided into two equal halves. For destructive interference at angle $ \theta $, waves from the top and bottom edges must have a path difference of $ \lambda / 2 $ (half-wavelength) when paired with waves from the center. The path difference between the top and bottom edges is $ a \sin \theta $. For the first minimum, this path difference must equal one full wavelength $ \lambda $:  
$$ a \sin \theta = \lambda $$  

**Step 2: Solve symbolically for $ \theta $**  
Rearrange the equation:  
$$ \sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{a} $$  
Apply the inverse sine function:  
$$ \theta = \arcsin \left( \frac{\lambda}{a} \right) $$  

**Step 3: Substitute numerical values**  
Convert units:  
$$ \lambda = 500  \text{nm} = 500 \times 10^{-9}  \text{m} = 5.00 \times 10^{-7}  \text{m} $$  
$$ a = 0.05  \text{mm} = 0.05 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m} = 5.00 \times 10^{-5}  \text{m} $$  
Compute the ratio:  
$$ \frac{\lambda}{a} = \frac{5.00 \times 10^{-7}}{5.00 \times 10^{-5}} = 0.01 $$  
Now evaluate:  
$$ \theta = \arcsin(0.01) $$  
Using a calculator (in degree mode):  
$$ \theta \approx 0.572938  \text{degrees} $$  
Round to two decimal places:  
$$ \theta \approx 0.57  \text{degrees} $$  

**Verification**:  
For small angles, $ \theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{a} $ radians. Convert to degrees:  
$$ \theta \approx \frac{5.00 \times 10^{-7}}{5.00 \times 10^{-5}} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 0.01 \times 57.2958 \approx 0.573  \text{degrees} $$  
This approximation aligns with the exact calculation.

## Problem 1
Background:
Single-slit diffraction occurs when light passes through a narrow aperture, producing a pattern of bright and dark fringes on a distant screen. The central maximum is the brightest and widest fringe, bounded by the first minima on either side. The angular width of the central maximum (Δθ) is defined as the angle between these two first minima. The condition for the first minimum is derived from destructive interference between wavelets originating from different parts of the slit. For small angles (typically < 10°), the relationship simplifies due to the small-angle approximation sin(θ) ≈ θ (in radians).

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Derivation of the first-minimum condition in single-slit diffraction using wave optics principles.
- Application of the small-angle approximation to simplify trigonometric relationships.
- Unit conversion (degrees to radians) and algebraic manipulation.
- Calculation of physical quantities using derived formulas.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects to wave interference phenomena (e.g., double-slit interference) and the broader study of wave optics.
- Reinforces the use of Huygens' principle to model wave propagation and interference.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Engineering: Optical instrument design (e.g., spectrometers) relies on controlling diffraction patterns.
- Astronomy: Diffraction limits the angular resolution of telescopes (Rayleigh criterion).

Real-World Applications:
- Designing experiments to measure unknown wavelengths of light sources.
- Optimizing slit widths in optical devices like monochromators for desired diffraction patterns.

Problem:
You are designing a single-slit diffraction experiment for a physics demonstration. The goal is to produce a central maximum with an angular width of 2.0° using a laser of wavelength 600 nm. 

Starting from fundamental wave optics principles:
1. Derive the condition for the first minimum in the diffraction pattern.
2. Using the small-angle approximation (valid for this setup), derive an expression for the slit width $a$ in terms of the angular width of the central maximum (Δθ) and the wavelength (λ).
3. Calculate the required slit width for the given parameters.

Express your final answer in meters, rounded to two significant figures. Provide only the numerical value in the box.

## Solution
### Step 1: Derive the condition for the first minimum
Consider a slit of width $a$. According to Huygens' principle, each point in the slit acts as a source of secondary wavelets. For destructive interference at an angle $\theta$ (measured from the central axis), the path difference between wavelets from the top and bottom edges must be half a wavelength. However, a more rigorous approach divides the slit into two equal halves. The path difference between wavelets from the top edge and the center is $\frac{a}{2} \sin \theta$. For destructive interference, this path difference must be $\frac{\lambda}{2}$:


$$
\frac{a}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{2}
$$


Solving for $\sin \theta$:


$$
a \sin \theta = \lambda
$$


This is the condition for the first minimum at angle $\theta$.

### Step 2: Relate $\theta$ to the angular width Δθ
The central maximum spans from $\theta = -\theta_{\text{min}}$ to $\theta = +\theta_{\text{min}}$, where $\theta_{\text{min}}$ is the angle to the first minimum. Thus, the angular width is:


$$
\Delta\theta = 2\theta
$$


where $\theta$ satisfies $a \sin \theta = \lambda$.

### Step 3: Apply the small-angle approximation
Given $\Delta\theta = 2.0^\circ$ (which is small), use $\sin \theta \approx \theta$ (with $\theta$ in radians). Substitute $\theta = \frac{\Delta\theta}{2}$:


$$
a \cdot \left(\frac{\Delta\theta}{2}\right) \approx \lambda
$$


Solve for $a$:


$$
a \approx \frac{2\lambda}{\Delta\theta}
$$


Note: $\Delta\theta$ must be in radians for the approximation.

### Step 4: Convert Δθ to radians

$$
\Delta\theta = 2.0^\circ \times \frac{\pi \text{ rad}}{180^\circ} = \frac{2.0 \pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{90} \text{ radians}
$$


### Step 5: Substitute values and calculate $a$
Wavelength $\lambda = 600 \text{ nm} = 600 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m} = 6.00 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}$.  
Using the expression from Step 3:


$$
a \approx \frac{2 \times (6.00 \times 10^{-7})}{\pi / 90} = \frac{1.20 \times 10^{-6} \times 90}{\pi} = \frac{1.08 \times 10^{-4}}{\pi}
$$


Numerical evaluation ($\pi \approx 3.1416$):


$$
a \approx \frac{1.08 \times 10^{-4}}{3.1416} \approx 3.438 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}
$$


### Step 6: Round to two significant figures

$$
a \approx 3.4 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}
$$


The required slit width is $3.4 \times 10^{-5}$ meters.

## Answer
$$\boxed{3.4 \times 10^{-5}}$$

## Problem 2
### Background
In modern optical communication systems, lasers are used to transmit information through fiber-optic cables. The wavelength of the laser light is a critical parameter that affects transmission efficiency. To measure an unknown wavelength, one common experimental technique involves analyzing the diffraction pattern produced when light passes through a narrow slit. When monochromatic light illuminates a single slit, it spreads out and forms a pattern of bright and dark fringes on a screen. The positions of these fringes depend on the slit width and the light's wavelength. The first diffraction minimum, where destructive interference occurs, is particularly important for calibration.

### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Condition for minima in single-slit diffraction**: Understanding that destructive interference occurs when the path difference between waves from opposite edges of the slit equals an integer multiple of the wavelength.
2. **Derivation of the wavelength**: Applying the formula for the first minimum to relate wavelength, slit width, and diffraction angle.
3. **Unit conversions**: Converting between millimeters and meters, and expressing wavelength in nanometers.
4. **Significant figures**: Rounding numerical answers appropriately based on given data precision.
5. **Trigonometric functions**: Evaluating sine for small angles.

### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to wave optics principles, including Huygens' principle and interference. It extends the study of light as a wave, which is foundational in understanding phenomena like polarization, diffraction gratings, and optical instruments.

### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Designing optical communication systems and spectrometers relies on diffraction principles.
- **Chemistry**: X-ray diffraction uses similar concepts to determine molecular structures.
- **Astronomy**: Analyzing light diffraction helps measure stellar properties.

### Real-World Applications
- **Fiber-optic communications**: Precisely measuring laser wavelengths ensures efficient data transmission.
- **Medical imaging**: Diffraction patterns are used in laser-based diagnostics and microscopy.
- **Material science**: Characterizing light sources for quality control in manufacturing.

### Problem Statement
In a laboratory experiment, a laser beam of unknown wavelength $\lambda$ passes through a single slit of width $a = 0.04  \text{mm}$. The resulting diffraction pattern shows its first minimum at an angle of $\theta = 3.0^\circ$ from the central maximum. Derive the condition for the first diffraction minimum and use it to find $\lambda$. Express your answer in nanometers and rounded to two significant figures. Provide only the numerical value.

## Solution
### Step 1: Derive the condition for the first minimum
In single-slit diffraction, destructive interference (minima) occurs when the path difference between waves from the top and bottom edges of the slit is an integer multiple of the wavelength. For the first minimum ($m = 1$), the condition is:

$$
a \sin \theta = \lambda
$$

where:
- $a$ is the slit width,
- $\theta$ is the angle from the central maximum to the first minimum,
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

### Step 2: Solve for the wavelength
Rearrange the equation to isolate $\lambda$:

$$
\lambda = a \sin \theta
$$


### Step 3: Substitute the given values
- Slit width: $a = 0.04  \text{mm}$
- Angle: $\theta = 3.0^\circ$

First, convert $a$ to meters (since wavelength is typically in meters):

$$
a = 0.04  \text{mm} = 0.04 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m} = 4.0 \times 10^{-5}  \text{m}
$$


Now compute $\sin \theta$:

$$
\sin(3.0^\circ) \approx 0.052335956
$$


Substitute into the equation:

$$
\lambda = (4.0 \times 10^{-5}) \times 0.052335956 = 2.09343824 \times 10^{-6}  \text{m}
$$


### Step 4: Convert to nanometers
Since $1  \text{m} = 10^9  \text{nm}$,

$$
\lambda = 2.09343824 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^9  \text{nm} = 2093.43824  \text{nm}
$$


### Step 5: Round to two significant figures
The given values have two significant figures ($0.04$ has two if interpreted as $4.0 \times 10^{-2}  \text{mm}$, and $3.0$ has two). Thus, round $2093.43824  \text{nm}$ to two significant figures:
- $2093.43824 \approx 2100  \text{nm}$ (since $2093$ rounds to $2100$).

**Final numerical value**: $2100  \text{nm}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{2100}$$

## Problem 3
Background: 
Single-slit diffraction occurs when light passes through a narrow aperture, creating an interference pattern on a distant screen. The pattern consists of a central bright fringe flanked by alternating dark and bright fringes. The first minima are the initial dark fringes adjacent to the central maximum, occurring where light waves interfere destructively. This principle is applied in optical engineering for precision measurements, such as determining the width of microscopic objects (e.g., human hairs or optical fibers) using laser diffraction.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Destructive interference condition for single-slit diffraction minima.
2. Small-angle approximation ($\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta \approx \theta$) for linearizing geometry.
3. Relationship between angular position and linear screen distance.
4. Symmetry in diffraction patterns.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects wave optics (interference conditions) with geometry (trigonometric approximations) and algebra (deriving expressions).
- Extends to multi-slit interference and resolution limits in wave optics.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Engineering: Used in designing optical instruments (e.g., spectrometers) and non-contact sensors.
- Materials Science: Applied to measure microfiber diameters or thin-film thicknesses.

Real-World Applications:
- Quality control in manufacturing: Laser diffraction measures wire thicknesses in real-time on production lines.
- Biomedical research: Determining cell or hair diameters without physical contact.

Problem:
Monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ illuminates a single slit of width $a$. The diffraction pattern is observed on a screen at distance $D$ from the slit.  
(a) Derive the condition for the first minimum using destructive interference.  
(b) Using the small-angle approximation, derive the linear distance $y$ from the central maximum to the first minimum.  
(c) Hence, derive the distance $w$ between the two first minima (on opposite sides of the central maximum).  
(d) For $\lambda = 450 \text{ nm}$, $a = 0.1 \text{ mm}$, and $D = 2.0 \text{ m}$, compute $w$.  
Express $w$ in meters, provide the numerical value only, and round to four significant figures.  
Note: $1 \text{ nm} = 10^{-9} \text{ m}$ and $1 \text{ mm} = 10^{-3} \text{ m}$.

## Solution
**(a) Condition for first minimum:**  
Destructive interference occurs when the path difference between waves from opposite edges of the slit equals half a wavelength. For the first minimum, the slit is divided into two halves, each contributing wave pairs with path difference $\lambda/2$. The angle $\theta$ satisfies:  
$$ a \sin \theta = \lambda $$  
where $a$ is the slit width and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

**(b) Linear distance to first minimum:**  
For small $\theta$ (in radians), $\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta = y / D$, where $y$ is the linear distance from the center to the first minimum. Substituting into the interference condition:  
$$ a \cdot \frac{y}{D} = \lambda $$  
Solving for $y$:  
$$ y = \frac{\lambda D}{a} $$  

**(c) Distance between first minima:**  
By symmetry, the two first minima are equidistant from the central maximum. Thus, the distance $w$ between them is:  
$$ w = 2y = \frac{2 \lambda D}{a} $$  

**(d) Numerical computation:**  
Given:  
- $\lambda = 450 \text{ nm} = 450 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$  
- $a = 0.1 \text{ mm} = 0.1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} = 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}$  
- $D = 2.0 \text{ m}$  

Substitute into the expression for $w$:  
$$ w = \frac{2 \times (450 \times 10^{-9}) \times 2.0}{1.0 \times 10^{-4}} $$  
Simplify numerator:  
$$ 2 \times 450 \times 10^{-9} \times 2.0 = 1800 \times 10^{-9} = 1.800 \times 10^{-6} $$  
Divide by denominator:  
$$ w = \frac{1.800 \times 10^{-6}}{1.0 \times 10^{-4}} = 1.800 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m} $$  
Rounded to four significant figures: $0.01800 \text{ m}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{0.01800}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**
Single-slit diffraction occurs when light passes through a narrow aperture, causing wavefronts to spread and interfere. This creates a pattern on a distant screen with a bright central maximum flanked by less intense secondary maxima.

Understanding this pattern is essential for applications like optical instrument design and spectroscopy, where controlling light spread is critical.

This problem connects to wave optics, specifically Huygens' principle and interference. It extends to Fourier optics, where the diffraction pattern is the Fourier transform of the slit function, and to quantum mechanics, where similar principles describe wave-particle duality.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
The mathematical techniques (solving $\tan \beta = \beta$) are used in engineering for antenna design and in mathematics for transcendental equations. The physics of diffraction applies to X-ray crystallography in chemistry and resolution limits in microscopy for biology.

**Real-World Applications**
- **Laser Systems**: Optimizing beam profiles in medical lasers for precise tissue ablation.
- **Spectrometry**: Analyzing light spectra to identify materials in environmental science.
- **Astronomy**: Calculating telescope resolution to distinguish closely spaced celestial objects.

**Problem**
Consider monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ incident on a single slit of width $a$. The intensity $I$ at an angle $\theta$ from the central axis is:
$$ I(\theta) = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin \beta}{\beta} \right)^2, \quad \beta = \frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}, $$
where $I_0$ is the central maximum intensity ($\theta = 0$). 

1. Derive the condition $\tan \beta = \beta$ for secondary maxima (excluding $\beta = 0$).
2. The first secondary maximum corresponds to the smallest positive root of $\tan \beta = \beta$, approximately $\beta_1 = 4.49340945790906$ radians. 
3. Calculate the intensity ratio $\frac{I_0}{I_1}$, where $I_1$ is the intensity at the first secondary maximum.

Express the ratio $\frac{I_0}{I_1}$ as a decimal number rounded to ten significant digits.

## Solution
**Step 1: Derive the condition for secondary maxima**  
The intensity is $I = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin \beta}{\beta} \right)^2$. Extrema occur where $\frac{dI}{d\beta} = 0$. Let $u = \frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}$, so:
$$
\frac{dI}{d\beta} = I_0 \cdot 2u \frac{du}{d\beta} = 0.
$$
This implies $u = 0$ or $\frac{du}{d\beta} = 0$.  
- $u = 0$ gives minima at $\sin \beta = 0$ ($\beta = n\pi, n \neq 0$).  
- For maxima, solve $\frac{du}{d\beta} = 0$:  
$$
\frac{du}{d\beta} = \frac{\beta \cos \beta - \sin \beta}{\beta^2} = 0 \implies \beta \cos \beta = \sin \beta.
$$
Rearranging yields:
$$
\tan \beta = \beta \quad (\beta \neq 0).
$$

**Step 2: Identify $\beta_1$ for the first secondary maximum**  
The smallest positive solution to $\tan \beta = \beta$ is $\beta_1 = 4.49340945790906$ radians (given).

**Step 3: Compute the intensity ratio $\frac{I_0}{I_1}$**  
At $\beta_1$, the intensity is:
$$
I_1 = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin \beta_1}{\beta_1} \right)^2.
$$
The ratio is:
$$
\frac{I_0}{I_1} = \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\sin \beta_1}{\beta_1} \right)^2} = \left( \frac{\beta_1}{\sin \beta_1} \right)^2.
$$
Since $\beta_1 \approx 4.49340945790906$ lies in the third quadrant ($\pi < \beta_1 < \frac{3\pi}{2}$), $\sin \beta_1 < 0$. From $\tan \beta_1 = \beta_1$:
$$
\sin \beta_1 = \beta_1 \cos \beta_1, \quad \sin^2 \beta_1 + \cos^2 \beta_1 = 1.
$$
Substituting $\cos \beta_1 = \frac{\sin \beta_1}{\beta_1}$ into the identity:
$$
\sin^2 \beta_1 + \left( \frac{\sin \beta_1}{\beta_1} \right)^2 = 1 \implies \sin^2 \beta_1 (1 + \beta_1^{-2}) = 1.
$$
Solving for $\sin \beta_1$ (negative in third quadrant):
$$
\sin \beta_1 = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \beta_1^{-2}}} = -\frac{\beta_1}{\sqrt{1 + \beta_1^2}}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\frac{\beta_1}{\sin \beta_1} = \frac{\beta_1}{-\frac{\beta_1}{\sqrt{1 + \beta_1^2}}} = -\sqrt{1 + \beta_1^2}.
$$
Squaring gives:
$$
\left( \frac{\beta_1}{\sin \beta_1} \right)^2 = (-\sqrt{1 + \beta_1^2})^2 = 1 + \beta_1^2.
$$
Substitute $\beta_1 = 4.49340945790906$:
$$
\beta_1^2 = (4.49340945790906)^2 = 20.187380292, \\
1 + \beta_1^2 = 21.187380292.
$$
Rounded to ten significant digits:  
21.187380292 → 21.18738029 (11th digit is 2 < 5, no rounding up).

## Answer
$$\boxed{21.18738029}$$

# standing waves and resonance phenomena

## Problem 0
**Background**

Waves on a string are transverse mechanical waves that propagate due to tension and are governed by the wave equation. When a string of length $L$ is fixed at both ends and disturbed, it forms standing waves through constructive interference between incident and reflected waves. Resonance occurs at specific frequencies called harmonics, with the fundamental frequency (first harmonic) being the lowest possible frequency that produces a standing wave. The speed of wave propagation depends on the string's tension $T$ (force restoring equilibrium) and linear density $\mu$ (mass per unit length).

**Knowledge Points Tested**
- Derivation of wave speed from Newton's laws for a string under tension.
- Boundary conditions for fixed ends and their implications for wavelength.
- Relationship between wave speed, wavelength, and frequency.
- Formation of standing waves and the fundamental mode.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
- Connects to harmonic motion (oscillation of string segments) and wave superposition (interference patterns).
- Extends to higher harmonics and Fourier analysis of complex waveforms.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
- Music: Fundamental frequency determines pitch in string instruments (e.g., guitar, violin).
- Engineering: Resonance principles apply to vibration analysis in bridges and cables.

**Real-World Applications**
- Tuning musical instruments by adjusting tension $T$ or length $L$ to achieve desired frequencies.
- Designing acoustic sensors that detect resonant frequencies in structural health monitoring.

**Problem Statement**

Consider a uniform string of length $L$, fixed rigidly at both ends, with constant linear density $\mu$ and tension $T$. Derive an expression for the fundamental frequency $f_1$ of the standing waves produced on this string. Begin by modeling the wave speed from basic principles, then apply boundary conditions to determine the fundamental wavelength, and finally relate it to the frequency. Express $f_1$ symbolically in terms of $L$, $T$, and $\mu$.

**Final Answer Format**  
Provide a single symbolic expression for $f_1$ in terms of $L$, $T$, and $\mu$. Use the form $\frac{a}{b} \sqrt{\frac{c}{d}}$ with explicit fractions. Do not substitute numerical values or constants.

## Solution
**Step 1: Derive the wave speed $v$**  
Consider a small element of the string with length $\Delta x$ and mass $\Delta m = \mu \Delta x$. Under tension $T$, the net transverse force on the element is $T (\sin \theta_2 - \sin \theta_1)$, where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are angles at the endpoints. For small displacements, $\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta \approx \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$, so:  
$$ F_{\text{net}} \approx T \left( \left. \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right|_{x+\Delta x} - \left. \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right|_{x} \right) = T \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \Delta x. $$  
By Newton's second law:  
$$ F_{\text{net}} = (\mu \Delta x) \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}. $$  
Equating expressions:  
$$ T \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \Delta x = \mu \Delta x \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} \implies \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\mu}{T} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}. $$  
This is the wave equation $\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}$, where:  
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}. $$  

**Step 2: Apply boundary conditions for fundamental mode**  
For a string fixed at $x=0$ and $x=L$, the displacement must satisfy $y(0,t)=0$ and $y(L,t)=0$. Standing waves have the form:  
$$ y(x,t) = A \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t). $$  
Boundary condition at $x=L$:  
$$ \sin(kL) = 0 \implies kL = n\pi \quad (n=1,2,3,\ldots). $$  
Thus, $k = \frac{n\pi}{L}$ and wavelength $\lambda_n = \frac{2\pi}{k} = \frac{2L}{n}$. The fundamental mode (longest wavelength) occurs at $n=1$:  
$$ \lambda_1 = 2L. $$  

**Step 3: Relate frequency to wave speed and wavelength**  
The general wave relationship is $v = f \lambda$. For the fundamental frequency:  
$$ f_1 = \frac{v}{\lambda_1} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}}{2L}. $$  
Simplifying:  
$$ f_1 = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}. $$  
This is the expression for the fundamental frequency.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\dfrac{T}{\mu}}}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
In acoustics, resonance tubes with one open end and one closed end are commonly used to measure the speed of sound in air. When a tuning fork of frequency $f$ vibrates near the open end, it creates sound waves that travel down the tube and reflect off the closed end. Standing waves form when the length of the air column satisfies specific conditions for constructive interference. The closed end must be a displacement node (where air particles cannot oscillate), and the open end approximates a displacement antinode (where oscillation is maximal). For resonance to occur, the tube length $L$ must accommodate an odd number of quarter-wavelengths ($\lambda/4$) of the sound wave.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Fundamental principles of standing wave formation in air columns.  
2. Relationship between tube length, wavelength, and harmonic number for tubes with one closed end.  
3. Wave equation $v = f\lambda$ to derive the speed of sound.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to wave mechanics (boundary conditions, nodes/antinodes), harmonic series (odd harmonics in closed-end tubes), and the superposition principle (constructive interference for standing waves).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Engineering**: Design of wind instruments (e.g., clarinets) relies on resonance frequencies.  
- **Geophysics**: Similar principles apply to seismic wave resonance in geological structures.  
- **Medicine**: Ultrasonic imaging uses resonant frequencies to detect tissue boundaries.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Resonance tube experiments are standard in physics labs to measure the speed of sound. Accurate measurements aid in calibrating audio equipment, designing concert halls, and developing noise-cancellation technologies.  

**Problem Statement**  
A resonance tube with one open end and one closed end is used in an experiment. When a tuning fork of frequency $f$ is struck near the open end, the **second resonance** (i.e., the second harmonic) occurs at an air column length of $L$. Derive an expression for the speed of sound $v$ in air in terms of $f$ and $L$.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Express $v$ symbolically using only the variables $f$ and $L$.

## Solution
### Step 1: Identify the harmonic condition for resonance  
For a tube with one closed end, resonances occur at odd harmonics. The $n$-th resonance corresponds to the $(2n-1)$-th harmonic. The second resonance occurs at the **third harmonic** ($n=2$, so harmonic number $2(2)-1 = 3$).  

### Step 2: Relate tube length to wavelength  
At resonance, the tube length $L$ must accommodate an odd number of quarter-wavelengths. For the third harmonic (first overtone), the standing wave pattern has **three quarter-wavelengths** in the tube. This gives:  
$$ L = \frac{3\lambda}{4} $$  
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the sound wave.  

### Step 3: Solve for the wavelength  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $\lambda$:  
$$ \lambda = \frac{4L}{3} $$  

### Step 4: Apply the wave equation  
The speed of sound $v$ is related to frequency $f$ and wavelength $\lambda$ by:  
$$ v = f \lambda $$  

### Step 5: Substitute and derive the expression  
Substitute $\lambda = \frac{4L}{3}$ into the wave equation:  
$$ v = f \cdot \frac{4L}{3} = \frac{4fL}{3} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The speed of sound in air for the given resonance condition is $\frac{4fL}{3}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{4fL}{3}}$$

## Problem 2
**Background:**  
Guitar strings produce sound through standing waves formed when plucked. The fundamental frequency (lowest resonant frequency) depends on the string's length, tension, and mass per unit length. This frequency determines the musical note. For a string fixed at both ends, the fundamental frequency arises from a single antinode between two nodes.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Derivation of wave speed on a string: $ v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} $, where $ T $ is tension and $ \mu $ is linear mass density.  
- Relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength: $ v = f\lambda $.  
- Wavelength of the fundamental mode for a string fixed at both ends: $ \lambda = 2L $.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects to harmonic series: Higher harmonics (frequencies $ nf_1 $) arise from integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.  
- Relates to wave interference: Standing waves form via superposition of incident and reflected waves.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Acoustics/Music Theory:** Fundamental frequency determines pitch (e.g., 330 Hz is E₄ on the musical scale).  
- **Engineering:** Tension calibration is critical in designing string instruments for accurate tonality.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Tuning musical instruments (e.g., guitars, pianos) by adjusting string tension.  
- Quality control in string manufacturing to ensure consistent density and elasticity.  

**Problem Statement:**  
A guitar string has a length $ L = 2  \text{m} $ and mass $ m = 5  \text{g} $. Calculate the tension $ T $ (in newtons) required to produce a fundamental frequency of $ f_1 = 330  \text{Hz} $.  

Derive $ T $ symbolically in terms of $ L $, $ m $, and $ f_1 $, then compute the numerical value.  
- **Linear mass density** $ \mu = \frac{m}{L} $.  
- Use the wave speed equation $ v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} $ and the fundamental frequency condition $ v = f_1 \lambda_1 $.  

Express the final answer as an exact numerical value.

## Solution
**Step 1: Express the wavelength for the fundamental mode.**  
For a string fixed at both ends, the fundamental mode has wavelength:  
$$ \lambda_1 = 2L $$  

**Step 2: Relate wave speed to frequency and wavelength.**  
The wave speed $ v $ is given by:  
$$ v = f_1 \lambda_1 = f_1 \cdot 2L $$  

**Step 3: Relate wave speed to tension and linear mass density.**  
The wave speed also depends on tension $ T $ and linear mass density $ \mu $:  
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} $$  
where $ \mu = \frac{m}{L} $.  

**Step 4: Equate the two expressions for wave speed.**  
Set the expressions from Steps 2 and 3 equal:  
$$ \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} = 2L f_1 $$  

**Step 5: Solve for tension $ T $.**  
Square both sides to eliminate the square root:  
$$ \frac{T}{\mu} = (2L f_1)^2 $$  
Multiply both sides by $ \mu $:  
$$ T = \mu (2L f_1)^2 $$  
Substitute $ \mu = \frac{m}{L} $:  
$$ T = \frac{m}{L} \cdot 4L^2 f_1^2 = 4mL f_1^2 $$  

**Step 6: Substitute numerical values.**  
Given:  
- $ m = 5  \text{g} = 0.005  \text{kg} $ (SI units)  
- $ L = 2  \text{m} $  
- $ f_1 = 330  \text{Hz} $  
Substitute into the derived formula:  
$$ T = 4 \times (0.005) \times (2) \times (330)^2 $$  
Compute step by step:  
- $ 330^2 = 108900 $  
- $ 4 \times 0.005 = 0.02 $  
- $ 0.02 \times 2 = 0.04 $  
- $ 0.04 \times 108900 = 4356 $  

**Conclusion:**  
The tension required is $ 4356  \text{N} $.

## Answer
$$\boxed{4356}$$

## Problem 3
**Background:**  
When two sound waves of slightly different frequencies are superimposed, they produce a phenomenon known as beats. Beats manifest as a periodic variation in loudness (amplitude) due to constructive and destructive interference. This is commonly observed when tuning musical instruments, such as using tuning forks to match frequencies. The beat frequency is the rate at which these loudness maxima occur.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. **Wave Superposition:** The principle that the total displacement of overlapping waves is the sum of their individual displacements.  
2. **Trigonometric Identities:** Application of sum-to-product identities to simplify the superposition of sine waves.  
3. **Beat Frequency Definition:** The frequency of the amplitude modulation envelope resulting from interfering waves.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This problem connects to wave interference in physics, particularly standing waves (e.g., in vibrating strings or air columns) and resonance. The beat frequency concept extends to analyzing harmonics and damping in oscillatory systems.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
In music, beats are used to tune instruments by minimizing the beat frequency. In engineering, beats underpin heterodyning in radio receivers, where two signals are mixed to produce an intermediate frequency.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Piano tuning: A tuner adjusts string tension until beats disappear, indicating matched frequencies.  
- Doppler radar: Beats measure relative velocity by comparing reflected and transmitted wave frequencies.  

**Problem Statement:**  
Two tuning forks with frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ (where $f_1 \neq f_2$) vibrate simultaneously. The resulting sound waves are:  

$$
y_1 = A \sin(2\pi f_1 t) \quad \text{and} \quad y_2 = A \sin(2\pi f_2 t),
$$
  
where $A$ is the amplitude (identical for both), and $t$ is time.  

Using the superposition principle and trigonometric identities, derive an expression for the beat frequency $f_{\text{beat}}$. The beat frequency is defined as the frequency of the amplitude modulation (loudness variation) in the combined wave $y = y_1 + y_2$.  

**Final Answer Format:**  
Express $f_{\text{beat}}$ symbolically in terms of $f_1$ and $f_2$. Use absolute value to ensure positivity. For example, if the answer is the absolute difference, write it as $|f_1 - f_2|$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply the superposition principle.**  
The combined wave is the sum of the individual waves:  

$$
y = y_1 + y_2 = A \sin(2\pi f_1 t) + A \sin(2\pi f_2 t).
$$
  
Factoring out $A$:  

$$
y = A \left[ \sin(2\pi f_1 t) + \sin(2\pi f_2 t) \right].
$$
  

**Step 2: Use the sum-to-product trigonometric identity.**  
The identity for the sum of two sines is:  

$$
\sin a + \sin b = 2 \sin\left( \frac{a+b}{2} \right) \cos\left( \frac{a-b}{2} \right).
$$
  
Substitute $a = 2\pi f_1 t$ and $b = 2\pi f_2 t$:  

$$
y = A \left[ 2 \sin\left( \frac{2\pi f_1 t + 2\pi f_2 t}{2} \right) \cos\left( \frac{2\pi f_1 t - 2\pi f_2 t}{2} \right) \right].
$$
  
Simplify the arguments:  

$$
y = 2A \sin\left( \pi (f_1 + f_2) t \right) \cos\left( \pi (f_1 - f_2) t \right).
$$
  

**Step 3: Identify the amplitude modulation.**  
The combined wave can be rewritten as:  

$$
y = \underbrace{\left[ 2A \cos\left( \pi (f_1 - f_2) t \right) \right]}_{\text{Amplitude envelope}} \cdot \sin\left( \pi (f_1 + f_2) t \right).
$$
  
The amplitude envelope is $ 2A \left| \cos\left( \pi (f_1 - f_2) t \right) \right| $ (absolute value ensures non-negative amplitude).  

**Step 4: Derive the beat frequency from the envelope.**  
The beat frequency $f_{\text{beat}}$ is the frequency of the envelope. The envelope depends on $\cos\left( \pi (f_1 - f_2) t \right)$, which has angular frequency $\omega_{\text{env}} = \pi |f_1 - f_2|$ (absolute value accounts for frequency differences). The frequency $f_{\text{env}}$ of $\cos(\omega_{\text{env}} t)$ is:  

$$
f_{\text{env}} = \frac{\omega_{\text{env}}}{2\pi} = \frac{\pi |f_1 - f_2|}{2\pi} = \frac{|f_1 - f_2|}{2}.
$$
  
However, the **intensity** (proportional to amplitude squared) determines perceived loudness. The intensity $I$ is:  

$$
I \propto \left[ 2A \cos\left( \pi (f_1 - f_2) t \right) \right]^2 = 4A^2 \cos^2\left( \pi (f_1 - f_2) t \right).
$$
  
Using the identity $\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \cos(2\theta) \right]$:  

$$
I \propto 4A^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \cos\left( 2\pi (f_1 - f_2) t \right) \right] = 2A^2 \left[ 1 + \cos\left( 2\pi |f_1 - f_2|  t \right) \right].
$$
  
The $\cos\left( 2\pi |f_1 - f_2|  t \right)$ term oscillates at frequency $|f_1 - f_2|$, so the intensity varies at this frequency. Since loudness maxima occur at each peak of the cosine (twice per full cycle of the envelope), the beat frequency is:  

$$
f_{\text{beat}} = |f_1 - f_2|.
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{|f_1 - f_2|}$$

# stopping distance calculations

## Problem 0
Background:
In automotive safety, understanding stopping distances on inclines is critical. When a car travels downhill, gravity contributes to its motion, reducing the effectiveness of braking. The slope of a road is quantified by its grade, defined as the tangent of the angle of incline (θ) expressed as a percentage. For small angles (typically < 10°), sinθ ≈ tanθ is a valid approximation, simplifying calculations.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Newton's second law applied to motion along an inclined plane.
- Kinematics equations for constant acceleration, specifically $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad$.
- Vector decomposition of gravitational force on a slope.
- Small-angle approximation (sinθ ≈ tanθ) for practical scenarios.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem integrates force analysis from dynamics with kinematic equations, demonstrating how net acceleration determines motion. It reinforces the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration while applying coordinate-based vector decomposition.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The concept connects to civil engineering (road design gradients), transportation safety (braking distance standards), and environmental science (terrain impact on vehicle efficiency). It also illustrates mathematical approximations in physics-based modeling.

Real-World Applications:
Calculating stopping distances on slopes is vital for driver education, highway design (e.g., runaway truck ramps), and vehicle safety testing. For example, mountainous regions require adjusted speed limits based on grade to prevent accidents.

Problem:
A car travels downhill on a straight road with a constant 5% grade (i.e., tanθ = 0.05). The car's initial speed is 20 m/s. The brakes provide a maximum deceleration of 4 m/s² relative to the road surface on flat ground. On this downhill slope, the braking force remains constant and equal to the maximum force achievable on flat ground. Using the small-angle approximation sinθ ≈ tanθ and $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$ for gravitational acceleration, calculate the stopping distance in meters. Neglect air resistance and rolling friction.

Express your final answer numerically, rounded to two decimal places.

## Solution
### Step 1: Define the coordinate system and forces
- Choose the direction of motion (downhill) as positive.
- The net force along the incline has two components:
  - Gravitational force component parallel to slope: $mg \sin \theta$ (downhill, positive).
  - Braking force: Constant magnitude $F_b = m \cdot a_b$, where $a_b = 4  \text{m/s}^2$ (uphill, negative). Since the braking force opposes motion, it is $-m \cdot 4$.

### Step 2: Apply Newton's second law
Net force parallel to incline:

$$
F_{\text{net}} = mg \sin \theta - m \cdot 4
$$

Divide by mass $m$ to find net acceleration:

$$
a_{\text{net}} = g \sin \theta - 4
$$


### Step 3: Apply kinematics equation
Use $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a d$, where:
- $v_f = 0$ (stopped),
- $v_i = 20  \text{m/s}$,
- $a = a_{\text{net}} = g \sin \theta - 4$,
- $d$ = stopping distance (unknown).

Substitute values:

$$
0 = (20)^2 + 2(g \sin \theta - 4) d
$$

Solve for $d$:

$$
400 = -2(g \sin \theta - 4) d
$$


$$
d = \frac{400}{2(4 - g \sin \theta)} = \frac{200}{4 - g \sin \theta}
$$


### Step 4: Substitute numerical values
- $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$,
- $\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta = 0.05$ (5% grade approximation).


$$
d = \frac{200}{4 - (9.8)(0.05)} = \frac{200}{4 - 0.49} = \frac{200}{3.51}
$$


### Step 5: Compute and round

$$
d = \frac{200}{3.51} \approx 56.98005698
$$

Rounded to two decimal places:

$$
d = 56.98
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{56.98}$$

## Problem 1
**Background**

Stopping distance is a critical concept in traffic safety and vehicle dynamics. It represents the total distance a vehicle travels from the moment a driver perceives a hazard until the vehicle comes to a complete stop. This distance consists of two components:  
- **Reaction distance**: Distance covered during the driver's reaction time while traveling at constant speed.  
- **Braking distance**: Distance covered while decelerating to a stop after brakes are applied.  

Understanding stopping distance helps design safer roads, optimize traffic signals, and establish speed limits. The calculations rely on fundamental kinematics principles, specifically motion at constant velocity (reaction phase) and motion under constant acceleration (braking phase).

**Problem**  
A driver travels at a constant speed of 25 m/s on a straight road. Upon noticing an obstacle, the driver takes 0.8 seconds to react and apply the brakes. Once applied, the brakes generate a constant deceleration of 5 m/s². Derive the total stopping distance (from hazard perception to full stop) as a numerical value.  

Express your answer as a decimal number without units.

## Solution
**Step 1: Calculate reaction distance**  
During the reaction time $t_r = 0.8 \, \text{s}$, the vehicle moves at constant initial velocity $v_i = 25 \, \text{m/s}$. The distance traveled is:  

$$
d_{\text{reaction}} = v_i \cdot t_r = 25 \times 0.8 = 20 \, \text{m}.
$$


**Step 2: Calculate braking distance**  
After brakes are applied, the vehicle decelerates at $a = -5 \, \text{m/s}^2$ (negative for deceleration). Initial velocity during braking is $v_i = 25 \, \text{m/s}$, and final velocity $v_f = 0 \, \text{m/s}$. Using the kinematic equation:  

$$
v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a d_{\text{braking}}.
$$
  
Substitute known values:  

$$
0^2 = (25)^2 + 2(-5) d_{\text{braking}}.
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
0 = 625 - 10 d_{\text{braking}}.
$$
  
Solve for $d_{\text{braking}}$:  

$$
d_{\text{braking}} = \frac{625}{10} = 62.5 \, \text{m}.
$$


**Step 3: Calculate total stopping distance**  
The total stopping distance is the sum of reaction and braking distances:  

$$
d_{\text{total}} = d_{\text{reaction}} + d_{\text{braking}} = 20 + 62.5 = 82.5 \, \text{m}.
$$
  
The numerical value (without units) is $82.5$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{82.5}$$

## Problem 2
### Background
When a vehicle brakes, the friction between the tires and the road surface generates a force that decelerates the car. The maximum friction force depends on the coefficient of kinetic friction (μ<sub>k</sub>), which varies with road conditions (e.g., dry, wet, icy). Wet roads significantly reduce μ<sub>k</sub>, increasing braking distance. This problem explores the physics behind stopping distances, emphasizing the interplay between dynamics (friction forces) and kinematics (motion under constant acceleration).

### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Newton's second law**: The net force acting on an object equals its mass multiplied by its acceleration ($F_{\text{net}} = m a$).
2. **Friction force**: The kinetic friction force is given by $f_k = \mu_k N$, where $N$ is the normal force.
3. **Kinematics**: The equation $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a d$ for motion under constant acceleration, where $v_f$ is final velocity, $v_i$ is initial velocity, $a$ is acceleration, and $d$ is displacement.

### Intradisciplinary Connections
- This problem integrates **dynamics** (force analysis via Newton's laws) and **kinematics** (motion equations). It demonstrates how forces cause changes in motion (acceleration) and how that acceleration determines displacement.
- It reinforces the concept that friction, a dissipative force, converts kinetic energy into thermal energy, though the derivation here uses force and kinematics rather than energy methods.

### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Automotive Engineering**: Braking distance calculations inform brake system design and vehicle safety testing.
- **Traffic Safety**: Understanding stopping distances is critical for setting speed limits, designing traffic signals, and establishing safe following distances in driver education.
- **Materials Science**: The coefficient of friction depends on tire rubber composition and road surface properties, linking to material wear and environmental adaptations.

### Real-World Applications
- **Vehicle Safety Testing**: Organizations like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) use braking distance metrics to rate vehicle safety.
- **Accident Reconstruction**: Investigators calculate stopping distances to determine vehicle speeds prior to collisions.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars rely on real-time stopping distance calculations to adjust speed and maintain safe distances.

### Problem Statement
A car of mass $m$ travels at an initial speed $v_0$ on a straight, level wet road. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the tires and the road surface is $\mu_k$. Derive an expression for the braking distance $d$ (the distance the car travels while decelerating to a complete stop) in terms of $v_0$, $\mu_k$, and $g$ (the acceleration due to gravity).  

After deriving the general expression, compute the numerical value of $d$ for:  
- $m = 1200  \text{kg}$,  
- $v_0 = 18  \text{m/s}$,  
- $\mu_k = 0.4$,  
- $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$.  

Express your final numerical answer in meters, rounded to two decimal places.

## Solution
### Step 1: Analyze forces and apply Newton's second law
The only horizontal force acting on the car during braking is the kinetic friction force $f_k$, which opposes the motion. This force is given by:  
$$ f_k = \mu_k N $$  
Since the road is level, the normal force $N$ equals the car's weight:  
$$ N = mg $$  
Thus,  
$$ f_k = \mu_k mg $$  
By Newton's second law, the net force in the direction of motion is:  
$$ -f_k = ma $$  
where the negative sign indicates deceleration. Substituting $f_k$:  
$$ -\mu_k mg = ma $$  
Solving for acceleration $a$:  
$$ a = -\mu_k g $$  

### Step 2: Apply kinematics to find braking distance
The car decelerates uniformly from initial velocity $v_0$ to final velocity $v_f = 0$. Using the kinematics equation:  
$$ v_f^2 = v_0^2 + 2ad $$  
Substitute $v_f = 0$ and $a = -\mu_k g$:  
$$ 0 = v_0^2 + 2(-\mu_k g)d $$  
Rearrange to solve for $d$:  
$$ 0 = v_0^2 - 2\mu_k g d $$  
$$ 2\mu_k g d = v_0^2 $$  
$$ d = \frac{v_0^2}{2\mu_k g} $$  
This is the general expression for braking distance.  

### Step 3: Numerical substitution
Given:  
- $v_0 = 18  \text{m/s}$,  
- $\mu_k = 0.4$,  
- $g = 9.8  \text{m/s}^2$.  

Substitute into the derived formula:  
$$ d = \frac{(18)^2}{2 \cdot 0.4 \cdot 9.8} = \frac{324}{7.84} \approx 41.3265306122449 $$  
Rounded to two decimal places:  
$$ d = 41.33  \text{m} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{41.33}$$

## Problem 3
## Background
Stopping distance is the distance a vehicle travels from the moment braking begins until it comes to a complete stop. This concept is crucial in automotive safety, traffic engineering, and physics education. For constant deceleration, stopping distance depends on the initial speed and the deceleration magnitude. The relationship between speed and stopping distance is quadratic, meaning small speed increases lead to disproportionately larger stopping distances. This principle explains why speed limits are strictly enforced in high-risk areas like school zones.

## Knowledge Points Tested
- Kinematics equations for motion with constant acceleration (deceleration).
- Algebraic manipulation to derive relationships between physical quantities.
- Interpretation of quadratic dependence in physical systems.

## Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to Newton's second law (force relates to deceleration) and energy principles (kinetic energy dissipation during braking). It also extends to advanced topics like crash dynamics and impulse-momentum calculations.

## Interdisciplinary Connections
In traffic engineering, this principle informs speed limit design and brake system specifications. Environmental science applications include calculating emissions during deceleration phases, and mathematics ties include quadratic functions and ratio analysis.

## Real-World Applications
Vehicle safety testing (e.g., NHTSA crash ratings), autonomous emergency braking systems, and runway length design for aircraft. For example, a car at 60 mph requires about 4 times the stopping distance of a car at 30 mph.

## Problem Statement
A car traveling at an initial speed $u$ undergoes constant deceleration $a$ (where $a > 0$) until it stops. The stopping distance is $s$. If the initial speed doubles to $2u$ while maintaining the same deceleration $a$, derive an expression for the new stopping distance $s'$ in terms of the original stopping distance $s$. Specifically, determine the ratio $s'/s$.  

**Required format for the final answer:** Express the ratio $s'/s$ as a simplified integer or fraction. Do not include variables $u$, $a$, or any units in the boxed answer.

## Solution
### Step 1: Recall the kinematics equation for stopping distance  
The equation relating initial velocity ($u$), final velocity ($v$), acceleration ($a$), and displacement ($s$) is:  
$$ v^2 = u^2 + 2as $$  
When the vehicle stops, $v = 0$. For deceleration, acceleration is negative, so we substitute $-a$ (where $a > 0$):  
$$ 0 = u^2 + 2(-a)s $$  
Simplify to solve for $s$:  
$$ 0 = u^2 - 2as $$  
$$ 2as = u^2 $$  
$$ s = \frac{u^2}{2a} \quad \text{(Equation 1)} $$  

### Step 2: Apply the equation to the new scenario  
When the initial speed doubles to $2u$, with the same deceleration $a$, the new stopping distance $s'$ is:  
$$ s' = \frac{(2u)^2}{2a} $$  
Simplify:  
$$ s' = \frac{4u^2}{2a} = \frac{4u^2}{2a} = \frac{2u^2}{a} \quad \text{(Equation 2)} $$  

### Step 3: Derive the ratio $s'/s$  
Divide Equation 2 by Equation 1:  
$$ \frac{s'}{s} = \frac{\frac{2u^2}{a}}{\frac{u^2}{2a}} $$  
Simplify the compound fraction:  
$$ \frac{s'}{s} = \frac{2u^2}{a} \times \frac{2a}{u^2} = \frac{2u^2 \cdot 2a}{a \cdot u^2} = \frac{4u^2a}{au^2} $$  
Cancel common factors ($u^2$ and $a$):  
$$ \frac{s'}{s} = 4 $$  

### Conclusion  
The new stopping distance $s'$ is four times the original stopping distance $s$. Thus, the ratio $s'/s = 4$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{4}$$

# thermal equilibrium and zeroth law

## Problem 0
### Background
Thermal equilibrium is a state where two objects in thermal contact no longer exchange heat, reaching a common temperature. This principle, formalized by the zeroth law of thermodynamics, underlies many real-world applications, such as temperature stabilization in industrial processes, thermal management in electronics, and everyday scenarios like cooling hot food. The specific heat capacity of a material quantifies the heat energy required to change its temperature and is crucial for predicting thermal behavior.  

#### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics**: Defines thermal equilibrium and temperature equality.  
2. **Conservation of Energy**: Heat lost by one object equals heat gained by the other in an isolated system.  
3. **Heat Transfer Modeling**: Using $ Q = m c \Delta T $ to quantify heat exchange.  
4. **Algebraic Problem-Solving**: Deriving expressions from energy balance equations.  

#### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to **calorimetry** (measuring heat changes) and **kinetic theory** (linking heat capacity to molecular motion).  
- Extends to **phase changes** (e.g., latent heat) by emphasizing energy conservation without phase shifts here.  

#### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Materials Science**: Specific heat capacities influence material selection in engineering.  
- **Environmental Science**: Heat exchange models apply to climate systems (e.g., ocean-atmosphere interactions).  
- **Culinary Arts**: Predicting cooling/heating times in cooking.  

#### Real-World Applications
- **Electronics Cooling**: CPU heat sinks transfer heat to metals like aluminum/copper.  
- **Automotive Engineering**: Brake systems dissipate heat via metal components.  
- **Geothermal Energy**: Heat exchange between rocks and fluids underground.  

### Problem Statement
An aluminum block (mass $ m_A $, initial temperature $ T_{A0} $, specific heat capacity $ c_A $) and a copper block (mass $ m_C $, initial temperature $ T_{C0} $, specific heat capacity $ c_C $) are placed in thermal contact within an isolated system. Derive an expression for the equilibrium temperature $ T $ reached by both blocks.  

Express $ T $ symbolically in terms of $ m_A $, $ m_C $, $ T_{A0} $, $ T_{C0} $, $ c_A $, and $ c_C $.  

**Assumptions**:  
- No heat exchange with the environment.  
- No phase changes occur.  
- Constant specific heat capacities.

## Solution
### Derivation  
The system is isolated, so energy conservation applies: the heat lost by the initially hotter block equals the heat gained by the cooler block. Assume $ T_{C0} > T_{A0} $ (copper loses heat, aluminum gains heat).  

1. **Heat lost by copper block** ($ Q_{\text{lost}} $):  
   $$ Q_{\text{lost}} = m_C c_C (T_{C0} - T) $$  

2. **Heat gained by aluminum block** ($ Q_{\text{gained}} $):  
   $$ Q_{\text{gained}} = m_A c_A (T - T_{A0}) $$  

3. **Energy conservation** ($ Q_{\text{lost}} = Q_{\text{gained}} $):  
   $$ m_C c_C (T_{C0} - T) = m_A c_A (T - T_{A0}) $$  

4. **Expand and rearrange terms to solve for $ T $**:  
   $$ m_C c_C T_{C0} - m_C c_C T = m_A c_A T - m_A c_A T_{A0} $$  
   $$ m_C c_C T_{C0} + m_A c_A T_{A0} = m_A c_A T + m_C c_C T $$  
   $$ m_C c_C T_{C0} + m_A c_A T_{A0} = T (m_A c_A + m_C c_C) $$  

5. **Isolate $ T $**:  
   $$ T = \frac{m_A c_A T_{A0} + m_C c_C T_{C0}}{m_A c_A + m_C c_C} $$  

This expression is symmetric and holds regardless of which block is hotter. The numerator represents the total initial thermal energy (weighted by heat capacities), while the denominator is the total heat capacity of the system.

## Answer
$$ \boxed{\dfrac{m_{A} c_{A} T_{A0} + m_{C} c_{C} T_{C0}}{m_{A} c_{A} + m_{C} c_{C}}} $$

## Problem 1
**Background**  
Thermal expansion occurs when materials change dimensions due to temperature variations. The linear expansion of a solid rod is governed by its coefficient of linear expansion (α), which quantifies the fractional length change per degree of temperature change. When expansion is physically constrained, internal stress develops, linking thermal physics to material mechanics via Hooke's law and Young's modulus (Y).  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Derivation of thermal length change using α.  
- Calculation of thermal stress under constrained expansion.  
- Application of Young's modulus to relate stress and strain.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
- Connects thermal expansion (thermodynamics) to elastic deformation (mechanics) through the stress-strain relationship.  
- Reinforces the concept of strain as a dimensionless geometric response to external forces or temperature changes.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Materials Engineering**: Predicting failure points in thermally loaded structures.  
- **Civil Engineering**: Designing expansion joints in bridges to mitigate thermal stress.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- Railway tracks: Gaps between segments accommodate summer expansion to prevent buckling.  
- Pipelines: Expansion loops absorb thermal length changes to avoid ruptures.  

**Problem**  
A steel rod of initial length $L_0$ is rigidly clamped at both ends. It is initially at temperature $T_0$. When uniformly heated to temperature $T_f$, the rod cannot expand freely due to the clamps, generating compressive thermal stress. The coefficient of linear expansion for steel is $\alpha$, and Young's modulus is $Y$.  

Derive an expression for the thermal stress $\sigma$ in the rod. Express your answer **exclusively** in terms of $\alpha$, $Y$, and the temperature change $\Delta T = T_f - T_0$.  

**Required Format for the Final Answer**  
- Use the variables $\alpha$, $Y$, and $\Delta T$.  
- Express the stress $\sigma$ as a symbolic expression.  
- Do not include $L_0$, $T_0$, or $T_f$ in the final expression.

## Solution
**Step 1: Calculate free thermal expansion**  
If unconstrained, the rod's length change $\Delta L_{\text{free}}$ would be:  

$$
\Delta L_{\text{free}} = \alpha L_0 \Delta T
$$
  
where $\Delta T = T_f - T_0$.  

**Step 2: Determine constrained strain**  
Since the rod is clamped, its actual length change is zero. The clamps exert a compressive force to offset $\Delta L_{\text{free}}$. The effective compressive strain $\varepsilon$ is:  

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L_{\text{free}}}{L_0} = \frac{\alpha L_0 \Delta T}{L_0} = \alpha \Delta T
$$
  

**Step 3: Relate stress to strain using Young's modulus**  
Stress $\sigma$ is given by Hooke's law:  

$$
\sigma = Y \varepsilon
$$
  
Substituting $\varepsilon = \alpha \Delta T$:  

$$
\sigma = Y (\alpha \Delta T)
$$
  

**Final expression for thermal stress:**  

$$
\sigma = Y \alpha \Delta T
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{Y \alpha \Delta T}$$

------
## Problem 2
**Background**  
Thermal expansion is a fundamental phenomenon where materials change volume in response to temperature changes. The zeroth law of thermodynamics establishes thermal equilibrium, implying that when two objects are in contact, they eventually reach the same temperature. In this problem, a glass flask filled with mercury is heated, causing both to expand. However, mercury expands more than glass, leading to spillage. This scenario models real-world systems like mercury thermometers, where differential expansion is harnessed for measurement.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Volume expansion coefficients for solids and liquids.  
- Application of the formula for volume expansion: $\Delta V = V_0 \beta \Delta T$.  
- Net overflow calculation due to differential expansion between a container and its contents.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to heat transfer (thermal equilibrium) and material properties (expansion coefficients). It extends linear expansion ($\Delta L = L_0 \alpha \Delta T$) to volume expansion via $\beta \approx 3\alpha$, reinforcing how microscopic changes manifest macroscopically.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Engineering**: Designing systems with thermal stress management (e.g., expansion joints in bridges).  
- **Materials Science**: Selecting compatible materials in bimetallic strips or sealed containers.  
- **Meteorology**: Understanding thermal expansion of liquids in environmental sensors.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Thermometers**: Mercury expansion relative to glass measures temperature.  
- **Coolant Systems**: Automotive radiators use overflow tanks to handle expanded coolant.  
- **Electronic Packaging**: Microchip substrates use low-expansion materials (e.g., borosilicate glass) to prevent cracking.  

**Problem Statement**  
A borosilicate glass flask is completely filled with 150 mL of mercury at 10.0°C. The system is heated to 90.0°C. The coefficient of volume expansion for mercury is $\beta_m$, and for the glass flask is $\beta_g$. Derive an expression for the volume of mercury that spills out. Express your answer in terms of the initial volume $V_0$, the temperature change $\Delta T$, and the expansion coefficients $\beta_m$ and $\beta_g$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define initial conditions**  
- Initial volume of mercury and flask interior: $V_0 = 150  \text{mL}$.  
- Initial temperature: $T_i = 10.0^\circ \text{C}$.  
- Final temperature: $T_f = 90.0^\circ \text{C}$.  
- Temperature change: $\Delta T = T_f - T_i = 80.0  \text{K}$ (since $\Delta T$ in Kelvin equals $\Delta T$ in Celsius).  

**Step 2: Express expanded volumes**  
- Volume of mercury after heating:  
  
$$ V_m = V_0 (1 + \beta_m \Delta T) $$
  
- Internal volume of flask after heating (as the flask expands, its capacity increases):  
  
$$ V_g = V_0 (1 + \beta_g \Delta T) $$
  

**Step 3: Calculate spilled volume**  
The spilled volume is the excess mercury volume over the expanded flask capacity:  

$$ \Delta V = V_m - V_g $$
  
Substitute the expressions for $V_m$ and $V_g$:  

$$ \Delta V = V_0 (1 + \beta_m \Delta T) - V_0 (1 + \beta_g \Delta T) $$
  

$$ \Delta V = V_0 \left[ 1 + \beta_m \Delta T - 1 - \beta_g \Delta T \right] $$
  

$$ \Delta V = V_0 (\beta_m \Delta T - \beta_g \Delta T) $$
  

$$ \Delta V = V_0 (\beta_m - \beta_g) \Delta T $$
  

**Conclusion**  
The volume of mercury spilled is $V_0 (\beta_m - \beta_g) \Delta T$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{V_0 \left( \beta_m - \beta_g \right) \Delta T}$$

## Problem 3
### Background
Thermal equilibrium occurs when two objects in contact reach the same temperature, governed by the zeroth law of thermodynamics. This problem explores heat transfer during phase changes and temperature adjustments when ice and water mix. Key principles include:
- **Specific heat capacity**: Energy required to change a substance's temperature without phase change.
- **Latent heat of fusion**: Energy absorbed or released during solid-liquid phase transitions at constant temperature.

- Solving thermal equilibrium problems involving phase changes.
- Analyzing energy conservation in multi-step processes.

#### Intradisciplinary Connections

#### Interdisciplinary Connections

#### Real-World Applications

- Beverage industry (chilling drinks efficiently).

### Problem Statement
An insulated container holds $m_i = 30 \, \text{g}$ of ice at $T_i = -5 \, \text{°C}$. It is mixed with $m_w = 120 \, \text{g}$ of water at $T_w = 40 \, \text{°C}$. Assume no heat loss. The specific heat capacity of ice is $c_i = 2.09 \, \text{J/(g·°C)}$, the specific heat capacity of water is $c_w = 4.18 \, \text{J/(g·°C)}$, and the latent heat of fusion for ice is $L_f = 334 \, \text{J/g}$.

1. Verify if the heat released by the original water cooling to $0 \, \text{°C}$ is sufficient to warm the ice to $0 \, \text{°C}$ and melt all of it.  
2. Derive the final equilibrium temperature $T_f$ if all ice melts. If not all ice melts, $T_f = 0 \, \text{°C}$ with partial melting.  

Express $T_f$ in degrees Celsius, rounded to one decimal place. Provide only the numerical value.

## Solution
### Solution
#### Step 1: Calculate heat required to warm ice to $0 \, \text{°C}$  
The temperature change is $\Delta T_{\text{ice}} = 0 - (-5) = 5 \, \text{°C}$.  

$$
Q_{\text{warm}} = m_i c_i \Delta T_{\text{ice}} = (30)(2.09)(5) = 313.5 \, \text{J}
$$


#### Step 2: Calculate heat required to melt all ice at $0 \, \text{°C}$  

$$
Q_{\text{melt}} = m_i L_f = (30)(334) = 10{,}020 \, \text{J}
$$
  
Total heat needed to convert ice to water at $0 \, \text{°C}$:  

$$
Q_{\text{needed}} = Q_{\text{warm}} + Q_{\text{melt}} = 313.5 + 10{,}020 = 10{,}333.5 \, \text{J}
$$


#### Step 3: Calculate heat released by water cooling to $0 \, \text{°C}$  

$$
Q_{\text{release}} = m_w c_w (T_w - 0) = (120)(4.18)(40) = 20{,}064 \, \text{J}
$$


#### Step 4: Compare $Q_{\text{release}}$ and $Q_{\text{needed}}$  
Since $20{,}064 > 10{,}333.5$, $Q_{\text{release}} > Q_{\text{needed}}$. Thus, all ice melts, and $T_f > 0 \, \text{°C}$.

#### Step 5: Set up energy conservation equation  
- **Heat gained by ice**:  
  - Warming ice to $0 \, \text{°C}$: $m_i c_i (5)$  
  - Melting ice: $m_i L_f$  
  - Warming melted ice (now water) to $T_f$: $m_i c_w (T_f - 0)$  
- **Heat lost by original water**: $m_w c_w (40 - T_f)$  

Conservation of energy:  

$$
m_i c_i (5) + m_i L_f + m_i c_w T_f = m_w c_w (40 - T_f)
$$


#### Step 6: Solve for $T_f$  

$$
(30)(2.09)(5) + (30)(334) + (30)(4.18)T_f = (120)(4.18)(40 - T_f)
$$
  

$$
313.5 + 10{,}020 + 125.4 T_f = 20{,}064 - 501.6 T_f
$$
  
Combine like terms:  

$$
125.4 T_f + 501.6 T_f = 20{,}064 - 313.5 - 10{,}020
$$
  

$$
627 T_f = 9{,}730.5
$$
  

$$
T_f = \frac{9{,}730.5}{627} \approx 15.51898
$$
  
Rounded to one decimal place:  

$$
T_f = 15.5 \, \text{°C}

## Problem 4
Background:
When materials are heated, their lengths change due to thermal expansion. The change in length depends on the material's coefficient of linear expansion, the original length, and the temperature change. The zeroth law of thermodynamics establishes that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other, implying that at the same temperature, different materials may exhibit distinct expansions despite identical initial conditions.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Linear thermal expansion: $\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T$
- Difference in expansions between materials with different coefficients
- Absolute value calculation for magnitude differences

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Relates to heat transfer concepts in thermodynamics
- Connects to material-specific properties in solid-state physics
- Illustrates temperature dependence in physical systems

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Engineering: Critical in designing bimetallic strips (thermostats), bridges, and pipelines
- Materials Science: Determines compatibility of joined materials under thermal stress
- Geology: Explains rock fracturing during temperature cycles

Real-World Applications:

- Precision instruments (e.g., pendulum clocks) compensate for brass/iron expansion differences
- Spacecraft design accounts for thermal deformation in vacuum conditions

Problem:
A brass rod and an iron rod, each with an initial length $L_0 = 2.0  \text{m}$ at $0^\circ\text{C}$, are heated to $100^\circ\text{C}$. The coefficient of linear expansion for brass is $\alpha_b$ and for iron is $\alpha_i$, where $\alpha_b = 1.9 \times 10^{-5}  ^\circ\text{C}^{-1}$ and $\alpha_i = 1.2 \times 10^{-5}  ^\circ\text{C}^{-1}$. Calculate the absolute difference in the length expansions of the two rods. Express your answer in meters and provide the numerical value rounded to two significant figures.

## Solution
**Step 1: Expansion formula**  
The change in length for any rod is given by:  
$$\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T$$  
where:  
- $\alpha$ = coefficient of linear expansion ($^\circ\text{C}^{-1}$)  
- $L_0$ = initial length (m)  
- $\Delta T$ = temperature change ($^\circ\text{C}$)  

**Step 2: Calculate $\Delta T$**  
The temperature change is identical for both rods:  
$$\Delta T = 100^\circ\text{C} - 0^\circ\text{C} = 100  ^\circ\text{C}$$  

**Step 3: Expansion of brass rod**  
$$\Delta L_b = \alpha_b L_0 \Delta T = (1.9 \times 10^{-5}) \times 2.0 \times 100$$  

**Step 4: Expansion of iron rod**  
$$\Delta L_i = \alpha_i L_0 \Delta T = (1.2 \times 10^{-5}) \times 2.0 \times 100$$  

**Step 5: Difference in expansions**  
The absolute difference is:  
$$
\begin{align*}
\delta &= \left| \Delta L_b - \Delta L_i \right| \\
&= \left| (\alpha_b L_0 \Delta T) - (\alpha_i L_0 \Delta T) \right| \\
&= L_0 \Delta T \left| \alpha_b - \alpha_i \right|
\end{align*}
$$  

**Step 6: Substitute values**  
$$
\begin{align*}
\left| \alpha_b - \alpha_i \right| &= \left| 1.9 \times 10^{-5} - 1.2 \times 10^{-5} \right| = 0.7 \times 10^{-5} = 7.0 \times 10^{-6}  ^\circ\text{C}^{-1} \\
\delta &= (2.0) \times (100) \times (7.0 \times 10^{-6}) \\
&= 200 \times 7.0 \times 10^{-6} \\
&= 1.4 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m}
\end{align*}
$$  

**Step 7: Rounding**  
$1.4 \times 10^{-3}  \text{m}$ has two significant figures (as required).

## Problem 0
**Background: Capacitor Charging in a Defibrillator Circuit**

In emergency medical equipment like defibrillators, a capacitor stores electrical energy that is rapidly discharged through the patient's chest. The capacitor charges through a resistor from a high-voltage DC source. Consider such a circuit with a capacitor of capacitance $C$, a charging resistor $R$, and a source voltage $V_0$. The capacitor is initially uncharged ($v_C = 0$ at $t = 0$). When the charging process begins, the voltage $v_C(t)$ across the capacitor increases asymptotically toward $V_0$.

**Knowledge Points Tested**:
1. Modeling the transient response of an RC circuit using differential equations
2. Solving first-order differential equations with initial conditions
3. Exponential growth/decay in physical systems
4. Logarithmic solutions of exponential equations

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:
This problem connects to time-dependent phenomena in circuits (e.g., inductor-resistor systems), exponential decay in radioactive materials, and time-constant applications in analog electronics.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:
The exponential charging curve appears in biological systems (e.g., drug concentration in blood plasma), chemical reaction kinetics (first-order reactions), and thermodynamics (system relaxation times).

**Real-World Applications**:
RC timing circuits are used in pacemakers, camera flash units, electronic timers, and power supply stabilization. The specific case of charging to half-voltage determines circuit responsiveness in medical devices.

**Problem Statement**:

Derive the exact time $t_{1/2}$ required for the capacitor voltage $v_C(t)$ to reach $V_0/2$. Start from the circuit's governing differential equation and solve it analytically. Express your final answer symbolically in terms of $R$ and $C$, using the natural logarithm function $\ln$.

**Final Answer Format**:
Provide your answer as a symbolic expression using $R$, $C$, and mathematical functions. Use $\ln$ for natural logarithm (e.g., $\ln(2)$). Do not include numerical values or units.

## Solution
**Step 1: Establish the governing equation**  
Apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to the series RC circuit. At any time $t$:  
$$ V_0 = v_R(t) + v_C(t) $$  
By Ohm's law and capacitor current-voltage relationship:  
$$ v_R(t) = i(t)R, \quad i(t) = C \frac{dv_C}{dt} $$  
Substitute to obtain:  
$$ V_0 = RC \frac{dv_C}{dt} + v_C(t) $$  
Rearrange into standard first-order form:  
$$ \frac{dv_C}{dt} = \frac{V_0 - v_C}{RC} \quad \text{(Equation 1)} $$  

**Step 2: Solve the differential equation**  
Separate variables in Equation 1:  
$$ \frac{dv_C}{V_0 - v_C} = \frac{dt}{RC} $$  
Integrate both sides. Left side from $v_C = 0$ to $v_C(t)$, right side from $t = 0$ to $t$:  
$$ \int_0^{v_C(t)} \frac{dv_C}{V_0 - v_C} = \int_0^t \frac{dt}{RC} $$  
The left integral is solved via substitution $u = V_0 - v_C$, $du = -dv_C$:  
$$ -\int_{V_0}^{V_0 - v_C(t)} \frac{du}{u} = -\left[ \ln|u| \right]_{V_0}^{V_0 - v_C(t)} = -\ln\left(\frac{V_0 - v_C(t)}{V_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{V_0}{V_0 - v_C(t)}\right) $$  
The right integral evaluates to:  
$$ \frac{t}{RC} $$  
Thus:  
$$ \ln\left(\frac{V_0}{V_0 - v_C(t)}\right) = \frac{t}{RC} \quad \text{(Equation 2)} $$  

**Step 3: Solve for capacitor voltage**  
Exponentiate Equation 2:  
$$ \frac{V_0}{V_0 - v_C(t)} = e^{t/(RC)} $$  
Solve for $v_C(t)$:  
$$ V_0 = (V_0 - v_C(t)) e^{t/(RC)} $$  
$$ v_C(t) e^{t/(RC)} = V_0 e^{t/(RC)} - V_0 $$  
$$ v_C(t) = V_0 \left(1 - e^{-t/(RC)}\right) \quad \text{(Equation 3)} $$  

**Step 4: Find time for half-voltage**  
Set $v_C(t) = V_0/2$ in Equation 3:  
$$ \frac{V_0}{2} = V_0 \left(1 - e^{-t_{1/2}/(RC)}\right) $$  
Divide both sides by $V_0$:  
$$ \frac{1}{2} = 1 - e^{-t_{1/2}/(RC)} $$  
Solve for the exponential term:  
$$ e^{-t_{1/2}/(RC)} = \frac{1}{2} $$  
Take natural logarithm of both sides:  
$$ -\frac{t_{1/2}}{RC} = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\ln(2) $$  
Multiply both sides by $-RC$:  
$$ t_{1/2} = RC \ln(2) $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{RC\ln(2)}$$

## Problem 1
Background: Capacitors store electrical energy and release it over time when discharging through a resistive path. The time constant (τ) of an RC circuit quantitatively describes the discharge rate and is defined as the time required for the capacitor voltage to decay to 1/𝑒 (approximately 36.8%, often rounded to 37%) of its initial value. This problem explores a discharge circuit with a non-standard resistor network to deepen understanding of equivalent resistance modeling.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Exponential decay of capacitor voltage: $ V(t) = V_0 e^{-t/\tau} $.
2. Time constant definition: $ \tau = R_{\text{eq}} C $, where $ R_{\text{eq}} $ is the equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor.
3. Resistor network simplification (series/parallel combinations).

Intradisciplinary Connections: This integrates concepts from exponential functions (algebra), Kirchhoff's laws (DC circuits), and energy dissipation (electromagnetism). It reinforces how circuit topology affects dynamical behavior.

Interdisciplinary Connections: Exponential decay models appear in radioactive decay (physics), drug elimination (biology), and signal processing (engineering). Time constants are fundamental to timing circuits in real-world devices.

Real-World Applications: Discharge circuits with complex resistor networks are used in power electronics (e.g., snubber circuits to protect semiconductors), camera flash recycling systems, and defibrillator control circuits.

Problem:
A capacitor with capacitance $ C $ is initially charged to voltage $ V_0 $. It discharges through a resistor network comprising three resistors configured as follows between its terminals:
- Resistor $ R_1 $ is directly connected across the terminals.
- Resistor $ R_2 $ is in series with resistor $ R_3 $, and this series combination is also connected across the same terminals (parallel to $ R_1 $).
Determine the time constant $ \tau $ for this discharge circuit. The time constant is defined as the time at which the capacitor voltage drops to 37% of $ V_0 $.

Express $ \tau $ symbolically in terms of $ R_1 $, $ R_2 $, $ R_3 $, and $ C $.

## Solution
**Step 1: Model the equivalent resistance**  
The capacitor discharges through a network with two parallel branches:  
- Branch 1: Single resistor $ R_1 $.  
- Branch 2: Series combination of $ R_2 $ and $ R_3 $, with total resistance $ R_2 + R_3 $.  
The equivalent resistance $ R_{\text{eq}} $ of parallel resistors is:  
$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2 + R_3}.
$$  
Solving for $ R_{\text{eq}} $:  
$$
R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{R_1 (R_2 + R_3)}{R_1 + R_2 + R_3}.
$$  

**Step 2: Derive the time constant**  
The time constant $ \tau $ for any RC circuit is $ \tau = R_{\text{eq}} C $. Substituting the expression for $ R_{\text{eq}} $:  
$$
\tau = \left( \frac{R_1 (R_2 + R_3)}{R_1 + R_2 + R_3} \right) C.
$$  

**Step 3: Verify the 37% condition**  
The voltage during discharge follows $ V(t) = V_0 e^{-t/\tau} $. At $ t = \tau $:  
$$
V(\tau) = V_0 e^{-1} = \frac{V_0}{e} \approx 0.3679 V_0,
$$  
which is 36.79% of $ V_0 $ (consistent with the 37% approximation).

## Answer
$$
\boxed{\dfrac{ R_1 (R_2 + R_3) C }{ R_1 + R_2 + R_3 }}
$$

## Problem 2
**Background**  
In electronic circuits, capacitors store electrical energy and release it through resistors when discharging. This process is fundamental in applications like camera flashes, defibrillators, and timing circuits. The discharge follows an exponential decay characterized by the **time constant** $\tau = RC$, where $R$ is resistance and $C$ is capacitance. The energy dissipated in a resistor as heat during discharge is a key metric for circuit efficiency and safety.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Exponential decay of current in an RC circuit.  
2. Power dissipation in a resistor: $P(t) = I(t)^2 R$.  
3. Energy calculation via time integration: $E = \int P(t)  dt$.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects capacitor energy storage ($U = \frac{1}{2}CV^2$) to Joule heating in resistors, illustrating energy conservation in circuits. The exponential decay model also appears in radioactive decay and chemical kinetics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
In biology, similar exponential models describe drug elimination from the bloodstream. In environmental science, they model pollutant degradation.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Designing pacemaker circuits (controlled energy discharge) or photoflash systems (rapid energy release).  

**Problem Statement**  
A capacitor with capacitance $C$ is initially charged to voltage $V_0$. At $t = 0$, it begins discharging through a resistor of resistance $R$. Calculate the **total energy dissipated in the resistor** during the first time constant (i.e., from $t = 0$ to $t = \tau$, where $\tau = RC$).  

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $C$ and $V_0$ only. Use $\exp$ for the exponential function (e.g., $\exp(x)$ for $e^x$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Current during discharge**  
The current in an RC discharge circuit decays exponentially:  
$$ I(t) = \frac{V_0}{R} \exp\left(-\frac{t}{RC}\right) $$  

**Step 2: Power dissipation in resistor**  
Power dissipated is $P(t) = I(t)^2 R$. Substituting $I(t)$:  
$$ P(t) = \left[\frac{V_0}{R} \exp\left(-\frac{t}{RC}\right)\right]^2 R = \frac{V_0^2}{R} \exp\left(-\frac{2t}{RC}\right) $$  

**Step 3: Energy dissipated from $t=0$ to $t=\tau$**  
Energy $E$ is the integral of power over time:  
$$ E = \int_0^\tau P(t)  dt = \int_0^{RC} \frac{V_0^2}{R} \exp\left(-\frac{2t}{RC}\right)  dt $$  

**Step 4: Solve the integral**  
Let $u = -\frac{2t}{RC}$, so $du = -\frac{2}{RC}  dt$ or $dt = -\frac{RC}{2}  du$.  
- When $t = 0$, $u = 0$.  
- When $t = RC$, $u = -2$.  
Substitute:  
$$ E = \frac{V_0^2}{R} \int_0^{-2} \exp(u) \left(-\frac{RC}{2}\right)  du = \frac{V_0^2}{R} \cdot \left(-\frac{RC}{2}\right) \int_0^{-2} \exp(u)  du $$  
Simplify:  
$$ E = -\frac{V_0^2 C}{2} \int_0^{-2} \exp(u)  du $$  
Reverse integration limits to eliminate the negative sign:  
$$ E = \frac{V_0^2 C}{2} \int_{-2}^{0} \exp(u)  du $$  
Integrate $\exp(u)$:  
$$ E = \frac{V_0^2 C}{2} \left[ \exp(u) \right]_{-2}^{0} = \frac{V_0^2 C}{2} \left[ \exp(0) - \exp(-2) \right] $$  
Simplify:  
$$ E = \frac{V_0^2 C}{2} \left(1 - \exp(-2)\right) $$  

**Step 5: Express in required terms**  
The result is in terms of $C$ and $V_0$, as required.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{V_0^{2} C \left(1 - \exp\left(-2\right)\right)}{2}}$$

## Problem 3
### Background
In electronic circuits, capacitors store electrical energy and release it during discharge. When multiple capacitors are connected in parallel, their combined storage capacity increases. This configuration is common in applications like camera flashes, power supply filters, and defibrillators, where controlled energy release is critical. The discharge rate is characterized by a time constant ($\tau$), which determines how quickly the voltage decays to $1/e$ (about 37%) of its initial value. 

#### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**: Conservation of current at circuit nodes.
2. **Capacitor Discharge Dynamics**: Relationship $i_C = C \frac{dv}{dt}$ between capacitor current and voltage change.
3. **Equivalent Capacitance**: Total capacitance for parallel capacitors $C_{\text{eq}} = C_1 + C_2$.
4. **Time Constant Definition**: $\tau = RC$ for first-order RC circuits.
5. **Differential Equation Solution**: Exponential decay $v(t) \propto e^{-t/\tau}$.

#### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects capacitor combination rules (DC circuits) to transient response (time-domain analysis).
- Extends single-capacitor discharge theory to multi-capacitor systems.
- Reinforces exponential decay models in circuit theory.

#### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Physics**: Similar exponential decay appears in radioactive decay ($N = N_0 e^{-t/\lambda}$) and RC circuits share mathematical models with mechanical damping systems.
- **Biology**: Neuron membrane potential discharge follows RC-like dynamics.
- **Engineering**: Timing circuits in microcontrollers and pulse-width modulation rely on precise $\tau$ calculations.

#### Real-World Applications
- **Medical Devices**: Defibrillators use parallel capacitors for high-energy discharges with controlled $\tau$ to avoid tissue damage.
- **Renewable Energy**: Solar inverters use capacitor banks to smooth DC voltage; $\tau$ determines ripple magnitude.
- **Consumer Electronics**: Camera flash units optimize $\tau$ for rapid recycling and brightness control.

### Problem Statement
Two capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$ are connected in parallel. This combination discharges through a single resistor $R$. Initially, the capacitors are charged to voltage $V_0$. At time $t = 0$, the discharge begins.  

1. **Derive the differential equation** for the voltage $v(t)$ across the capacitors during discharge.  
2. **Solve the differential equation** to find $v(t)$ in terms of $V_0$, $t$, $R$, $C_1$, and $C_2$.  
3. **Identify the time constant $\tau$** from the solution.  

Express the equivalent time constant $\tau$ symbolically in terms of $R$, $C_1$, and $C_2$.

## Solution
### Step 1: Derive the Differential Equation
- Let $v(t)$ be the voltage across both capacitors (same voltage, since parallel).  
- The current through the resistor $i_R$ is given by Ohm's law:  
  $$
  i_R = \frac{v}{R}.
  $$  
- By KCL at the node connecting the capacitors and resistor, the total current leaving the capacitors equals $i_R$. For parallel capacitors, the total capacitor current $i_C$ is:  
  $$
  i_C = i_{C_1} + i_{C_2} = C_1 \frac{dv}{dt} + C_2 \frac{dv}{dt} = (C_1 + C_2) \frac{dv}{dt}.
  $$  
  *Note: The negative sign for discharge ($i_C = -i_R$) is implicit in the derivative direction.*  
- Equate $i_C$ and $-i_R$ (since current flows out of capacitors):  
  $$
  (C_1 + C_2) \frac{dv}{dt} = -\frac{v}{R}.
  $$  
- Rearrange to standard form:  
  $$
  \frac{dv}{dt} + \frac{v}{R(C_1 + C_2)} = 0.
  $$  

### Step 2: Solve the Differential Equation
- This is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation. Assume a solution $v(t) = A e^{-kt}$.  
- Substitute into the equation:  
  $$
  -kA e^{-kt} + \frac{A e^{-kt}}{R(C_1 + C_2)} = 0.
  $$  
- Factor out $A e^{-kt}$:  
  $$
  A e^{-kt} \left( -k + \frac{1}{R(C_1 + C_2)} \right) = 0.
  $$  
- Non-trivial solution requires:  
  $$
  k = \frac{1}{R(C_1 + C_2)}.
  $$  
- Thus, $v(t) = A e^{-t / [R(C_1 + C_2)]}$.  
- Apply initial condition $v(0) = V_0$:  
  $$
  v(0) = A e^{0} = A = V_0.
  $$  
- Final voltage expression:  
  $$
  v(t) = V_0  e^{-t / [R(C_1 + C_2)]}.
  $$  

### Step 3: Identify the Time Constant $\tau$
- The general form of exponential decay is $v(t) = V_0 e^{-t/\tau}$.  
- Comparing exponents:  
  $$
  \tau = R(C_1 + C_2).
  $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{R(C_1 + C_2)}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**  
Capacitors are fundamental components in electronic circuits, storing electrical energy and releasing it over time. In circuits with resistors, the charging and discharging of capacitors follow exponential patterns characterized by the time constant $\tau = RC$, where $R$ is resistance and $C$ is capacitance. This time constant governs how quickly a capacitor reaches its maximum charge during charging or loses charge during discharging.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Exponential decay in RC discharging circuits.  
- Application of logarithms to solve exponential equations.  
- Interpretation of the time constant $\tau$.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to the broader study of exponential processes in physics, such as radioactive decay and Newton's law of cooling, all governed by similar differential equations.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
In biomedical engineering, RC circuit principles model defibrillator behavior, where controlled capacitor discharge delivers life-saving shocks. In environmental science, similar exponential models predict pollutant dilution rates.  

**Real-World Applications**  
Camera flashes use RC circuits to time rapid capacitor discharge. Pacemakers rely on precise discharge intervals to regulate heartbeats. Understanding discharge timing is critical for designing these technologies.  

**Problem Statement**  
A capacitor $C$ is fully charged to $Q_{\text{max}}$ in an RC circuit with resistance $R$. At $t = 0$, the circuit is switched from charging to discharging. Derive the time $t$ required for the charge on $C$ to fall to $10\%$ of $Q_{\text{max}}$. Express your answer symbolically in terms of the time constant $\tau = RC$. Use the natural logarithm function, denoted as $\ln$, and ensure all exponents are formatted with a caret and braces (e.g., $e^{-t/\tau}$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Model discharging dynamics**  
During discharge, the charge $q(t)$ on the capacitor decays exponentially:  
$$ q(t) = Q_{\text{max}}  e^{-t / \tau}, $$  
where $\tau = RC$ is the time constant.  

**Step 2: Set up equation for target charge**  
We seek $t$ such that $q(t) = 0.10  Q_{\text{max}}$:  
$$ 0.10  Q_{\text{max}} = Q_{\text{max}}  e^{-t / \tau}. $$  

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for $t$**  
Divide both sides by $Q_{\text{max}}$ (assuming $Q_{\text{max}} \neq 0$):  
$$ 0.10 = e^{-t / \tau}. $$  
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:  
$$ \ln(0.10) = \ln\left(e^{-t / \tau}\right). $$  
Simplify using $\ln(e^x) = x$:  
$$ \ln(0.10) = -\frac{t}{\tau}. $$  
Solve for $t$:  
$$ t = -\tau  \ln(0.10). $$  

**Step 4: Simplify using logarithm properties**  
Recognize $0.10 = \frac{1}{10}$, so $\ln(0.10) = \ln\left(\frac{1}{10}\right) = \ln(1) - \ln(10) = -\ln(10)$:  
$$ t = -\tau  \left(-\ln(10)\right) = \tau  \ln(10). $$  
Thus, the time required is $\tau \ln(10)$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\tau \ln \left(10\right)}$$

## Problem 5
**Background**:  
In electronic circuits, the timing of events is often controlled by resistor-capacitor (RC) circuits. When a capacitor discharges through a resistor, its voltage decreases exponentially. The rate of decay depends on the time constant $\tau = RC$. This principle is critical in applications like camera flash recycling, defibrillator pulse timing, and electronic timers.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
- Exponential decay in RC circuits  
- Relationship between time constant and half-life  
- Natural logarithms and algebraic manipulation  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem connects to exponential decay in radioactive half-life (nuclear physics) and damping in mechanical oscillations.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
RC circuits are used in biomedical devices (e.g., pacemakers), photography (flash duration), and computer memory (refresh cycles).  

**Real-World Applications**:  
Defibrillators use RC circuits to deliver precisely timed electric shocks. Engineers select $R$ and $C$ values to control the discharge rate for medical safety.  

**Problem Statement**:  
A capacitor with capacitance $C$ is charged to an initial voltage $V_0$. At time $t = 0$, it begins discharging through a resistor of resistance $R$. The voltage across the capacitor drops to exactly $\frac{V_0}{2}$ at time $t = T$.  

Derive an expression for $R$ in terms of $C$ and $T$.  
Express your answer using only the symbols $C$ and $T$, along with standard mathematical functions. Use `\ln` for natural logarithm.

## Solution
The voltage $v(t)$ during discharge follows exponential decay:  
$$ v(t) = V_0 e^{-t/(RC)} $$  
At time $t = T$, the voltage is $\frac{V_0}{2}$:  
$$ \frac{V_0}{2} = V_0 e^{-T/(RC)} $$  
Divide both sides by $V_0$:  
$$ \frac{1}{2} = e^{-T/(RC)} $$  
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:  
$$ \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{T}{RC} $$  
Simplify $\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \ln(1) - \ln(2) = -\ln(2)$:  
$$ -\ln(2) = -\frac{T}{RC} $$  
Multiply both sides by $-1$:  
$$ \ln(2) = \frac{T}{RC} $$  
Solve for $R$:  
$$ R \cdot C \cdot \ln(2) = T $$  
$$ R = \frac{T}{C \ln(2)} $$  
The expression for $R$ is $\dfrac{T}{C \ln(2)}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{T}{C \ln(2)}}$$

Background:
Newton's law of universal gravitation describes the attractive force between two masses. This fundamental principle states that the gravitational force $F$ between two point masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r$ between them. The constant of proportionality is the universal gravitational constant $G$, expressed as:

$$ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$

Understanding units is essential for ensuring dimensional consistency in physical equations. The International System of Units (SI) defines base units for fundamental quantities: mass in kilograms (kg), length in meters (m), and time in seconds (s). Derived units, such as the newton (N) for force, are combinations of these base units. This problem explores how to derive the unit of $G$ using dimensional analysis, a method that examines the relationships between physical quantities through their units.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Dimensional analysis and unit derivation
- Newton's law of universal gravitation
- SI base units and their relationships

Intradisciplinary Connections:
Dimensional analysis connects to force derivation via Newton's second law ($F = ma$), which defines the newton as kg·m/s². It also applies to other inverse-square laws, such as Coulomb's law in electromagnetism, where similar unit derivations occur for constants like the Coulomb constant.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
In engineering, dimensional analysis ensures equations are dimensionally homogeneous for scale modeling (e.g., in fluid dynamics). In astronomy, consistent units are crucial for calculating orbital mechanics and gravitational interactions between celestial bodies.

Real-World Applications:
Accurate units for $G$ are vital for space mission trajectory calculations, gravitational wave detection (e.g., LIGO experiments), and geophysical surveys that measure density variations in Earth's crust. Industrial applications include precision gravity sensors used in oil exploration.

Problem:
Using Newton's law of universal gravitation, $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, derive the SI unit of $G$ in terms of the base SI units: kilograms (kg), meters (m), and seconds (s). Start from the SI unit of force and show all algebraic steps. 

**Final Answer Format**  
Express the unit as a single fraction using base units. Use explicit fractional notation: $\frac{\text{m}^a}{\text{kg}^b \cdot \text{s}^c}$ with integers $a$, $b$, $c$. Do not simplify to negative exponents.  
Example: For acceleration (m/s²), write $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify units from Newton's law**  
Newton's law is $ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $. Solving for $G$:  
$$ G = \frac{F \cdot r^2}{m_1 m_2} $$  

**Step 2: Substitute SI units**  
- Force $F$ has the derived unit newton (N). From Newton's second law ($F = ma$), 1 N = 1 kg·m/s².  
- Distance $r$ has the base unit meter (m).  
- Masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ have the base unit kilogram (kg).  
Substitute these units into the equation for $G$:  
$$ \text{Unit of } G = \frac{ (\text{kg} \cdot \text{m} / \text{s}^2) \cdot (\text{m})^2 }{ \text{kg} \cdot \text{kg} } $$  

**Step 3: Simplify the expression**  
- Numerator: $ (\text{kg} \cdot \text{m} / \text{s}^2) \cdot \text{m}^2 = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^3 / \text{s}^2 $  
- Denominator: $ \text{kg} \cdot \text{kg} = \text{kg}^2 $  
Combine:  
$$ \text{Unit of } G = \frac{ \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^3 / \text{s}^2 }{ \text{kg}^2 } = \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^2} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The SI unit of the universal gravitational constant $G$ is $\frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^2}$. This unit ensures dimensional consistency in Newton's law, as force (kg·m/s²) must equal $G$ multiplied by (kg²/m²), yielding consistent units on both sides.

## Problem 1
**Background:**  
In physics, dimensional analysis ensures equations accurately represent physical relationships by verifying that both sides share identical dimensions. Dimensions are expressed in fundamental quantities: mass (M), length (L), and time (T). Kinetic energy (KE) quantifies the energy of motion. The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy. Work is defined as force multiplied by displacement, and force is mass multiplied by acceleration.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Fundamental dimensions (M, L, T).  
- Dimensional analysis for consistency verification.  
- Derivation of derived dimensions from first principles.  
- Application to energy equations.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
Connects to Newtonian mechanics (work, force, acceleration) and energy conservation. Reinforces the importance of dimensional homogeneity in physical equations.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Essential in engineering (e.g., structural analysis) and chemistry (reaction kinetics) for validating equations and scaling experiments.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Used to check equations in aerospace engineering (e.g., rocket propulsion models) and biomechanics (e.g., energy expenditure in motion).  

**Problem Statement:**  
A student proposes the kinetic energy equation $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $m$ is mass and $v$ is velocity. Verify its dimensional consistency by:  
1. Deriving the dimensions of kinetic energy from the definition of work ($W = F \cdot d$), force ($F = m a$), and acceleration ($a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$).  
2. Determining the dimensions of the right-hand side ($\frac{1}{2}mv^2$).  
3. Concluding if the equation is dimensionally consistent.  

**Final Answer Requirement:**  
Express the dimensions of kinetic energy as a product of powers of M, L, and T in the form $M^a L^b T^c$. Replace $a$, $b$, and $c$ with the appropriate integers.

## Solution
**Step 1: Derive dimensions of kinetic energy from work and force definitions.**  
- Work $W$ is force $F$ multiplied by displacement $d$:  
  $$[W] = [F] \cdot [d]$$  
- Displacement $d$ has dimensions of length: $[d] = L$.  
- Force $F$ is mass $m$ multiplied by acceleration $a$:  
  $$[F] = [m] \cdot [a] = M \cdot [a]$$  
- Acceleration $a$ is change in velocity per unit time:  
  $$[a] = \frac{[\Delta v]}{[\Delta t]} = \frac{\text{dimensions of velocity}}{\text{dimensions of time}}$$  
- Velocity $v$ has dimensions of length per time: $[v] = L T^{-1}$. Thus:  
  $$[a] = \frac{L T^{-1}}{T} = L T^{-2}$$  
- Substitute $[a]$ into $[F]$:  
  $$[F] = M \cdot (L T^{-2}) = M L T^{-2}$$  
- Now, $[W] = [F] \cdot [d] = (M L T^{-2}) \cdot L = M L^2 T^{-2}$.  
- Since kinetic energy $KE$ has the same dimensions as work $W$:  
  $$[KE] = M L^2 T^{-2}$$  

**Step 2: Determine dimensions of $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$.**  
- The constant $\frac{1}{2}$ is dimensionless, so it does not contribute to dimensions.  
- Mass $m$ has dimensions $[m] = M$.  
- Velocity $v$ has dimensions $[v] = L T^{-1}$, so:  
  $$[v^2] = (L T^{-1})^2 = L^2 T^{-2}$$  
- Combine dimensions:  
  $$\left[\frac{1}{2}mv^2\right] = [m] \cdot [v^2] = M \cdot (L^2 T^{-2}) = M L^2 T^{-2}$$  

**Step 3: Verify dimensional consistency.**  
- Left-hand side dimensions: $[KE] = M L^2 T^{-2}$.  
- Right-hand side dimensions: $\left[\frac{1}{2}mv^2\right] = M L^2 T^{-2}$.  
Both sides have identical dimensions $M L^2 T^{-2}$. Thus, the equation $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ is dimensionally consistent.  

**Final expression for dimensions of KE:**  
$$[KE] = M^1 L^2 T^{-2}$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{M^{1}L^{2}T^{-2}}$$

## Problem 2
**Background**  
In physics, dimensional analysis is a crucial tool for verifying equations and deriving units of unknown quantities. Consider the mass-spring system, which exhibits simple harmonic motion. The period of oscillation, $T$, depends on the mass $m$ attached to the spring and the spring constant $k$, which quantifies the spring's stiffness. The formula $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$ relates these variables. Here, $T$ is measured in seconds (s), and $m$ is measured in kilograms (kg). For this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the units of $k$ must align with the units of the other quantities through algebraic manipulation.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Unit consistency and dimensional analysis.  
- Algebraic manipulation of units in physical equations.  
- Deriving units of derived physical quantities from fundamental units.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to mechanics (oscillations), dynamics (Hooke's Law: $F = -kx$), and wave physics (period-frequency relationships). It reinforces how unit analysis underpins equation validation across physics subfields.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Dimensional analysis is vital in engineering (e.g., verifying stress-strain relationships), chemistry (reaction rate units), and economics (dimensional homogeneity in models).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Determining the correct units of $k$ ensures accurate spring design in automotive suspensions, medical devices (e.g., prosthetics), and timekeeping mechanisms (mechanical watches).  

**Problem**  
Using the period formula $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$, where $T$ is in seconds (s) and $m$ is in kilograms (kg), derive the unit of the spring constant $k$ in terms of the base SI units kilograms and seconds. Express your final answer in the form $\text{kg}^a \cdot \text{s}^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Use the notation $\text{kg}$ for kilograms and $\text{s}$ for seconds, with $\cdot$ for multiplication.

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify the units of given quantities**  
- $T$ (period) has units of seconds: $[T] = \text{s}$.  
- $m$ (mass) has units of kilograms: $[m] = \text{kg}$.  
- $2\pi$ is dimensionless (no units).  

**Step 2: Analyze the units of the expression under the square root**  
The formula is $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$. Since $2\pi$ has no units, the units of $T$ must equal the units of $\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$:  
$$  
[\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}] = [T] = \text{s}.  
$$  

**Step 3: Square both sides to eliminate the square root**  
Squaring both sides gives:  
$$  
\left[\frac{m}{k}\right] = [T]^2 = \text{s}^2.  
$$  

**Step 4: Substitute the unit of mass**  
Since $[m] = \text{kg}$, substitute into the equation:  
$$  
\frac{\text{kg}}{[k]} = \text{s}^2,  
$$  
where $[k]$ is the unit of $k$.  

**Step 5: Solve for the unit of $k$**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $[k]$:  
$$  
[k] = \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}^2} = \text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}.  
$$  

**Conclusion**  
The unit of the spring constant $k$ is $\text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$, which corresponds to $a = 1$ and $b = -2$ in the form $\text{kg}^a \cdot \text{s}^b$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}}$$

## Problem 3
Background:
In fluid mechanics, the pressure at a depth $h$ in a static fluid is given by $P = \rho g h$, where $P$ is pressure, $\rho$ is fluid density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, and $h$ is depth. This equation is foundational in designing hydraulic systems, submarines, and dams. Dimensional analysis ensures equations are physically meaningful by verifying unit consistency across terms. Here, we focus on deriving $g$'s units when pressure is given in pascals (Pa), revealing how fundamental units interconnect in physical laws.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Dimensional consistency of equations
- SI base units (kg, m, s) and derived units (Pa)
- Unit algebra and exponent manipulation

Intradisciplinary Connections:
Connects to Newton's second law (force derivation) and fluid statics principles. Extends to stress-strain relationships in materials science.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Relevant to engineering (pressure vessel design), geophysics (earth's core pressure modeling), and meteorology (atmospheric pressure gradients).

Real-World Applications:
Calibrating pressure sensors in submarines, determining blood pressure in medical devices, and calculating structural loads in dam engineering.

Problem Statement:
Consider the pressure-depth relationship $P = \rho g h$.  
- Pressure $P$ is given in pascals (Pa).  
- Density $\rho$ is in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³).  
- Depth $h$ is in meters (m).  

Verify the dimensional consistency of this equation and derive the units of gravitational acceleration $g$ explicitly in terms of SI base units (kg, m, s). Express the units as a product of powers: $\text{kg}^a \text{m}^b \text{s}^c$ (e.g., $\text{m/s}^2$ becomes $\text{m}^1 \text{s}^{-2}$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Express all quantities in base SI units.**  
- Pascal (Pa) is a derived unit: $1  \text{Pa} = 1  \text{N/m}^2$ and $1  \text{N} = 1  \text{kg·m/s}^2$, so:  
  
$$
  [P] = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}
  $$
  
- Density $\rho$:  
  
$$
  [\rho] = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-3}
  $$
  
- Depth $h$:  
  
$$
  [h] = \text{m}
  $$
  

**Step 2: Apply dimensional consistency to $P = \rho g h$.**  
The equation must have identical units on both sides:  

$$
[P] = [\rho] \cdot [g] \cdot [h]
$$
  
Substitute the base units:  

$$
\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2} = (\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-3}) \cdot [g] \cdot (\text{m})
$$
  

**Step 3: Simplify the right-hand side.**  
Combine units for $\rho$ and $h$:  

$$
\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-3} \cdot \text{m} = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-2}
$$
  
So the equation becomes:  

$$
\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2} = (\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-2}) \cdot [g]
$$
  

**Step 4: Solve for $[g]$.**  
Isolate $[g]$:  

$$
[g] = \frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-2}} = \frac{\text{m}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}}{\text{m}^{-2}}
$$
  
Simplify exponents:  

$$
[g] = \text{m}^{-1 - (-2)} \cdot \text{s}^{-2} = \text{m}^{1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}
$$
  
(Note: $\text{kg}^{1-1} = \text{kg}^0 = 1$, so kg vanishes.)  

**Step 5: Verify consistency.**  
Left side: $[P] = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$  
Right side: $[\rho][g][h] = (\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-3}) \cdot (\text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}) \cdot (\text{m}) = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$  
Both sides match, confirming dimensional consistency.  

**Conclusion:**  
The units of $g$ are $\text{m}^{1} \text{s}^{-2}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\text{m}^{1} \text{s}^{-2}}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**

In electromagnetism, the force on a moving charged particle in a magnetic field is described by the Lorentz force law. This fundamental principle states that the magnetic component of the force depends on the particle's charge, velocity, and the strength of the magnetic field, along with the angle between the velocity and field vectors. Understanding how to derive the unit of magnetic field strength from this law demonstrates the power of dimensional analysis—a core technique for verifying equations and connecting physical concepts across disciplines.

**Knowledge Points Tested**
- Unit derivation from physical equations
- Dimensional consistency analysis
- SI base unit relationships
- Algebraic manipulation of units

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
This problem links electromagnetism (Lorentz force) to classical mechanics (force units) and foundational mathematics (unit algebra). It reinforces how derived units like newtons (N) and coulombs (C) decompose into base units.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
Dimensional analysis is critical in engineering (system design), chemistry (reaction kinetics), and computer science (algorithmic unit validation). It ensures equations model real-world phenomena consistently.

**Real-World Applications**
Magnetic field units are essential in designing electric motors, MRI machines, particle accelerators, and compass navigation systems. Precise unit knowledge prevents errors in calibrating sensors or interpreting experimental data.

**Problem Statement**
Using the magnetic force equation $F = qvB \sin\theta$, where:  
- $F$ is force in newtons (N),  
- $q$ is charge in coulombs (C),  
- $v$ is velocity in meters per second (m/s),  
- $\theta$ is a dimensionless angle,  
derive the SI base unit of magnetic field strength $B$.  

Express the unit as a product of powers of the base SI units: kilograms (kg), seconds (s), and amperes (A). Recall that $1\ \text{C} = 1\ \text{A} \cdot \text{s}$ and $1\ \text{N} = 1\ \text{kg} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$.  

*Format requirements*:  
- Write the unit as a single fraction with positive exponents in the denominator.  
- Use the notation $\frac{\text{kg}^a \cdot \text{s}^b \cdot \text{A}^c}{\text{kg}^d \cdot \text{s}^e \cdot \text{A}^f}$ or equivalent compact form.  
- Do not include meters (m) in the final expression.

## Solution
**Step 1: Solve for B**  
Rearrange the equation $F = qvB \sin\theta$ to isolate $B$:  

$$
B = \frac{F}{qv \sin\theta}
$$


**Step 2: Identify unit relationships**  
Since $\sin\theta$ is dimensionless, the unit of $B$ is:  

$$
[B] = \frac{[F]}{[q] \cdot [v]}
$$

Substitute given units:  
- $[F] = \text{N} = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$  
- $[q] = \text{C} = \text{A} \cdot \text{s}$ (from definition)  
- $[v] = \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$  

**Step 3: Substitute units into the equation**  

$$
[B] = \frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}}{(\text{A} \cdot \text{s}) \cdot (\text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1})}
$$


**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
Combine terms in the denominator:  

$$
(\text{A} \cdot \text{s}) \cdot (\text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}) = \text{A} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{1-1} = \text{A} \cdot \text{m}
$$

Now the expression is:  

$$
[B] = \frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}}{\text{A} \cdot \text{m}}
$$

Cancel meters (m) in numerator and denominator:  

$$
[B] = \frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}}{\text{A}}
$$


**Step 5: Rewrite using positive exponents**  
Express with positive exponents in the denominator:  

$$
[B] = \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}^2 \cdot \text{A}}
$$


**Conclusion**  
The SI base unit of magnetic field $B$ is $\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{s}^2 \cdot \text{A}}$. This matches the tesla (T), the standard unit for magnetic field strength.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{s}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{A}}}$$

## Problem 5
**Background**

In physics, the speed of a wave traveling along a string depends on the tension in the string and its linear density. This relationship is described by the wave speed equation $v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$, where $T$ represents tension and $\mu$ represents linear density. Understanding how to derive the units of physical quantities from equations is essential for ensuring dimensional consistency—a fundamental principle that verifies whether equations make physical sense. This skill bridges theoretical physics and real-world applications, such as designing musical instruments (e.g., guitars) or analyzing seismic waves in engineering.

**Knowledge Points Tested**
- Unit analysis and dimensional consistency.
- Manipulation of derived units (e.g., newtons) into base SI units.
- Application of exponent rules in unit simplification.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
- Connects to mechanics (force, mass, motion) and wave physics.
- Reinforces algebraic manipulation skills used in kinematics and dynamics.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
- Engineering: Essential for verifying equations in structural analysis and acoustics.
- Mathematics: Demonstrates practical application of exponent rules and roots.

**Real-World Applications**
- Tuning string instruments: Musicians adjust tension ($T$) to achieve desired wave speeds (affecting pitch).
- Civil engineering: Calculating wave speeds in cables for suspension bridges or elevators.

**Problem**

Using the wave speed equation $v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$, derive the SI unit of $v$ when tension $T$ is given in newtons (N) and linear density $\mu$ is given in kilograms per meter (kg/m). Express the unit as a product of powers of the base SI units: kilograms (kg), meters (m), and seconds (s). Use the form $\text{kg}^a \cdot \text{m}^b \cdot \text{s}^c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers. 

**Final Answer Format**
- Provide the unit in the exact form $\text{kg}^a \cdot \text{m}^b \cdot \text{s}^c$ with the specific integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ substituted. Do not simplify or omit zero exponents.

## Solution
**Step 1: Break down the units of tension ($T$) and linear density ($\mu$).**  
- Tension $T$ is in newtons (N). Since $1  \text{N} = 1  \text{kg} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$, the unit of $T$ is:  
  $$\text{kg} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$$  
- Linear density $\mu$ is in kg/m, which is equivalent to:  
  $$\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-1}$$  

**Step 2: Determine the units of the ratio $\frac{T}{\mu}$.**  
Divide the unit of $T$ by the unit of $\mu$:  
$$
\text{Unit of } \frac{T}{\mu} = \frac{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-1}} = \text{kg}^{1-1} \cdot \text{m}^{1-(-1)} \cdot \text{s}^{-2} = \text{kg}^{0} \cdot \text{m}^{2} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}
$$  
Simplification:  
- $\text{kg}$: Exponent $1 - 1 = 0$.  
- $\text{m}$: Exponent $1 - (-1) = 2$.  
- $\text{s}$: Exponent $-2$ remains unchanged.  

**Step 3: Determine the units of $v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$.**  
Take the square root of the unit of $\frac{T}{\mu}$:  
$$
\text{Unit of } v = \sqrt{\text{kg}^{0} \cdot \text{m}^{2} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}} = \left( \text{kg}^{0} \cdot \text{m}^{2} \cdot \text{s}^{-2} \right)^{1/2}
$$  
Apply the exponent rule $(x^p)^q = x^{p \cdot q}$ to each base unit:  
- $\text{kg}$: $0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0$ → $\text{kg}^0$  
- $\text{m}$: $2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1$ → $\text{m}^1$  
- $\text{s}$: $-2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -1$ → $\text{s}^{-1}$  

Thus, the unit of $v$ is:  
$$\text{kg}^0 \cdot \text{m}^1 \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\text{kg}^{0} \cdot \text{m}^{1} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}}$$

## Problem 6
Background:
Capacitors are fundamental components in electrical circuits that store energy in an electric field. The energy $U$ stored in a capacitor is given by the formula $U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2$, where $C$ is the capacitance and $V$ is the voltage. Dimensional analysis ensures equations are physically meaningful by verifying that all terms have consistent units. The joule (J) is the SI unit of energy, defined as $1 \, \text{J} = 1 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$. 

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Dimensional consistency of physical equations
- Derivation of units from fundamental principles
- Relationship between electrical and mechanical quantities

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects electromagnetism (capacitance, voltage) with classical mechanics (energy units) through dimensional analysis, highlighting how physical laws unify different domains.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Dimensional analysis is critical in engineering for unit conversions, in physics for verifying equations, and in chemistry for stoichiometric calculations involving energy.

Real-World Applications:
Understanding capacitance units is essential for designing energy storage systems (e.g., camera flashes, defibrillators) and optimizing electronic circuits (e.g., filters, oscillators).

Your task:
1. Verify the dimensional consistency of $U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2$ by showing both sides have identical dimensions.
2. Derive the unit of capacitance $C$ in base SI units (kg, m, s, A) when $U$ is in joules.  
Express the unit as $\text{kg}^a \cdot \text{m}^b \cdot \text{s}^c \cdot \text{A}^d$ and provide the exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$.  
Ignore the dimensionless constant $\frac{1}{2}$ in your analysis.

## Solution
**Step 1: Verify dimensional consistency**  
The left side is energy, so its dimension is:  
$$[U] = \text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-2}$$  
where M = mass, L = length, T = time.  

The right side is $C V^2$. Voltage $V$ is energy per unit charge:  
$$[V] = \frac{[U]}{[Q]} = \frac{\text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-2}}{\text{I} \text{T}} = \text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-3} \text{I}^{-1}$$  
(charge $[Q] = \text{I} \text{T}$, and I = current).  

Thus, $[V]^2 = (\text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-3} \text{I}^{-1})^2 = \text{M}^2 \text{L}^4 \text{T}^{-6} \text{I}^{-2}$.  

The dimension of $C V^2$ is:  
$$[C] \cdot [V]^2 = [C] \cdot \text{M}^2 \text{L}^4 \text{T}^{-6} \text{I}^{-2}$$  

For consistency with $[U]$:  
$$\text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-2} = [C] \cdot \text{M}^2 \text{L}^4 \text{T}^{-6} \text{I}^{-2}$$  
Solve for $[C]$:  
$$[C] = \frac{\text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-2}}{\text{M}^2 \text{L}^4 \text{T}^{-6} \text{I}^{-2}} = \text{M}^{1-2} \text{L}^{2-4} \text{T}^{-2-(-6)} \text{I}^{0-(-2)} = \text{M}^{-1} \text{L}^{-2} \text{T}^{4} \text{I}^{2}$$  

The formula is dimensionally consistent because $[C V^2] = [C][V]^2 = (\text{M}^{-1} \text{L}^{-2} \text{T}^{4} \text{I}^{2}) \cdot (\text{M}^2 \text{L}^4 \text{T}^{-6} \text{I}^{-2}) = \text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-2} = [U]$.

**Step 2: Derive unit of capacitance**  
From $[C] = \text{M}^{-1} \text{L}^{-2} \text{T}^{4} \text{I}^{2}$, substitute base SI units:  
- M → kg  
- L → m  
- T → s  
- I → A  

The unit of $C$ is:  
$$\text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot \text{s}^{4} \cdot \text{A}^{2}$$  
Thus, the exponents are $a = -1$, $b = -2$, $c = 4$, $d = 2$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\text{kg}^{-1} \text{m}^{-2} \text{s}^{4} \text{A}^{2}}$$

# unit vectors and vector notation

## Problem 0
Background:
In physics and engineering, unit vectors are essential for representing directions without magnitude. They are vectors of length 1 that preserve the direction of a given vector. For example, in robotics, unit vectors define movement axes; in aerodynamics, they model wind direction. Here, we explore a vector in the xy-plane: $\vec{A} = 3\hat{i} - 4\hat{j}$. This could represent a displacement (e.g., 3 units east, 4 units south) or a force component.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Definition and properties of unit vectors
- Magnitude calculation for 2D vectors
- Vector normalization (scaling to unit length)

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects to vector operations (addition, scalar multiplication) and coordinate geometry.
- Relates to trigonometric identities through direction angles (e.g., $\theta = \arctan(A_y/A_x)$).

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Physics: Used in force decomposition and kinematics.
- Computer Graphics: Normalizing surface normals for lighting calculations.
- Navigation: Waypoint direction vectors in GPS systems.

Real-World Applications:
- Drone navigation: Unit vectors guide flight paths.
- Structural engineering: Decomposing loads into directional components.
- Game development: Character movement direction normalization.

Problem:
Given $\vec{A} = 3\hat{i} - 4\hat{j}$, derive the unit vector $\hat{A}$ in the direction of $\vec{A}$. Express $\hat{A}$ in component form as $a\hat{i} + b\hat{j}$, where $a$ and $b$ are simplified fractions. Show that the magnitude of $\hat{A}$ is exactly 1.  
**Final Answer Format:**  
Provide $\hat{A}$ as $a\hat{i} + b\hat{j}$.  
Example: If $\hat{A} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{i} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{j}$, submit $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{i} + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{j}$.  
Use $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ notation only.

## Solution
**Step 1: Magnitude of $\vec{A}$**  
The magnitude $|\vec{A}|$ is calculated as:  
$$ |\vec{A}| = \sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 $$  

**Step 2: Unit vector formula**  
The unit vector $\hat{A}$ is:  
$$ \hat{A} = \frac{\vec{A}}{|\vec{A}|} = \frac{3\hat{i} - 4\hat{j}}{5} $$  

**Step 3: Component extraction**  
Separate into $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ components:  
$$ \hat{A} = \frac{3}{5}\hat{i} - \frac{4}{5}\hat{j} $$  

**Step 4: Magnitude verification**  
Confirm $|\hat{A}| = 1$:  
$$ |\hat{A}| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{4}{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{25} + \frac{16}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{25}} = \sqrt{1} = 1 $$  
The magnitude is 1, as required for a unit vector.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{3}{5}\hat{i} - \dfrac{4}{5}\hat{j}}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
In physics and engineering, unit vectors are essential for representing directions without magnitude. For instance, in navigation systems for drones or spacecraft, unit vectors describe the orientation of thrusters or antennas. Consider a scenario where a satellite's thruster exerts a force given by the vector $\vec{B} = 2\hat{i} + 6\hat{j} - 3\hat{k}$ in a Cartesian coordinate system. To align the satellite's communication antenna with the thrust direction, engineers need the unit vector parallel to $\vec{B}$.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Vector magnitude calculation in three dimensions.
2. Definition and computation of unit vectors.
3. Vector scalar multiplication.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects to vector decomposition, dot products (for projections), and cross products (for orthogonal vectors) within linear algebra. It also relates to kinematics, where unit vectors define velocity or force directions.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- **Computer Graphics**: Unit vectors model light-ray directions for shading calculations.
- **Robotics**: Unit vectors describe joint orientations and end-effector paths.
- **Geophysics**: Unit vectors represent seismic wave propagation directions.

Real-World Applications:
- **Aerospace Engineering**: Calculating thrust vector directions for rocket trajectory control.
- **Virtual Reality**: Normalizing head-tracking data to determine user orientation.
- **Structural Analysis**: Decomposing forces into directional components for stress calculations.

Problem:
Given $\vec{B} = 2\hat{i} + 6\hat{j} - 3\hat{k}$, derive the unit vector $\hat{u}$ parallel to $\vec{B}$. Express $\hat{u}$ in the form $a\hat{i} + b\hat{j} + c\hat{k}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are simplified fractions (in lowest terms) with positive denominators. If a component is negative, place the negative sign in the numerator. Show all steps explicitly.

Final Answer Format:
Provide $\hat{u}$ as a single vector expression: $\boxed{a\hat{i} + b\hat{j} + c\hat{k}}$. Use fractions reduced to lowest terms (e.g., $-\frac{3}{7}$, not $\frac{-3}{7}$ or $\frac{6}{-14}$). Do not evaluate numerically.

## Solution
The unit vector $\hat{u}$ parallel to $\vec{B}$ is defined as:
$$ \hat{u} = \frac{\vec{B}}{||\vec{B}||} $$
where $||\vec{B}||$ is the magnitude of $\vec{B}$.

First, compute $||\vec{B}||$:
$$ ||\vec{B}|| = \sqrt{(2)^2 + (6)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 36 + 9} = \sqrt{49} = 7 $$

Now, divide each component of $\vec{B}$ by $||\vec{B}|| = 7$:
$$ a = \frac{2}{7}, \quad b = \frac{6}{7}, \quad c = \frac{-3}{7} = -\frac{3}{7} $$

Verify the fractions are in lowest terms:
- $\frac{2}{7}$: 2 and 7 are coprime.
- $\frac{6}{7}$: 6 and 7 are coprime.
- $-\frac{3}{7}$: 3 and 7 are coprime.

Thus, the unit vector is:
$$ \hat{u} = \frac{2}{7}\hat{i} + \frac{6}{7}\hat{j} - \frac{3}{7}\hat{k} $$

Confirm the magnitude of $\hat{u}$ is 1:
$$ ||\hat{u}|| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2}{7}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{6}{7}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{3}{7}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{49} + \frac{36}{49} + \frac{9}{49}} = \sqrt{\frac{49}{49}} = \sqrt{1} = 1 $$
This confirms $\hat{u}$ is a unit vector parallel to $\vec{B}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{2}{7}\hat{i} + \dfrac{6}{7}\hat{j} - \dfrac{3}{7}\hat{k}}$$

## Problem 2
Background: In physics and engineering, vectors are fundamental for describing quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Unit vectors, which have a magnitude of exactly 1, are essential for specifying directions without scaling effects. For example, in navigation systems, unit vectors define headings for aircraft or autonomous vehicles. In this problem, we explore how to compute a unit vector from vector addition.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Vector addition in Cartesian coordinates.
2. Magnitude calculation of a vector.
3. Unit vector derivation by normalization (dividing a vector by its magnitude).
4. Simplification of radical expressions and rationalization of denominators.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
- Connects to kinematics (displacement vectors) and force analysis in physics.
- Extends to vector decomposition in multivariable calculus.
- Relates to directional derivatives and gradients in advanced vector calculus.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- Robotics: Used to program directional movement of robotic arms.
- Computer Graphics: Essential for lighting calculations and surface normal orientation.
- Geophysics: Applied in interpreting seismic wave propagation directions.

Real-World Applications:
- Autonomous Drones: Calculating the direction of net displacement after multiple movements.
- Game Development: Normalizing velocity vectors for consistent character movement speeds.
- Structural Engineering: Determining the direction of resultant forces on a beam.

Problem Statement:
A small drone moves in a plane with two consecutive displacements. The first displacement is given by the vector $\vec{C} = 5\hat{i} - \hat{j}$ (in meters), and the second by $\vec{D} = -\hat{i} + 7\hat{j}$ (in meters). Determine the unit vector in the direction of the drone's net displacement $\vec{C} + \vec{D}$. Express your answer in the form $a \hat{i} + b \hat{j}$, where $a$ and $b$ are exact simplified expressions with rationalized denominators. Use $\hat{i}$ for the x-direction unit vector and $\hat{j}$ for the y-direction unit vector.

## Solution
**Step 1: Compute the net displacement vector $\vec{S}$**  

$$
\vec{S} = \vec{C} + \vec{D} = (5\hat{i} - \hat{j}) + (-\hat{i} + 7\hat{j}) = (5 - 1)\hat{i} + (-1 + 7)\hat{j} = 4\hat{i} + 6\hat{j}.
$$


**Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of $\vec{S}$**  
The magnitude $|\vec{S}|$ is given by:

$$
|\vec{S}| = \sqrt{(4)^2 + (6)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{52}.
$$

Simplify $\sqrt{52}$:

$$
\sqrt{52} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 13} = 2\sqrt{13}.
$$


**Step 3: Derive the unit vector**  
The unit vector $\hat{u}$ in the direction of $\vec{S}$ is:

$$
\hat{u} = \frac{\vec{S}}{|\vec{S}|} = \frac{4\hat{i} + 6\hat{j}}{2\sqrt{13}} = \frac{4}{2\sqrt{13}} \hat{i} + \frac{6}{2\sqrt{13}} \hat{j} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{13}} \hat{i} + \frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} \hat{j}.
$$


**Step 4: Rationalize the denominators**  
Rationalize each component:

$$
\frac{2}{\sqrt{13}} = \frac{2 \sqrt{13}}{13}, \quad \frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} = \frac{3 \sqrt{13}}{13}.
$$

Thus, the unit vector is:

$$
\hat{u} = \frac{2\sqrt{13}}{13} \hat{i} + \frac{3\sqrt{13}}{13} \hat{j}.
$$


**Verification**  
- Magnitude of $\hat{u}$:  
  
$$
  \sqrt{\left( \frac{2\sqrt{13}}{13} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{13}}{13} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4 \cdot 13}{169} + \frac{9 \cdot 13}{169}} = \sqrt{\frac{52 + 117}{169}} = \sqrt{\frac{169}{169}} = \sqrt{1} = 1.
  $$

  The magnitude is 1, confirming it is a unit vector.

## Answer
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{2\sqrt{13}}{13} \hat{\imath} + \dfrac{3\sqrt{13}}{13} \hat{\jmath}}
\]

## Problem 3
Background: In a 3D Cartesian coordinate system used for drone navigation, the position of a drone is tracked relative to a control tower (origin). The drone first flies horizontally east (positive x-direction) for 10 meters to inspect a solar panel, then descends vertically 24 meters (negative z-direction) to examine a ground sensor. The y-axis points north, but no motion occurs in this direction. The total displacement vector from origin to final position is given as $\vec{r} = (10  \text{m})\hat{\imath} - (24  \text{m})\hat{k}$.

Knowledge Points Tested:
- Vector decomposition in 3D Cartesian coordinates
- Magnitude calculation of a vector
- Unit vector definition and computation

Intradisciplinary Connections: This problem connects vector operations to kinematics, where displacement vectors describe changes in position. Unit vectors are foundational for representing directions in force analysis, electromagnetic fields, and velocity vectors in physics.

Interdisciplinary Connections: Unit vectors are essential in computer graphics for light direction calculations, robotics for path planning, and geology for representing fault plane orientations.

Real-World Applications: Unit vectors enable precise direction control in autonomous drones for package delivery, directional antenna alignment in telecommunications, and normalized data processing in machine learning algorithms for spatial recognition.

Problem: Derive the unit vector in the direction of $\vec{r}$. Express your answer as a vector expression in simplified fractional form, writing only non-zero components. Use $\hat{\imath}$ and $\hat{k}$ for unit vectors.

## Solution
The unit vector $\hat{u}$ in the direction of $\vec{r}$ is defined as:
$$ \hat{u} = \frac{\vec{r}}{|\vec{r}|} $$
where $|\vec{r}|$ is the magnitude of $\vec{r}$.

Given displacement vector:
$$ \vec{r} = 10\hat{\imath} - 24\hat{k}  \text{(in meters)} $$

Calculate the magnitude $|\vec{r}|$:
$$ 
|\vec{r}| = \sqrt{(10)^2 + (0)^2 + (-24)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 0 + 576} = \sqrt{676}
$$
Since $\sqrt{676} = 26$:
$$ |\vec{r}| = 26  \text{m} $$

Now compute the unit vector:
$$ 
\hat{u} = \frac{10\hat{\imath} - 24\hat{k}}{26} = \frac{10}{26}\hat{\imath} - \frac{24}{26}\hat{k}
$$

Simplify fractions:
$$ 
\frac{10}{26} = \frac{5}{13}, \quad \frac{24}{26} = \frac{12}{13}
$$

Thus, the unit vector is:
$$ \hat{u} = \frac{5}{13}\hat{\imath} - \frac{12}{13}\hat{k} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{5}{13}\hat{\imath} - \dfrac{12}{13}\hat{k}}$$

------
## Problem 4
Background:
In navigation and robotics, changing direction to avoid obstacles often requires computing vectors perpendicular to the current trajectory. Consider a drone moving with velocity vector $\vec{P} = 4\hat{i} + 3\hat{j}$ (in m/s). To reroute around an obstacle, the drone must compute a unit vector perpendicular to $\vec{P}$. A fundamental method involves rotating $\vec{P}$ by 90° in the xy-plane. For any vector $\langle a, b \rangle$, rotating it counterclockwise by 90° yields $\langle -b, a \rangle$, which is perpendicular because their dot product $a(-b) + b(a) = 0$.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Vector rotation in 2D Cartesian coordinates.
2. Dot product as a test for perpendicularity.
3. Magnitude calculation and normalization to obtain unit vectors.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This connects to vector algebra (projections, cross products) and coordinate geometry. The rotation method is a specific case of orthogonal transformations in linear algebra.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
Physics (kinematics for direction changes), computer graphics (sprite rotations), and control systems (robotic path planning).

Real-World Applications:
Drone navigation systems use real-time vector rotations to compute escape paths. GPS routing algorithms apply similar principles for abrupt direction changes.

Problem:
Using the 90° counterclockwise rotation method, derive the unit vector perpendicular to $\vec{P} = 4\hat{i} + 3\hat{j}$. Express the unit vector as a linear combination of $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ with exact fractional coefficients. Do not compute numerical approximations.

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply 90° counterclockwise rotation**  
The rotation formula transforms $\langle a, b \rangle$ to $\langle -b, a \rangle$. For $\vec{P} = 4\hat{i} + 3\hat{j}$:  

$$
\vec{Q} = -3\hat{i} + 4\hat{j}
$$


**Step 2: Verify perpendicularity**  
The dot product of $\vec{P}$ and $\vec{Q}$ must be zero:  

$$
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{Q} = (4)(-3) + (3)(4) = -12 + 12 = 0
$$
  
This confirms $\vec{Q} \perp \vec{P}$.

**Step 3: Compute magnitude of $\vec{Q}$**  

$$
|\vec{Q}| = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$


**Step 4: Normalize $\vec{Q}$ to a unit vector**  
Divide $\vec{Q}$ by its magnitude:  

$$
\hat{u} = \frac{\vec{Q}}{|\vec{Q}|} = \frac{-3\hat{i} + 4\hat{j}}{5} = -\frac{3}{5}\hat{i} + \frac{4}{5}\hat{j}
$$
  
This is the required unit vector.

## Answer
$$\boxed{-\dfrac{3}{5}\hat{i} + \dfrac{4}{5}\hat{j}}$$

# vector addition and subtraction methods

## Problem 0
**Background**  
In navigation and robotics, understanding displacement—the straight-line change in position—is critical for efficient path planning. Consider a scenario where an autonomous delivery robot must move from a starting point to a drop-off location and then to a charging station. The robot's path involves vector displacements in a Cartesian coordinate system aligned with cardinal directions: **east** as the positive $x$-axis and **north** as the positive $y$-axis.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
1. Vector addition and subtraction in component form.  
2. Magnitude calculation of a vector from its components.  
3. Geometric interpretation of vector operations.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem bridges core concepts in physics (displacement as a vector quantity) and geometry (Pythagorean theorem for magnitude calculation). It reinforces how vector decomposition simplifies multi-step motion analysis.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
Vector operations are essential in computer science (graphics rendering, game physics) and engineering (robotic path optimization, GPS navigation).  

**Real-World Applications**  
Delivery drones and self-driving cars use vector-based algorithms to compute shortest paths and adjust routes dynamically in response to new targets (e.g., rerouting to a charging station).  

**Problem Statement**  
A robot starts at point $O$. It first moves $a = 3  \text{km}$ east, then $b = 4  \text{km}$ north to reach point $P$. Upon arrival, it receives a command to move directly to a new charging station $Q$, where the displacement vector $\overrightarrow{OQ}$ is defined as **twice** the displacement vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$ in the **opposite direction**. Determine the **magnitude** of the displacement vector $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ (the direct path from $P$ to $Q$). Express your answer in kilometers as an exact number.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define displacement vectors**  
- The displacement $\overrightarrow{OP}$ is the vector sum of the two movements:  
  
$$
  \overrightarrow{OP} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}  \text{km}.
  $$
  

**Step 2: Determine $\overrightarrow{OQ}$**  
- $\overrightarrow{OQ}$ is twice $\overrightarrow{OP}$ in the opposite direction:  
  
$$
  \overrightarrow{OQ} = -2 \times \overrightarrow{OP} = -2 \times \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix}  \text{km}.
  $$
  

**Step 3: Compute $\overrightarrow{PQ}$**  
- The displacement from $P$ to $Q$ is the difference:  
  
$$
  \overrightarrow{PQ} = \overrightarrow{OQ} - \overrightarrow{OP} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -9 \\ -12 \end{pmatrix}  \text{km}.
  $$
  

**Step 4: Calculate magnitude**  
- The magnitude of $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ is:  
  
$$
  \left\| \overrightarrow{PQ} \right\| = \sqrt{(-9)^2 + (-12)^2} = \sqrt{81 + 144} = \sqrt{225} = 15  \text{km}.
  $$

## Problem 1
## Background
In a robotics competition, a robot must navigate an obstacle course. The robot has two thrusters: a primary thruster providing a force of 8 N in the robot's forward direction (positive x-axis), and a lateral thruster providing a force of 6 N perpendicular to the forward direction (positive y-axis). These thrusters operate simultaneously. The resultant force determines the robot's acceleration and trajectory. Understanding vector addition is essential for predicting motion in multi-force systems.

### Knowledge Points Tested
- Vector addition of perpendicular forces
- Magnitude calculation using the Pythagorean theorem
- Resolution of forces into components

### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to Newton's second law ($F_{\text{net}} = ma$), where the resultant force determines acceleration. It also relates to projectile motion and equilibrium analysis in statics, where vector resolution is fundamental.

### Interdisciplinary Connections
In engineering, vector addition models thruster configurations in robotics and aerospace systems. In navigation, it applies to wind/current corrections for ships/aircraft. Mathematically, it extends to complex number addition and Euclidean vector spaces.

### Real-World Applications
- Drone stabilization systems use perpendicular thrust vectors for controlled maneuvers.
- Spacecraft attitude control relies on orthogonal thrusters to adjust orientation.
- Biomechanics analyzes muscle forces in joints using vector resolution.

## Problem
The primary thruster exerts a force of 8 N along the positive x-axis. The lateral thruster exerts a force of 6 N along the positive y-axis. Calculate the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the robot.  
Express your answer in newtons (N) and provide only the numerical value.

**Final Answer Format Requirement**:  
- Your final answer must be a numerical value expressed in newtons (N).  
- Do not include the unit ("N") in the answer box.  
- Round to six significant digits if needed (though exact values are preferred).

## Solution
The resultant force $\vec{R}$ is the vector sum of the individual forces:  
$$ \vec{R} = \vec{F_x} + \vec{F_y} $$  
where $\vec{F_x} = 8  \text{N}  \hat{\imath}$ (x-direction) and $\vec{F_y} = 6  \text{N}  \hat{\jmath}$ (y-direction).  

Since the forces are perpendicular, the magnitude $R$ is given by the Pythagorean theorem:  
$$ R = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2} $$  

Substitute the given values:  
$$ R = \sqrt{(8)^2 + (6)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10 $$  

The magnitude of the resultant force is exactly 10 N.

## Problem 2
**Background**:  
In river navigation, a boat's velocity relative to the shore depends on both its self-propelled motion and the river current. This problem explores vector addition and subtraction in a relative motion context, specifically focusing on velocities in perpendicular directions. The scenario involves a boat moving in three distinct segments: upstream, downstream, and across the river. The net displacement condition provides a constraint to solve for the current's speed, enabling calculation of the boat's shore-relative velocity during the cross-stream segment.

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
- Vector addition/subtraction of velocities.  
- Displacement as the integral of velocity over time.  
- Independence of perpendicular motion components.  
- Solving systems of equations derived from kinematic constraints.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
This problem connects vector decomposition (mathematics) to relative motion kinematics (physics). It reinforces how motion in perpendicular directions (east-west vs. north-south) can be analyzed separately, a key concept in projectile motion and fluid dynamics.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
Principles of vector addition are essential in engineering (e.g., aeronautics for wind correction) and geosciences (e.g., ocean current modeling). The equation-solving aspect applies to optimization problems in operations research.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
Pilots adjusting for wind drift, swimmers navigating currents, and autonomous vehicles path-correcting in moving media (e.g., underwater drones in ocean currents).  

**Problem Statement**:  
A river flows from west to east with a constant current of magnitude $V$. A boat completes three segments of motion, each lasting time $T$:  
1. **Upstream**: Heads due west (against the current) with speedometer reading $U$ (velocity relative to water).  
2. **Downstream**: Heads due east (with the current) with speedometer reading $D$.  
3. **Cross-stream**: Heads due north (perpendicular to current) with speedometer reading $C$.  
After the three segments, the boat's net displacement in the east-west direction is zero. Find the magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the shore during the cross-stream (third) segment. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $U$, $D$, and $C$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define coordinate system and velocities**  
Set east as the positive $x$-direction and north as the positive $y$-direction. The river current is $\vec{V}_{\text{current}} = (V, 0)$.  

- **Upstream segment (west)**:  
  Boat's velocity relative to water: $\vec{v}_{bw1} = (-U, 0)$.  
  Velocity relative to shore: $\vec{v}_{bs1} = \vec{v}_{bw1} + \vec{V}_{\text{current}} = (-U + V, 0)$.  
  Displacement: $\vec{d}_1 = (-U + V)T \hat{\imath}$.  

- **Downstream segment (east)**:  
  Boat's velocity relative to water: $\vec{v}_{bw2} = (D, 0)$.  
  Velocity relative to shore: $\vec{v}_{bs2} = \vec{v}_{bw2} + \vec{V}_{\text{current}} = (D + V, 0)$.  
  Displacement: $\vec{d}_2 = (D + V)T \hat{\imath}$.  

- **Cross-stream segment (north)**:  
  Boat's velocity relative to water: $\vec{v}_{bw3} = (0, C)$.  
  Velocity relative to shore: $\vec{v}_{bs3} = \vec{v}_{bw3} + \vec{V}_{\text{current}} = (V, C)$.  

**Step 2: Apply east-west displacement constraint**  
Net $x$-displacement is zero:  

$$
d_{1x} + d_{2x} + d_{3x} = 0
$$
  
Substitute displacements:  

$$
(-U + V)T + (D + V)T + (V)T = 0
$$
  
Simplify algebraically:  

$$
(-U + V + D + V + V)T = 0 \implies -U + D + 3V = 0
$$
  
Solve for $V$:  

$$
V = \frac{U - D}{3}
$$
  

**Step 3: Compute shore-relative velocity in third segment**  

$$
\vec{v}_{bs3} = \left( V, C \right) = \left( \frac{U - D}{3}, C \right)
$$
  
Magnitude:  

$$
|\vec{v}_{bs3}| = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{U - D}{3} \right)^2 + C^2 } = \sqrt{ \frac{(U - D)^2}{9} + C^2 }
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \frac{(U - D)^2}{9} + C^2 }}$$

## Problem 3
**Background**:  
In navigation and robotics, vectors are essential for describing displacements. Consider a drone programmed to move with a displacement vector $\vec{B}$ from its starting point. Due to wind interference, it drifts and instead follows a displacement vector $\vec{A}$. To correct its path, the drone must compute the vector $\vec{C}$ that, when added to $\vec{A}$, results in $\vec{B}$. This correction vector is calculated using vector subtraction: $\vec{C} = \vec{B} - \vec{A}$.  

**Knowledge Points Tested**:  
- Vector subtraction: component-wise operations.  
- Interpretation of vectors as displacements in a plane.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**:  
Vector subtraction connects to vector addition (via $\vec{B} - \vec{A} = \vec{B} + (-\vec{A})$) and scalar multiplication (scaling by $-1$). It is foundational for topics like relative motion and force equilibria.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**:  
In engineering, vector subtraction models error correction in autonomous systems. In geography, it calculates drift corrections for navigation. In computer graphics, it adjusts object positions.  

**Real-World Applications**:  
- Drones/robots recalibrating paths after environmental disturbances.  
- Aircraft adjusting for wind drift during flight.  
- GPS systems compensating for positional errors.  

**Problem Statement**:  
A drone's intended displacement is $\vec{B} = (-3\hat{\imath} + 5\hat{\jmath})$ meters. Due to wind, its actual displacement is $\vec{A} = (7\hat{\imath} - 2\hat{\jmath})$ meters. Determine the correction vector $\vec{C} = \vec{B} - \vec{A}$. Express $\vec{C}$ in component form as $(C_x, C_y)$, where $C_x$ and $C_y$ are integers.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the vector subtraction operation**  
The correction vector is given by:  

$$
\vec{C} = \vec{B} - \vec{A}.
$$
  
Vector subtraction is performed component-wise.  

**Step 2: Subtract the $\hat{\imath}$-components**  
The $\hat{\imath}$-component of $\vec{C}$ is:  

$$
C_x = B_x - A_x,
$$
  
where $B_x = -3$ (from $\vec{B}$) and $A_x = 7$ (from $\vec{A}$).  

$$
C_x = (-3) - (7) = -3 - 7 = -10.
$$
  

**Step 3: Subtract the $\hat{\jmath}$-components**  
The $\hat{\jmath}$-component of $\vec{C}$ is:  

$$
C_y = B_y - A_y,
$$
  
where $B_y = 5$ (from $\vec{B}$) and $A_y = -2$ (from $\vec{A}$).  

$$
C_y = (5) - (-2) = 5 + 2 = 7.
$$
  

**Step 4: Write the vector in component form**  
Combining the results:  

$$
\vec{C} = (-10\hat{\imath} + 7\hat{\jmath})~\text{meters}.
$$
  
In component form, this is $(C_x, C_y) = (-10, 7)$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{(-10,\ 7)}$$

## Problem 4
Background:
In navigation and robotics, understanding net displacement is crucial for determining the shortest path between two points. Consider a robot moving on a grid aligned with cardinal directions: north (positive y-direction), south (negative y-direction), east (positive x-direction), and west (negative x-direction). The robot starts at the origin (0, 0) and executes three consecutive movements:  
- First movement: 10 meters due north  
- Second movement: 5 meters due west  
- Third movement: 3 meters due south  

Knowledge Points Tested:  
- Vector decomposition into Cartesian components  
- Vector addition and subtraction in two dimensions  
- Magnitude calculation using the Pythagorean theorem  

Intradisciplinary Connections:  
This problem connects to kinematics in physics (displacement as a vector quantity) and geometry (distance formulas in coordinate systems). It reinforces the concept that displacement depends only on start and end positions, not the path taken.  

Interdisciplinary Connections:  
Vector addition is fundamental in engineering (e.g., force analysis in statics), computer graphics (object translation), and geolocation (GPS path optimization).  

Real-World Applications:  
- Robotics: Calculating optimal paths for warehouse robots  
- Navigation: Determining straight-line distance for hikers or drones after a series of directional moves  
- Game development: Pathfinding algorithms for non-player characters  

Problem:  
Compute the magnitude of the robot's net displacement vector after the three movements. Express your answer as an exact value in meters without units.

## Solution
**Step 1: Represent displacements as vectors**  
Define the coordinate system:  
- Let $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ be the unit vector east and $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ be the unit vector north.  

Decompose each displacement:  
- 10 m north: $\vec{d_1} = 0\hat{\mathbf{x}} + 10\hat{\mathbf{y}}$  
- 5 m west: $\vec{d_2} = -5\hat{\mathbf{x}} + 0\hat{\mathbf{y}}$  
- 3 m south: $\vec{d_3} = 0\hat{\mathbf{x}} - 3\hat{\mathbf{y}}$  

**Step 2: Compute net displacement vector**  
Sum the components:  

$$
\vec{d}_{\text{net}} = \vec{d_1} + \vec{d_2} + \vec{d_3} = (0 - 5 + 0)\hat{\mathbf{x}} + (10 + 0 - 3)\hat{\mathbf{y}} = -5\hat{\mathbf{x}} + 7\hat{\mathbf{y}}
$$
  

**Step 3: Calculate magnitude**  
The magnitude of $\vec{d}_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{(\text{x-component})^2 + (\text{y-component})^2}$:  

$$
|\vec{d}_{\text{net}}| = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + (7)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 49} = \sqrt{74}
$$
  
The result $\sqrt{74}$ is exact and simplified, as 74 has no perfect-square factors other than 1.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{74}}$$

# velocity-time relationships in free fall

## Problem 0
**Background**

The study of motion under gravity is fundamental in physics. On the moon, the acceleration due to gravity, denoted $g_m$, is approximately one-sixth of that on Earth. This reduced gravity affects the motion of falling objects. In this problem, we consider a scenario involving a lunar rover moving at a constant horizontal velocity $v_0$ on the moon's surface. An astronaut on the rover drops a rock. At the moment of release, the rock is at rest relative to the rover. However, because the rover is moving, the rock has an initial horizontal velocity relative to the moon's surface. The rock then undergoes free fall under the moon's gravity. This scenario requires combining principles of constant-velocity motion (horizontal) and constant-acceleration motion (vertical).

**Knowledge Points Tested**
- Kinematics equations for motion with constant acceleration (free fall)
- Vector addition of velocity components
- Independence of motion in perpendicular directions
- Magnitude calculation for velocity vectors

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
This problem connects free-fall kinematics (vertical motion) to uniform motion (horizontal motion), demonstrating how projectile motion arises from the superposition of independent motions. It reinforces the concept that acceleration affects only the vertical component of velocity in free fall near a celestial body.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
The principles apply to aerospace engineering (e.g., calculating trajectories for lunar landers) and astronomy (e.g., modeling micrometeorite impacts on moons). The vector decomposition approach is also used in computer graphics for motion simulations.

**Real-World Applications**
Understanding this motion is critical for space missions, such as the Apollo program, where objects dropped from moving lunar vehicles exhibited similar behavior. It also models terrestrial applications like dropping supplies from a moving aircraft.

**Problem Statement**
A lunar rover travels horizontally on the moon's surface at a constant velocity $v_0$. An astronaut drops a rock from the rover, releasing it from rest relative to the rover. The moon's gravitational acceleration is $g_m$. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the rock's velocity after a time $t$ has elapsed since release. Then, for a specific elapsed time $T$, express this velocity magnitude in terms of $v_0$, $g_m$, and $T$.  

*Express your final answer as a single expression in terms of $v_0$, $g_m$, and $T$.*

## Solution
**Step 1: Analyze horizontal motion**  
The horizontal velocity remains constant because there is no acceleration in this direction (no horizontal forces). Since the rock was released from rest relative to the rover, it inherits the rover's horizontal velocity $v_0$ at the instant of release. At any time $t$, the horizontal velocity component is:  
$$ v_x = v_0 $$

**Step 2: Analyze vertical motion**  
The vertical motion has constant acceleration $g_m$ downward (moon's gravity). The rock is released with zero initial vertical velocity. Using the velocity-time equation for constant acceleration:  
$$ v_y = u_y + a_y t $$  
where $u_y = 0$ (initial vertical velocity), $a_y = g_m$, and $t$ is time. Thus:  
$$ v_y = g_m t $$

**Step 3: Combine velocity components**  
The magnitude of the velocity vector $v$ is found using the Pythagorean theorem:  
$$ v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} $$  
Substitute the expressions from Steps 1 and 2:  
$$ v = \sqrt{(v_0)^2 + (g_m t)^2} $$

**Step 4: Evaluate at time $T$**  
For the specific elapsed time $T$, substitute $t = T$:  
$$ v = \sqrt{v_0^2 + (g_m T)^2} $$  
This is the magnitude of the rock's velocity at time $T$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{v_0^{2} + \left(g_m T\right)^{2}}}$$

------
## Problem 1
Background:
  In a physics experiment, a ball is launched vertically upward using a spring-loaded mechanism attached to a drone. The drone is hovering at a fixed altitude, providing a stationary launch platform. The spring mechanism imparts an initial upward velocity of 15 m/s to the ball. The experiment occurs in Earth's gravitational field, characterized by acceleration due to gravity $g$ (directed downward). Air resistance is negligible. This scenario models velocity-time relationships in free fall, emphasizing how initial kinetic energy converts to gravitational potential energy.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  - Kinematic equations for constant acceleration
  - Interpretation of velocity-time graphs
  - Critical points in motion (e.g., maximum height where velocity = 0)
  - Algebraic derivation from fundamental principles

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  Connects to conservation of mechanical energy (kinetic to potential energy), projectile motion principles, and calculus-based definitions of velocity as the time-derivative of displacement. Provides foundation for harmonic motion analysis.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  - Aerospace Engineering: Trajectory calculations for rocket staging.
  - Sports Science: Analyzing jump heights in basketball.
  - Environmental Science: Modeling volcanic ash dispersion.

Real-World Applications:
  - Designing parachute deployment systems for spacecraft.
  - Calculating fuel-efficient ascent paths for rockets.
  - Timing fireworks displays for maximum visual effect.

Problem:
  Derive a symbolic expression for the time $t_{\text{max}}$ it takes the ball to reach its maximum height after launch. Use the equation of motion under constant acceleration, starting from the fundamental velocity-time relationship. Express $t_{\text{max}}$ in terms of the initial velocity $v_0 = 15 \text{ m/s}$ and gravitational acceleration $g$. Clearly state all assumptions and justify each step.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define the coordinate system and known quantities**  
- Assume upward motion as the positive direction.  
- Initial velocity $v_0 = +15  \text{m/s}$ (upward).  
- Constant acceleration $a = -g$ (downward; negative due to coordinate choice).  

**Step 2: Apply the velocity-time kinematic equation**  
The general equation for velocity under constant acceleration is:  
$$ v = v_0 + at $$  
Substitute $a = -g$:  
$$ v = v_0 - gt $$  

**Step 3: Identify condition for maximum height**  
At maximum height, the ball's velocity is zero ($v = 0$) because it momentarily stops before reversing direction. Set $v = 0$ in the equation:  
$$ 0 = v_0 - gt_{\text{max}} $$  

**Step 4: Solve for $t_{\text{max}}$ algebraically**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $t_{\text{max}}$:  
$$ gt_{\text{max}} = v_0 $$  
$$ t_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_0}{g} $$  

**Step 5: Substitute given value**  
Insert $v_0 = 15  \text{m/s}$:  
$$ t_{\text{max}} = \frac{15}{g} $$  

**Key assumptions:**  
- Gravitational acceleration $g$ is constant near Earth's surface.  
- No air resistance or external forces act on the ball.  
- The launch platform is inertial (non-accelerating).  

**Physical interpretation:**  
Time to reach maximum height is directly proportional to initial velocity and inversely proportional to gravitational strength. Doubling $v_0$ doubles $t_{\text{max}}$; doubling $g$ halves $t_{\text{max}}$.

## Answer
$$ \boxed{\dfrac{15}{g}} $$

------
## Problem 2
Background:
  When objects fall through a fluid like air, they experience a drag force that opposes their motion. For small, dense objects at moderate speeds, this force is often proportional to velocity—a model used in designing parachutes, analyzing raindrop formation, and predicting sedimentation rates in environmental science. This scenario explores how air resistance transforms simple free fall into a more complex physical system.

Knowledge Points Tested:
  - Newton's second law with velocity-dependent forces
  - Solving first-order differential equations by separation of variables
  - Integration of velocity to obtain displacement
  - Exponential decay in dissipative systems

Intradisciplinary Connections:
  Connects to kinematics (motion under constant acceleration) by showing how drag modifies acceleration, and to calculus through the solution of differential equations. Also relates to energy conservation when analyzing work done against drag.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
  Applies to aerospace engineering (parachute design), meteorology (raindrop dynamics), and biomechanics (analysis of falling objects in sports science).

Real-World Applications:
  Used to predict the descent rate of skydivers, calculate sedimentation rates of pollutants in air, and model the behavior of hailstones in storm clouds. Modern airbag sensors also rely on similar motion models.

Problem:
  A stone of mass $m$ is dropped from rest from a cliff on a planet with gravitational acceleration $g$. The stone experiences a drag force given by $-b v$, where $v$ is its velocity (positive downward) and $b$ is a drag constant. Derive an expression for the vertical displacement of the stone at $t = 3$ seconds. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $g$, $b$, and any necessary mathematical constants.

## Solution
**Step 1: Set up the differential equation**  
Newton's second law for vertical motion:  
$$ m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - bv $$  
Rearrange to isolate derivatives:  
$$ \frac{dv}{dt} = g - \frac{b}{m}v $$  

**Step 2: Solve for velocity $v(t)$**  
Separate variables and integrate:  
$$ \int \frac{dv}{g - \frac{b}{m}v} = \int dt $$  
Let $u = g - \frac{b}{m}v$, so $du = -\frac{b}{m} dv$:  
$$ -\frac{m}{b} \int \frac{du}{u} = \int dt $$  
$$ -\frac{m}{b} \ln \left| g - \frac{b}{m}v \right| = t + C $$  
Apply initial condition $v(0) = 0$:  
$$ -\frac{m}{b} \ln |g| = C $$  
Substitute $C$ and solve for $v$:  
$$ -\frac{m}{b} \ln \left| g - \frac{b}{m}v \right| = t - \frac{m}{b} \ln g $$  
$$ \ln \left( \frac{g - \frac{b}{m}v}{g} \right) = -\frac{b}{m}t $$  
$$ g - \frac{b}{m}v = g e^{-\frac{b}{m}t} $$  
$$ v(t) = \frac{mg}{b} \left( 1 - e^{-\frac{b}{m}t} \right) $$  

**Step 3: Integrate velocity to find displacement $y(t)$**  
$$ y(t) = \int_0^t v(\tau)  d\tau = \frac{mg}{b} \int_0^t \left( 1 - e^{-\frac{b}{m}\tau} \right) d\tau $$  
$$ y(t) = \frac{mg}{b} \left[ \tau + \frac{m}{b} e^{-\frac{b}{m}\tau} \right]_0^t $$  
$$ y(t) = \frac{mg}{b} \left[ t + \frac{m}{b} e^{-\frac{b}{m}t} - \frac{m}{b} \right] $$  
$$ y(t) = \frac{mg}{b} t - \frac{m^2 g}{b^2} \left( 1 - e^{-\frac{b}{m}t} \right) $$  

**Step 4: Evaluate at $t = 3$ seconds**  
$$ y(3) = \frac{mg}{b} (3) - \frac{m^2 g}{b^2} \left( 1 - e^{-\frac{3b}{m}} \right) $$

## Answer
$$ \boxed{\dfrac{3mg}{b} - \dfrac{m^{2} g}{b^{2}} \left(1 - e^{-\frac{3b}{m}}\right)} $$

## Problem 3
## Background
In physics, free fall is a common topic that explores the motion of objects under the influence of gravity. This problem focuses on velocity-time relationships for an object launched downward with an initial velocity. The scenario involves calculating the impact velocity—a key concept in kinematics that demonstrates how initial conditions and gravitational acceleration determine final motion states. Such calculations are vital in fields like engineering, safety testing, and ballistics.

### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Kinematics equations for constant acceleration**: Specifically, the equation $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta y$, where $v_f$ is final velocity, $v_i$ is initial velocity, $a$ is acceleration, and $\Delta y$ is displacement.
2. **Sign convention in vertical motion**: Downward direction is treated as positive for consistency.
3. **Velocity-time relationships**: How initial velocity and displacement influence final velocity under constant gravitational acceleration.

### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to **energy conservation** (kinetic and potential energy transformations) and **projectile motion**.
- Reinforces understanding of **acceleration due to gravity** as a constant in near-Earth scenarios.

### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Used to design airbags, crumple zones, and parachute systems by predicting impact forces.
- **Geology**: Models rockfall velocities in landslides or avalanches.
- **Sports Science**: Analyzes high-diving impacts or equipment durability.

### Real-World Applications
- Calculating the terminal velocity of skydivers.
- Determining safe drop heights for cargo deliveries.
- Crash-test simulations for vehicles (e.g., estimating impact speed from a specified height).

## Problem Statement
An object is launched **downward** from a height $h = 50  \text{m}$ with an initial downward velocity $v_0 = 8  \text{m/s}$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$ (directed downward). Neglect air resistance.  

Derive an expression for the **speed** of the object at the moment it impacts the ground. Express your answer in terms of $v_0$, $h$, and $g$.  

**Final Answer Format**:  
- Your answer must be a single mathematical expression.  
- Use `\sqrt{}` for square roots (e.g., `\sqrt{v_0^2 + 2gh}`).  
- Do **not** substitute numerical values for $g$.  
- Use the variables $v_0$, $h$, and $g$ exactly as defined.

## Solution
### Step-by-Step Derivation

#### Step 1: Define the kinematics equation
For motion under constant acceleration, the following equation relates initial velocity ($v_i$), final velocity ($v_f$), acceleration ($a$), and displacement ($\Delta y$):  
$$ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta y $$  

#### Step 2: Assign variables with sign convention
- **Initial velocity** ($v_i$): Since the object is launched downward, $v_i = v_0$ (positive, as downward is positive).  
- **Displacement** ($\Delta y$): The object falls a distance $h$ downward, so $\Delta y = +h$.  
- **Acceleration** ($a$): Gravity acts downward, so $a = +g$.  
- **Final velocity** ($v_f$): This is the velocity at impact (denoted as $v_{\text{impact}}$).  

#### Step 3: Substitute into the kinematics equation
Plug in the values:  
$$ v_{\text{impact}}^2 = v_0^2 + 2(g)(h) $$  
Simplify:  
$$ v_{\text{impact}}^2 = v_0^2 + 2gh $$  

#### Step 4: Solve for the impact speed
The impact **speed** is the magnitude of the velocity. Since the object is moving downward at impact, $v_{\text{impact}}$ is positive. Take the positive square root:  
$$ v_{\text{impact}} = \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2gh} $$  
(We discard the negative root because speed is a scalar and direction is already accounted for in the sign convention.)  

#### Conclusion
The expression for the impact speed is $\sqrt{v_0^2 + 2gh}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{v_0^{2} + 2 g h}}$$

# viscosity effects in fluid flow

## Problem 0
**Background:**  
When a small object falls through a viscous fluid, it initially accelerates due to gravity but eventually reaches a constant speed called the terminal velocity. At this point, the net force on the object is zero because the viscous drag force balances the effective weight (accounting for buoyancy). For small, spherical objects moving slowly in highly viscous fluids, the drag force follows **Stokes' law**: $ F_d = 6\pi \eta r v $, where $ \eta $ is the fluid's viscosity, $ r $ is the sphere's radius, and $ v $ is its velocity. This law applies only when the flow is laminar (smooth) and the Reynolds number is low (typically < 1), which is common in fluids like glycerol.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
1. Force equilibrium under constant velocity (Newton's first law).  
2. Application of Stokes' law for viscous drag.  
3. Buoyant force calculation via Archimedes' principle.  
4. Algebraic derivation of terminal velocity from force balance.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
- Connects to fluid dynamics (viscosity effects) and classical mechanics (force diagrams).  
- Extends to Reynolds number analysis for flow regimes (turbulent vs. laminar).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Chemistry/Materials Science:** Viscosity ($ \eta $) is a key property in non-Newtonian fluids like glycerol.  
- **Engineering:** Terminal velocity calculations are essential in designing sedimentation tanks, paint mixers, and pharmaceutical fluid systems.  

**Real-World Applications:**  
- Measuring fluid viscosity using falling-sphere viscometers.  
- Predicting settling rates of particles in wastewater treatment or oil refining.  

**Problem:**  
A steel ball bearing of radius $ r $ and density $ \rho_s $ falls through glycerol with density $ \rho_f $ and viscosity $ \eta $. The acceleration due to gravity is $ g $. Derive an expression for the terminal velocity $ v_t $ of the ball bearing.  

**Express your answer symbolically in terms of $ r $, $ \rho_s $, $ \rho_f $, $ \eta $, and $ g $.**

## Solution
**Step 1: Identify forces at terminal velocity**  
At terminal velocity, acceleration is zero, so net force = 0. The forces are:  
- **Weight** ($ W $) downward: $ W = \rho_s \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \cdot g $.  
- **Buoyant force** ($ F_b $) upward: $ F_b = \rho_f \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \cdot g $ (Archimedes' principle).  
- **Drag force** ($ F_d $) upward (from Stokes' law): $ F_d = 6\pi \eta r v_t $.  

**Step 2: Set up force balance equation**  
Net upward force = net downward force at equilibrium:  
$$ F_b + F_d = W $$  
Substitute expressions:  
$$ \rho_f \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 g + 6\pi \eta r v_t = \rho_s \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 g $$  

**Step 3: Solve for $ v_t $**  
Isolate $ v_t $:  
$$ 6\pi \eta r v_t = \rho_s \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 g - \rho_f \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 g $$  
Factor the right side:  
$$ 6\pi \eta r v_t = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 g (\rho_s - \rho_f) $$  
Divide both sides by $ 6\pi \eta r $:  
$$ v_t = \frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 g (\rho_s - \rho_f)}{6\pi \eta r} $$  
Simplify by canceling $ \pi $ and $ r $:  
$$ v_t = \frac{4 r^2 g (\rho_s - \rho_f)}{3 \cdot 6 \eta} = \frac{4 r^2 g (\rho_s - \rho_f)}{18 \eta} $$  
Reduce the fraction:  
$$ v_t = \frac{2 r^2 g (\rho_s - \rho_f)}{9 \eta} $$  
**Final symbolic expression:**  
$$ v_t = \frac{2}{9} \frac{g r^2 (\rho_s - \rho_f)}{\eta} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{2 g r^{2} \left(\rho_s - \rho_f\right)}{9 \eta}}$$

## Problem 1
**Background:**  
In fluid dynamics, the flow of viscous liquids through pipes is crucial for applications like oil transport, blood circulation, and chemical engineering. For laminar flow (smooth, layered motion), the pressure drop along a pipe arises from internal friction (viscosity). This problem explores how viscosity, flow rate, and pipe geometry govern pressure loss in olive oil flowing through a horizontal pipe.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Force balance in fluid elements under steady laminar flow.  
- Shear stress definition in viscous fluids.  
- Integration to derive velocity profiles and volumetric flow rates.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
This connects to fluid statics (pressure), dynamics (Newton's laws for fluids), and calculus (integration for flow rate).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
- **Engineering:** Designing pipelines for food processing (e.g., olive oil transport).  
- **Biology:** Modeling blood flow in arteries (analogous to viscous fluid dynamics).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Calculating pump power requirements for olive oil in food industry pipelines or estimating flow resistance in hydraulic systems.  

**Problem Statement:**  
Consider a horizontal pipe of radius $R$ carrying olive oil with dynamic viscosity $\eta$. The flow is steady, laminar, and fully developed. The volumetric flow rate is $Q$. By analyzing forces on a cylindrical fluid shell of radius $r$ ($0 < r < R$) and length $L$, derive the pressure drop per unit length $\Delta P / L$ in terms of $\eta$, $Q$, and $R$.  

**Requirements:**  
1. Set up the force-balance equation for the fluid shell.

Provide $\frac{\Delta P}{L}$ as a symbolic expression in terms of $\eta$, $Q$, and $R$.

## Solution
**Step 1: Force balance on a fluid shell**  
Consider a cylindrical fluid element of radius $r$, length $L$, and thickness $dr$ (Figure 1). Forces in the axial direction:  
- **Pressure force:** $(P_1 - P_2) \pi r^2 = \Delta P  \pi r^2$ (driving flow).  
- **Shear force:** Opposes motion. Shear stress $\tau = -\eta \frac{dv}{dr}$ acts on the lateral surface area $2\pi r L$. The net viscous force is $\tau \cdot 2\pi r L = -2\pi r L \eta \frac{dv}{dr}$.  

At steady state, net force $= 0$:  
$$
\Delta P  \pi r^2 - 2\pi r L \eta \frac{dv}{dr} = 0
$$  
Simplify:  
$$
\Delta P  r = -2 L \eta \frac{dv}{dr}
$$  
Rearrange:  
$$
\frac{dv}{dr} = -\frac{\Delta P}{2\eta L} r
\quad (1)
$$

**Step 2: Derive the velocity profile $v(r)$**  
Integrate Equation (1) with boundary condition $v(R) = 0$ (no-slip at pipe wall):  
$$
\int dv = -\frac{\Delta P}{2\eta L} \int r  dr
$$  
$$
v(r) = -\frac{\Delta P}{4\eta L} r^2 + C
$$  
Apply $v(R) = 0$:  
$$
0 = -\frac{\Delta P}{4\eta L} R^2 + C \implies C = \frac{\Delta P}{4\eta L} R^2
$$  
Thus:  
$$
v(r) = \frac{\Delta P}{4\eta L} (R^2 - r^2)
\quad (2)
$$

**Step 3: Compute volumetric flow rate $Q$**  
$Q$ is the integral of $v(r)$ over the cross-sectional area:  
$$
Q = \int_0^R v(r) \cdot 2\pi r  dr
$$  
Substitute $v(r)$ from Equation (2):  
$$
Q = \int_0^R \frac{\Delta P}{4\eta L} (R^2 - r^2) \cdot 2\pi r  dr = \frac{\pi \Delta P}{2\eta L} \int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3)  dr
$$  
Integrate:  
$$
\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3)  dr = \left[ \frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_0^R = \frac{R^4}{2} - \frac{R^4}{4} = \frac{R^4}{4}
$$  
So:  
$$
Q = \frac{\pi \Delta P}{2\eta L} \cdot \frac{R^4}{4} = \frac{\pi \Delta P R^4}{8\eta L}
\quad (3)
$$

**Step 4: Solve for $\Delta P / L$**  
Rearrange Equation (3):  
$$
\Delta P = \frac{8\eta L Q}{\pi R^4}
$$  
Divide by $L$:  
$$
\frac{\Delta P}{L} = \frac{8\eta Q}{\pi R^4}
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{8 \eta Q}{\pi R^{4}}}$$

## Problem 2
**Background**  
When objects move through fluids like water or air, they experience a viscous drag force due to the fluid's resistance. This force is especially important at low speeds, where viscous effects dominate over inertial forces (low Reynolds number). For example, small particles settling in water, microorganisms swimming, or fine dust in air exhibit this behavior. The drag on a sphere in this regime is a fundamental problem in fluid dynamics, with applications in environmental science (sedimentation), biomedical engineering (drug delivery nanoparticles), and industrial processes (filtration systems).

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Viscous stress in Newtonian fluids  
- Boundary conditions in fluid flow  
- Surface integration of stress components  
- Dimensional analysis and parameter dependence  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem connects to fluid statics (pressure distribution), continuum mechanics (stress tensors), and classical mechanics (force balance). It extends concepts of viscosity to dynamic scenarios, bridging hydrostatics and hydrodynamics.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**

---

**Problem Statement**  
A sphere of radius $R$ moves with constant velocity $v$ through an incompressible fluid of dynamic viscosity $\mu$. The flow is at low Reynolds number (creeping flow), where inertial forces are negligible. The velocity field in the fluid (in the rest frame of the sphere) is:  
$$  
u_r = v \cos\theta \left(1 - \frac{3R}{2r} + \frac{R^3}{2r^3}\right), \quad  
u_\theta = -v \sin\theta \left(1 - \frac{3R}{4r} - \frac{R^3}{4r^3}\right),  
$$  
and the pressure field is:  
$$  
p = p_0 - \frac{3\mu v R \cos\theta}{2r^2},  
$$  
where $p_0$ is the constant pressure far from the sphere, and $\theta$ is the polar angle from the direction of motion.  

The viscous stress tensor components in spherical coordinates are:  
- Radial stress: $\sigma_{rr} = -p + 2\mu \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial r}$  
- Tangential stress: $\sigma_{r\theta} = \mu \left( \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r} - \frac{u_\theta}{r} \right)$  

The drag force $F_d$ is obtained by integrating the $z$-component of the traction vector over the sphere's surface:  
$$  
t_z = \sigma_{rr} \cos\theta - \sigma_{r\theta} \sin\theta,  
$$  
$$  
F_d = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi t_z \big|_{r=R}  R^2 \sin\theta  d\theta  d\phi.  
$$  

**Task**  
Derive the expression for the drag force $F_d$ in terms of $\mu$, $R$, and $v$.  
*Express your final answer symbolically using the variables $\mu$, $R$, and $v$.*

## Solution
**Step 1: Compute partial derivatives at $r = R$**  
Evaluate the velocity field and its derivatives at the sphere's surface ($r = R$):  
- $u_r \big|_{r=R} = v \cos\theta \left(1 - \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right) = 0$  
- $u_\theta \big|_{r=R} = -v \sin\theta \left(1 - \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4}\right) = 0$ (no-slip condition)  

Radial derivative of $u_r$:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} = v \cos\theta \left( \frac{3R}{2r^2} - \frac{3R^3}{2r^4} \right).  
$$  
At $r = R$:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r=R} = v \cos\theta \left( \frac{3}{2R} - \frac{3}{2R} \right) = 0.  
$$  

Radial derivative of $u_\theta$:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r} = -v \sin\theta \left( \frac{3R}{4r^2} - \frac{3R^3}{4r^4} \right).  
$$  
At $r = R$:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r=R} = -v \sin\theta \left( \frac{3}{4R} - \frac{3}{4R} \right) = 0.  
$$  

Angular derivative of $u_r$:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} = -v \sin\theta \left(1 - \frac{3R}{2r} + \frac{R^3}{2r^3}\right) + v \cos\theta \cdot 0.  
$$  
At $r = R$:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} \bigg|_{r=R} = -v \sin\theta (0) = 0.  
$$  

**Step 2: Evaluate stress components at $r = R$**  
Radial stress:  
$$  
\sigma_{rr} \big|_{r=R} = -p + 2\mu \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r=R} = -\left( p_0 - \frac{3\mu v \cos\theta}{2R} \right) + 2\mu (0) = -p_0 + \frac{3\mu v \cos\theta}{2R}.  
$$  

Tangential stress:  
$$  
\sigma_{r\theta} \big|_{r=R} = \mu \left[ \frac{1}{R} \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} \bigg|_{r=R} + \frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r=R} - \frac{u_\theta}{R} \bigg|_{r=R} \right] = \mu \left[ \frac{1}{R} (0) + (0) - \frac{0}{R} \right] = 0.  
$$  

**Step 3: Compute the traction vector component $t_z$**  
$$  
t_z = \sigma_{rr} \cos\theta - \sigma_{r\theta} \sin\theta = \left( -p_0 + \frac{3\mu v \cos\theta}{2R} \right) \cos\theta - (0) \sin\theta = -p_0 \cos\theta + \frac{3\mu v \cos^2\theta}{2R}.  
$$  

**Step 4: Integrate over the sphere's surface**  
$$  
F_d = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \left( -p_0 \cos\theta + \frac{3\mu v \cos^2\theta}{2R} \right) R^2 \sin\theta  d\theta  d\phi.  
$$  
Split the integral:  
$$  
F_d = R^2 \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \left( -p_0 \cos\theta \sin\theta + \frac{3\mu v}{2R} \cos^2\theta \sin\theta \right) d\theta.  
$$  

Evaluate the $\phi$-integral:  
$$  
\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 2\pi.  
$$  

Now compute the $\theta$-integrals separately.  
First integral:  
$$  
\int_0^\pi -p_0 \cos\theta \sin\theta  d\theta = -\frac{p_0}{2} \int_0^\pi \sin(2\theta)  d\theta = -\frac{p_0}{2} \left[ -\frac{\cos(2\theta)}{2} \right]_0^\pi = -\frac{p_0}{4} \left[ \cos(2\pi) - \cos(0) \right] = 0.  
$$  

Second integral:  
$$  
\int_0^\pi \frac{3\mu v}{2R} \cos^2\theta \sin\theta  d\theta.  
$$  
Substitute $u = \cos\theta$, $du = -\sin\theta  d\theta$:  
$$  
= \frac{3\mu v}{2R} \int_{1}^{-1} -u^2  du = \frac{3\mu v}{2R} \int_{-1}^{1} u^2  du = \frac{3\mu v}{2R} \left[ \frac{u^3}{3} \right]_{-1}^{1} = \frac{3\mu v}{2R} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{\mu v}{R}.  
$$  

Combine results:  
$$  
F_d = R^2 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \left( 0 + \frac{\mu v}{R} \right) = 2\pi R^2 \cdot \frac{\mu v}{R} = 2\pi \mu R v.  
$$  

**Conclusion**  
The pressure term integrates to zero due to symmetry, leaving only the viscous contribution. The drag force is:  
$$  
F_d = 2\pi \mu R v.  
$$  
However, this result is incomplete because the original derivation by Stokes includes an additional factor. Re-examining the stress:  
The tangential stress $\sigma_{r\theta}$ was found to be zero, but this is incorrect. Recompute $\sigma_{r\theta}$:  
From the general formula:  
$$  
\sigma_{r\theta} = \mu \left( \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r} - \frac{u_\theta}{r} \right).  
$$  
At $r = R$, $u_r = u_\theta = 0$, but the derivatives are non-zero. Using earlier derivatives:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r=R} = -v \sin\theta \left( \frac{3R}{4R^2} - \frac{3R^3}{4R^4} \right) = -v \sin\theta \left( \frac{3}{4R} - \frac{3}{4R} \right) = 0,  
$$  
and  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} \bigg|_{r=R} = -v \sin\theta \left(1 - \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right) = 0.  
$$  
This still gives $\sigma_{r\theta}=0$, but the standard solution has $\sigma_{r\theta} \neq 0$. The error is in the velocity field derivatives. Correct velocity field derivatives:  

Radial derivative of $u_\theta$:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r} = -v \sin\theta \frac{d}{dr} \left(1 - \frac{3R}{4r} - \frac{R^3}{4r^3}\right) = -v \sin\theta \left( \frac{3R}{4r^2} - \frac{3R^3}{4r^4} \right).  
$$  
At $r = R$:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r=R} = -v \sin\theta \left( \frac{3}{4R} - \frac{3}{4R} \right) = 0.  
$$  

Angular derivative of $u_r$:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} = v \cos\theta \cdot \frac{d}{d\theta}(\cos\theta) \left(1 - \frac{3R}{2r} + \frac{R^3}{2r^3}\right) + v \cos\theta \cdot 0 = -v \sin\theta \left(1 - \frac{3R}{2r} + \frac{R^3}{2r^3}\right).  
$$  
At $r = R$:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} \bigg|_{r=R} = -v \sin\theta (0) = 0.  
$$  

This indicates an inconsistency. The standard Stokes solution has:  
$$  
\sigma_{r\theta} \big|_{r=R} = \mu \left( \frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r=R} \right) = \frac{3\mu v \sin\theta}{2R}.  
$$  
Using the correct expression:  
$$  
\frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r} \bigg|_{r=R} = -v \sin\theta \left( \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{R} + \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{R} \right) = -v \sin\theta \left( \frac{3}{2R} \right) = -\frac{3v \sin\theta}{2R}.  
$$  
Then:  
$$  
\sigma_{r\theta} \big|_{r=R} = \mu \left( 0 + \left(-\frac{3v \sin\theta}{2R}\right) - 0 \right) = -\frac{3\mu v \sin\theta}{2R}.  
$$  

Now, recompute $t_z$:  
$$  
t_z = \sigma_{rr} \cos\theta - \sigma_{r\theta} \sin\theta = \left( -p_0 + \frac{3\mu v \cos\theta}{2R} \right) \cos\theta - \left( -\frac{3\mu v \sin\theta}{2R} \right) \sin\theta.  
$$  
Simplify:  
$$  
t_z = -p_0 \cos\theta + \frac{3\mu v \cos^2\theta}{2R} + \frac{3\mu v \sin^2\theta}{2R} = -p_0 \cos\theta + \frac{3\mu v}{2R} (\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) = -p_0 \cos\theta + \frac{3\mu v}{2R}.  
$$  

Now integrate:  
$$  
F_d = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \left( -p_0 \cos\theta + \frac{3\mu v}{2R} \right) R^2 \sin\theta  d\theta  d\phi.  
$$  
First term:  
$$  
\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi -p_0 \cos\theta \sin\theta  d\theta = 2\pi \cdot \left( -\frac{p_0}{2} \int_0^\pi \sin(2\theta)  d\theta \right) = 0 \quad \text{(as before)}.  
$$  
Second term:  
$$  
\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \frac{3\mu v}{2R} R^2 \sin\theta  d\theta = 2\pi R^2 \cdot \frac{3\mu v}{2R} \int_0^\pi \sin\theta  d\theta = 2\pi R \cdot \frac{3\mu v}{2} \left[ -\cos\theta \right]_0^\pi.  
$$  
Evaluate:  
$$  
\left[ -\cos\theta \right]_0^\pi = (-\cos\pi) - (-\cos 0) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2.  
$$  
Thus:  
$$  
F_d = 2\pi R \cdot \frac{3\mu v}{2} \cdot 2 = 2\pi R \cdot 3\mu v = 6\pi \mu R v.  
$$

## Answer
$$\boxed{6\pi \mu R v}$$

## Problem 3
**Background:**  
Blood flow in capillaries is a fundamental process in the human body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues. The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity used to predict flow patterns—whether laminar (smooth) or turbulent (chaotic). For blood (density $\rho$, dynamic viscosity $\mu$) flowing through a cylindrical capillary of diameter $D$, Re is defined as $\text{Re} = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}$, where $v$ is the average flow velocity. However, in narrow capillaries, blood exhibits non-Newtonian behavior due to its composition (e.g., red blood cells), making viscosity $\mu$ dependent on vessel diameter. For simplicity, we model blood as a Newtonian fluid here.  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Definition of Reynolds number.  
- Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow in a cylindrical tube.  
- Relationship between volumetric flow rate, average velocity, and cross-sectional area.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
Connects fluid dynamics (Reynolds number, viscosity) with continuum mechanics (stress-strain relationships in fluids) and human physiology (blood flow properties).  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Applies physics (fluid mechanics) to biomedical contexts (hemodynamics) and engineering (design of microfluidic devices).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Predicting flow regimes in medical devices (e.g., IV catheters), understanding atherosclerosis risks (turbulent flow damages vessels), and optimizing lab-on-a-chip systems.  

**Problem Statement:**  
Blood of density $\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\mu$ flows through a horizontal capillary of diameter $D$ and length $L$. The pressure difference across the capillary is $\Delta P$. Derive an expression for the Reynolds number $\text{Re}$ of this flow. Use the Hagen-Poiseuille law to relate $\Delta P$ to the flow properties. Express $\text{Re}$ symbolically in terms of $\rho$, $\mu$, $D$, $L$, and $\Delta P$.  

**Final Answer Format:**  
Provide a single symbolic expression enclosed in `\boxed{}`. Use only the variables $\rho$, $\mu$, $D$, $L$, $\Delta P$, and standard mathematical operations/functions. Example: $\boxed{\dfrac{\rho D \Delta P}{32 \mu^{2} L}}$. Do not simplify further or substitute numerical values.

## Solution
**Step 1: Hagen-Poiseuille equation for volumetric flow rate**  
For laminar flow in a cylindrical tube, the volumetric flow rate $Q$ is given by:  
$$ Q = \frac{\pi D^4 \Delta P}{128 \mu L} $$  
where $D$ is the diameter, $\Delta P$ is the pressure difference, $\mu$ is dynamic viscosity, and $L$ is the tube length. (Note: This equation assumes constant viscosity and no-slip boundary conditions.)  

**Step 2: Relate volumetric flow rate to average velocity**  
The cross-sectional area $A$ of the capillary is:  
$$ A = \pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} $$  
The average velocity $v$ is related to $Q$ and $A$ by:  
$$ v = \frac{Q}{A} $$  
Substitute $Q$ from Step 1:  
$$ v = \frac{\frac{\pi D^4 \Delta P}{128 \mu L}}{\frac{\pi D^2}{4}} = \frac{D^4 \Delta P}{128 \mu L} \cdot \frac{4}{\pi D^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\pi^{-1}} = \frac{D^2 \Delta P}{32 \mu L} $$  
Simplification:  
$$ v = \frac{D^2 \Delta P}{32 \mu L} $$  

**Step 3: Reynolds number definition**  
The Reynolds number is:  
$$ \text{Re} = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu} $$  
Substitute $v$ from Step 2:  
$$ \text{Re} = \frac{\rho}{\mu} \cdot D \cdot \left( \frac{D^2 \Delta P}{32 \mu L} \right) = \frac{\rho D}{\mu} \cdot \frac{D^2 \Delta P}{32 \mu L} $$  
Simplify:  
$$ \text{Re} = \frac{\rho D^3 \Delta P}{32 \mu^2 L} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The Reynolds number for blood flow in the capillary is $\dfrac{\rho D^3 \Delta P}{32 \mu^2 L}$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\rho D^{3} \Delta P}{32 \mu^{2} L}}$$

## Problem 4
**Background**

In fluid dynamics, understanding how viscous fluids flow between surfaces is crucial for applications ranging from lubrication in machinery to the processing of food products like honey. This problem examines the flow of honey, a highly viscous fluid, confined between two parallel plates. The bottom plate is stationary, while the top plate moves parallel to itself at a constant velocity, dragging the fluid along. This setup models real-world systems such as journal bearings or industrial coating processes where a moving surface shears a fluid. The viscosity $\mu$ of honey resists relative motion between fluid layers, leading to a velocity distribution across the gap. 

**Knowledge Points Tested**
- Newton's law of viscosity: Shear stress $\tau$ is proportional to the velocity gradient, $\tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy}$.
- Force balance in a fluid element under steady flow conditions.
- Solving second-order ordinary differential equations with boundary conditions.
- Application of no-slip boundary conditions at solid-fluid interfaces.

**Intradisciplinary Connections**
This problem bridges concepts from fluid mechanics (viscosity, shear flow) and classical mechanics (Newton's second law for force balance). It extends the idea of linear momentum conservation to continuous media and reinforces how differential equations model physical systems.

**Interdisciplinary Connections**
The mathematics of integration and boundary value problems is central. Engineering applications include designing lubrication systems and optimizing fluid transport in chemical processing.

**Real-World Applications**
- **Lubrication:** Bearings in engines use a thin layer of viscous fluid between moving parts to reduce friction.
- **Food Processing:** Controlling honey flow during bottling or mixing requires understanding its velocity profile under shear.
- **Bioprocessing:** Similar flows occur in medical devices handling blood or synovial fluid.

**Problem**

Consider honey (dynamic viscosity $\mu$) flowing steadily between two infinite parallel plates separated by distance $h$. The bottom plate ($y = 0$) is fixed, and the top plate ($y = h$) moves with constant velocity $U$ in the $x$-direction. Assume laminar, fully developed flow with no pressure gradient along $x$.  

1. Derive the velocity profile $u(y)$ for $0 \leq y \leq h$ by:
   - Performing a force balance on a differential fluid element.
   - Applying Newton's law of viscosity and the no-slip boundary conditions.
2. Express $u(y)$ symbolically in terms of $y$, $U$, $h$, and $\mu$.

**Final Answer Format**  
Provide the expression for $u(y)$ as a function of $y$. Use the symbols $U$, $h$, and $\mu$ as defined. Box the final expression in simplified form.

## Solution
### Step 1: Force balance on a fluid element
Consider a differential fluid element of thickness $dy$, length $dx$, and unit depth (into the page). The forces in the $x$-direction arise from shear stresses on the top and bottom faces.  
- Shear force on bottom face: $\tau(y) \cdot (dx \cdot 1)$  
- Shear force on top face: $-\left(\tau(y) + \frac{d\tau}{dy} dy\right) \cdot (dx \cdot 1)$  

Since the flow is steady and unidirectional, net force $= 0$:  

$$
\tau(y)  dx - \left(\tau(y) + \frac{d\tau}{dy} dy\right) dx = 0
$$
  
Simplifying:  

$$
-\frac{d\tau}{dy}  dy  dx = 0 \implies \frac{d\tau}{dy} = 0
$$
  
Thus, $\tau$ is constant across the gap:  

$$
\tau = \text{constant} \quad (1)
$$


### Step 2: Apply Newton's law of viscosity
Newton's law states $\tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy}$. Substituting into (1):  

$$
\mu \frac{du}{dy} = \text{constant} \quad (2)
$$


### Step 3: Solve the differential equation
From (2):  

$$
\frac{du}{dy} = C_1 \quad \text{(constant)}
$$
  
Integrate with respect to $y$:  

$$
u(y) = C_1 y + C_2 \quad (3)
$$


### Step 4: Apply boundary conditions
- **At $y = 0$ (bottom plate):** $u = 0$  
  
$$
  0 = C_1 \cdot 0 + C_2 \implies C_2 = 0
  $$
  
- **At $y = h$ (top plate):** $u = U$  
  
$$
  U = C_1 h + 0 \implies C_1 = \frac{U}{h}
  $$
  

### Step 5: Write the velocity profile
Substitute $C_1$ and $C_2$ into (3):  

$$
u(y) = \frac{U}{h} y
$$
  
This linear profile satisfies the governing equation and boundary conditions.

## Answer
\[
\boxed{u(y) = \frac{U}{h} y}
\]

## Problem 5
Background:
In industrial fluid systems, such as those used in chemical processing or food manufacturing, the viscosity of a fluid can change due to factors like temperature variations. This problem examines glycerin flowing through a horizontal pipe under a constant pressure difference. Glycerin's viscosity is highly temperature-sensitive; a drop in temperature can double its viscosity. You will model this scenario using fundamental principles of fluid dynamics to determine how the flow rate responds to such a change.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Force balance on a fluid element in steady laminar flow.
2. Newton's law of viscosity and its application to shear stress.
3. Derivation of the velocity profile in cylindrical coordinates.
4. Integration to obtain volumetric flow rate (Hagen-Poiseuille equation).
5. Proportional reasoning to analyze changes in system parameters.

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects viscosity to the broader study of fluid mechanics, reinforcing concepts like shear stress, pressure gradients, and conservation laws. It extends to turbulence onset and Reynolds number analysis, highlighting how viscosity governs flow regimes.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
- **Biology/Medicine**: Models blood flow in capillaries (where viscosity changes affect perfusion rates).
- **Engineering**: Applies to pipeline design in petroleum engineering (e.g., crude oil viscosity variations).
- **Environmental Science**: Informs aquifer modeling, where groundwater viscosity shifts with temperature.

Real-World Applications:
- Medical IV drips: Viscosity changes alter flow rates in constant-pressure systems.
- Automotive engineering: Engine oil viscosity affects lubrication at different temperatures.
- Food industry: Pumping honey or syrup, where cooling increases viscosity.

Problem:
A horizontal pipe of length $L$ and radius $R$ carries glycerin under a constant pressure difference $\Delta P$ between its ends. The flow is laminar, steady, and fully developed. Initially, the dynamic viscosity is $\mu$. Due to a temperature change, the viscosity doubles to $2\mu$. 

Starting from a force balance on a cylindrical fluid element, derive the expression for the original volumetric flow rate $Q_1$. Then, find the ratio $Q_2/Q_1$, where $Q_2$ is the flow rate after the viscosity doubles. Explicitly state all assumptions.

**Final Answer Format**:  
Express the ratio $Q_2/Q_1$ as a reduced fraction (e.g., $a/b$). Your answer must be a single fraction with no units.

## Solution
### Assumptions:
1. Steady, laminar, incompressible flow.
2. Fully developed flow (velocity profile unchanging along the pipe).
3. Newtonian fluid (shear stress proportional to strain rate).
4. No-slip boundary condition at the pipe wall.
5. Horizontal pipe (gravity effects negligible).

### Step 1: Force balance on a fluid element
Consider a cylindrical fluid element of radius $r$, thickness $dr$, and length $\Delta x$. Forces in the axial direction ($x$) include:
- Pressure force at $x$: $P(x) \cdot \pi r^2$
- Pressure force at $x + \Delta x$: $-P(x + \Delta x) \cdot \pi r^2$
- Shear force on inner surface: $-\tau(r) \cdot 2\pi r \Delta x$ (opposes flow)
- Shear force on outer surface: $\tau(r + dr) \cdot 2\pi (r + dr) \Delta x$ (aids flow)

At steady state, net force $= 0$:
$$
[P(x) - P(x + \Delta x)] \pi r^2 + \tau(r + dr) \cdot 2\pi (r + dr) \Delta x - \tau(r) \cdot 2\pi r \Delta x = 0.
$$

### Step 2: Simplify and take limits
Divide by $2\pi \Delta x$ and rearrange:
$$
\frac{P(x) - P(x + \Delta x)}{2 \Delta x} r^2 + \tau(r + dr) (r + dr) - \tau(r) r = 0.
$$
As $\Delta x \to 0$ and $dr \to 0$:
$$
-\frac{dP}{dx} \cdot \frac{r^2}{2} + \frac{d}{dr}(\tau r) dr = 0 \implies \frac{d}{dr}(\tau r) = \frac{r^2}{2} \frac{dP}{dx}.
$$
Integrate with respect to $r$:
$$
\tau r = \frac{r^3}{6} \frac{dP}{dx} + C_1 \implies \tau = \frac{r^2}{6} \frac{dP}{dx} + \frac{C_1}{r}.
$$
Since $\tau$ must be finite at $r=0$, $C_1 = 0$. Thus:
$$
\tau = -\frac{r}{2} \frac{dP}{dx} \quad \left(\text{note: } \frac{dP}{dx} < 0 \text{ for flow in } +x\text{-direction}\right).
$$

### Step 3: Apply Newton's law of viscosity
For a Newtonian fluid:
$$
\tau = -\mu \frac{du}{dr},
$$
where $u$ is axial velocity. Substitute $\tau$:
$$
-\mu \frac{du}{dr} = -\frac{r}{2} \frac{dP}{dx} \implies \mu \frac{du}{dr} = \frac{r}{2} \frac{dP}{dx}.
$$
Integrate:
$$
u(r) = \frac{1}{4\mu} \frac{dP}{dx} r^2 + C_2.
$$

### Step 4: Apply no-slip boundary condition
At $r = R$, $u = 0$:
$$
0 = \frac{1}{4\mu} \frac{dP}{dx} R^2 + C_2 \implies C_2 = -\frac{1}{4\mu} \frac{dP}{dx} R^2.
$$
Thus:
$$
u(r) = \frac{1}{4\mu} \frac{dP}{dx} (r^2 - R^2).
$$

### Step 5: Derive volumetric flow rate $Q$
Integrate velocity over the cross-section:
$$
Q = \int_0^R u(r) \cdot 2\pi r  dr = \frac{2\pi}{4\mu} \frac{dP}{dx} \int_0^R (r^3 - R^2 r)  dr.
$$
Solve the integral:
$$
\int_0^R (r^3 - R^2 r)  dr = \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} - R^2 \frac{r^2}{2} \right]_0^R = \frac{R^4}{4} - \frac{R^4}{2} = -\frac{R^4}{4}.
$$
Substitute:
$$
Q = \frac{\pi}{2\mu} \frac{dP}{dx} \left(-\frac{R^4}{4}\right) = -\frac{\pi R^4}{8\mu} \frac{dP}{dx}.
$$
Since $\frac{dP}{dx} = -\frac{\Delta P}{L}$ (constant pressure drop):
$$
Q = -\frac{\pi R^4}{8\mu} \left(-\frac{\Delta P}{L}\right) = \frac{\pi \Delta P R^4}{8\mu L}.
$$
This is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. For initial viscosity $\mu$:
$$
Q_1 = \frac{\pi \Delta P R^4}{8\mu L}.
$$

### Step 6: Find flow rate ratio after viscosity doubles
New viscosity $= 2\mu$, so:
$$
Q_2 = \frac{\pi \Delta P R^4}{8(2\mu) L} = \frac{\pi \Delta P R^4}{16\mu L}.
$$
Thus, the ratio:
$$
\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \frac{\pi \Delta P R^4 / (16\mu L)}{\pi \Delta P R^4 / (8\mu L)} = \frac{8\mu L}{16\mu L} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$
The flow rate halves when viscosity doubles.

# wave reflection and transmission

## Problem 0
**Background:**  
In wave physics, the reflection of waves at a boundary depends on the boundary condition. For a string fixed at a rigid wall, the reflected wave has the same amplitude but inverted phase. However, real-world boundaries often exhibit damping, modeled as a dashpot, which dissipates energy. Consider a string of linear density $\mu$ under tension $T$, attached at $x=0$ to a wall via a dashpot with damping coefficient $b$. A harmonic wave of amplitude $A$ (real and positive) and angular frequency $\omega$ travels in the positive $x$-direction toward the boundary. The incident wave is:  

$$ y_i(x,t) = A e^{i(kx - \omega t)} $$
  
where the wave number $k = \omega \sqrt{\mu / T}$ (since wave speed $v = \sqrt{T / \mu}$). The reflected wave is:  

$$ y_r(x,t) = B e^{i(-k x - \omega t)} $$
  
where $B$ is the complex amplitude of the reflected wave. The total wave is $y(x,t) = y_i(x,t) + y_r(x,t)$.  

The boundary condition at $x=0$ balances the transverse tension force with the dashpot force (proportional to velocity):  

$$ T \left. \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right|_{x=0} = -b \left. \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right|_{x=0} $$
  

**Knowledge Points Tested:**  
- Wave propagation on a string and complex exponential representation.  
- Boundary conditions for damped reflections.  
- Derivation of reflection coefficients and magnitude calculations.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections:**  
Connects to impedance concepts in wave optics (Fresnel equations) and quantum scattering, where boundary conditions determine reflection/transmission.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**  
Mechanical engineering (dampers in vibration control) and acoustics (sound absorption materials).  

**Real-World Applications:**  
Dashpots model energy-dissipating boundaries in seismic isolation systems, vehicle suspensions, and anechoic chambers.  

**Problem:**  
Using the above, derive an expression for the magnitude of the reflected wave amplitude, $|B|$, in terms of $A$, $\mu$, $T$, $b$, and $\omega$.  

**Final Answer Format:**  
Express $|B|$ as:  

$$ |B| = A \cdot \frac{ \left| \sqrt{T\mu} - b \right| }{ \sqrt{T\mu} + b } $$
  
Use the absolute value as shown. The parameters are $A$ (amplitude), $\mu$ (linear density), $T$ (tension), $b$ (damping coefficient), and $\omega$ (angular frequency).

## Solution
**Step 1: Apply the boundary condition at $x=0$**  
The total displacement at $x=0$ is:  

$$ y(0,t) = [A + B] e^{-i \omega t} $$
  
The spatial derivative at $x=0$ is:  

$$ \left. \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right|_{x=0} = \left[ i k A e^{i(k \cdot 0 - \omega t)} - i k B e^{i(-k \cdot 0 - \omega t)} \right] = i k (A - B) e^{-i \omega t} $$
  
The time derivative at $x=0$ is:  

$$ \left. \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right|_{x=0} = -i \omega (A + B) e^{-i \omega t} $$
  
Substitute into the boundary condition:  

$$ T \cdot i k (A - B) e^{-i \omega t} = -b \cdot \left[-i \omega (A + B) e^{-i \omega t}\right] $$
  

**Step 2: Simplify the equation**  
Divide both sides by $e^{-i \omega t}$ (nonzero) and rearrange:  

$$ i k T (A - B) = i \omega b (A + B) $$
  
Divide by $i$ (noting $i/i = 1$):  

$$ k T (A - B) = \omega b (A + B) $$
  

**Step 3: Solve for $B$**  
Expand and collect terms:  

$$ k T A - k T B = \omega b A + \omega b B $$
  

$$ k T A - \omega b A = k T B + \omega b B $$
  

$$ A (k T - \omega b) = B (k T + \omega b) $$
  

$$ B = A \frac{k T - \omega b}{k T + \omega b} $$
  

**Step 4: Substitute $k = \omega \sqrt{\mu / T}$**  

$$ k T = \omega \sqrt{\mu / T} \cdot T = \omega \sqrt{\mu T} $$
  
Thus:  

$$ B = A \frac{\omega \sqrt{\mu T} - \omega b}{\omega \sqrt{\mu T} + \omega b} = A \frac{\sqrt{\mu T} - b}{\sqrt{\mu T} + b} \quad (\text{since} \ \omega \neq 0) $$
  

**Step 5: Compute the magnitude $|B|$**  
Since $B$ is real:  

$$ |B| = \left| A \frac{\sqrt{\mu T} - b}{\sqrt{\mu T} + b} \right| $$
  
Given $A > 0$ and $\sqrt{\mu T} + b > 0$ (as $\mu, T, b \geq 0$):  

$$ |B| = A \frac{ \left| \sqrt{\mu T} - b \right| }{ \sqrt{\mu T} + b } $$
  
The absolute value accounts for cases where $\sqrt{\mu T} - b < 0$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{A \dfrac{ \left| \sqrt{T\mu} - b \right| }{ \sqrt{T\mu} + b }}$$

## Problem 1
Background:
When light travels from one medium to another, part of it is reflected and part is transmitted. The fraction of light reflected depends on the angle of incidence, the polarization of the light, and the refractive indices of the media. For unpolarized (natural) light, the reflected intensity is the average of the intensities for two orthogonal polarizations: s-polarization (perpendicular to the plane of incidence) and p-polarization (parallel to the plane of incidence). The reflectance for each polarization is given by the Fresnel equations:

- For s-polarization:  
  $$ R_s = \left( \frac{n_1 \cos \theta_i - n_2 \cos \theta_t}{n_1 \cos \theta_i + n_2 \cos \theta_t} \right)^2 $$  
- For p-polarization:  
  $$ R_p = \left( \frac{n_2 \cos \theta_i - n_1 \cos \theta_t}{n_2 \cos \theta_i + n_1 \cos \theta_t} \right)^2 $$  

where:  
- $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the first and second medium, respectively.  
- $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence.  
- $\theta_t$ is the angle of transmission, found using Snell's law: $n_1 \sin \theta_i = n_2 \sin \theta_t$.  

In this problem, light is incident from air ($n_1 = 1$) to glass ($n_2 = 1.5$) at $\theta_i = 30^\circ$. The incident light is unpolarized with intensity $I_0$. The reflected intensity $I_r$ is given by $I_r = \frac{1}{2} (R_s + R_p) I_0$.  

Knowledge Points Tested:  
- Application of Snell's law to determine the transmission angle.  
- Understanding of reflection coefficients for s- and p-polarizations.  
- Calculation of reflected intensity for unpolarized light.  

Intradisciplinary Connections:  
This problem connects wave optics (Fresnel equations) with trigonometry and algebra. It extends to concepts like Brewster's angle and total internal reflection.  

Interdisciplinary Connections:  
The principles are used in optical engineering (e.g., designing anti-reflective coatings) and materials science (e.g., analyzing light interaction with surfaces).  

Real-World Applications:  
Calculating reflected intensity is essential in designing camera lenses, solar panels, and architectural glass to minimize unwanted reflections and maximize light transmission.  

Problem:  
Calculate the ratio $I_r / I_0$ for unpolarized light with incident intensity $I_0$ reflecting off glass ($n_2 = 1.5$) at $30^\circ$ incidence from air ($n_1 = 1$). Use exact values for trigonometric functions where applicable, but express your final answer as a decimal rounded to four decimal places.

## Solution
**Step 1: Determine the transmission angle $\theta_t$ using Snell's law**  
Snell's law states:  
$$ n_1 \sin \theta_i = n_2 \sin \theta_t $$  
Substitute $n_1 = 1$, $n_2 = 1.5$, and $\theta_i = 30^\circ$:  
$$ (1) \cdot \sin 30^\circ = (1.5) \cdot \sin \theta_t $$  
Since $\sin 30^\circ = 1/2$:  
$$ \frac{1}{2} = 1.5 \cdot \sin \theta_t $$  
Solve for $\sin \theta_t$:  
$$ \sin \theta_t = \frac{1/2}{1.5} = \frac{1}{3} $$  
Now find $\cos \theta_t$:  
$$ \cos \theta_t = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta_t} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{9}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} $$  

**Step 2: Calculate $\cos \theta_i$**  
$$ \cos \theta_i = \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$  

**Step 3: Compute reflectance for s-polarization ($R_s$)**  
The formula for $R_s$ is:  
$$ R_s = \left( \frac{n_1 \cos \theta_i - n_2 \cos \theta_t}{n_1 \cos \theta_i + n_2 \cos \theta_t} \right)^2 $$  
Substitute $n_1 = 1$, $n_2 = 1.5$, $\cos \theta_i = \sqrt{3}/2$, and $\cos \theta_t = 2\sqrt{2}/3$:  
$$ R_s = \left( \frac{(1) \cdot (\sqrt{3}/2) - (1.5) \cdot (2\sqrt{2}/3)}{(1) \cdot (\sqrt{3}/2) + (1.5) \cdot (2\sqrt{2}/3)} \right)^2 $$  
Simplify the numerator and denominator:  
- Numerator: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 1.5 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \sqrt{2}$  
- Denominator: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 1.5 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \sqrt{2}$  
Thus:  
$$ R_s = \left( \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \sqrt{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \sqrt{2}} \right)^2 $$  

**Step 4: Compute reflectance for p-polarization ($R_p$)**  
The formula for $R_p$ is:  
$$ R_p = \left( \frac{n_2 \cos \theta_i - n_1 \cos \theta_t}{n_2 \cos \theta_i + n_1 \cos \theta_t} \right)^2 $$  
Substitute the values:  
$$ R_p = \left( \frac{(1.5) \cdot (\sqrt{3}/2) - (1) \cdot (2\sqrt{2}/3)}{(1.5) \cdot (\sqrt{3}/2) + (1) \cdot (2\sqrt{2}/3)} \right)^2 $$  
Simplify:  
- Numerator: $1.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} - \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$  
- Denominator: $1.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$  
Thus:  
$$ R_p = \left( \frac{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} - \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}}{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}} \right)^2 $$  

**Step 5: Compute numerical values of $R_s$ and $R_p$**  
Use $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.41421356237$ and $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205080757$:  
- **For $R_s$**:  
  Numerator: $\frac{1.73205080757}{2} - 1.41421356237 = 0.866025403785 - 1.41421356237 = -0.548188158585$  
  Denominator: $0.866025403785 + 1.41421356237 = 2.280238966155$  
  $$ r_s = \frac{-0.548188158585}{2.280238966155} \approx -0.240386 $$  
  $$ R_s = (-0.240386)^2 \approx 0.057785 $$  
- **For $R_p$**:  
  Numerator: $\frac{3 \cdot 1.73205080757}{4} - \frac{2 \cdot 1.41421356237}{3} = \frac{5.19615242271}{4} - \frac{2.82842712474}{3} = 1.2990381056775 - 0.94280904158 \approx 0.3562290640975$  
  Denominator: $1.2990381056775 + 0.94280904158 \approx 2.2418471472575$  
  $$ r_p = \frac{0.3562290640975}{2.2418471472575} \approx 0.158902 $$  
  $$ R_p = (0.158902)^2 \approx 0.025250 $$  

**Step 6: Calculate the reflected intensity ratio $I_r / I_0$**  
For unpolarized light:  
$$ \frac{I_r}{I_0} = \frac{1}{2} (R_s + R_p) = \frac{1}{2} (0.057785 + 0.025250) = \frac{1}{2} (0.083035) = 0.0415175 $$  
Round to four decimal places:  
- The fifth decimal digit is 1, which is less than 5, so we do not round up.  
- Thus, $0.0415175$ rounded to four decimal places is $0.0415$.

## Answer
$$\boxed{0.0415}$$

## Problem 2
**Background**  
When a sound wave encounters a boundary between two different media, part of it reflects back into the original medium, and part transmits into the new medium. This phenomenon governs technologies like sonar, medical ultrasound, and noise-canceling systems. The pressure reflection coefficient quantifies the fraction of the incident sound wave's pressure amplitude that reflects at the interface. It depends on the acoustic impedances of the media, which are determined by their densities and sound speeds. For air and water, the significant density difference leads to strong reflection, explaining why sound travels poorly from air to water (e.g., shouting underwater is ineffective).  

**Knowledge Points Tested**  
- Boundary conditions for pressure and particle velocity continuity at an interface.  
- Definition and role of acoustic impedance ($Z = \rho c$) in wave reflection.  
- Derivation of reflection coefficients using fundamental wave properties.  

**Intradisciplinary Connections**  
This problem extends the concept of wave impedance to mechanical waves (sound), analogous to impedance in electromagnetic waves (light) and transmission lines. It reinforces wave continuity principles used in optics and seismology.  

**Interdisciplinary Connections**  
- **Engineering**: Sonar and ultrasound imaging rely on reflection coefficients to interpret signals.  
- **Biology**: Marine mammals use sound reflection/transmission for echolocation in water-air environments.  
- **Environmental Science**: Underwater acoustics models for pollution tracking or climate studies depend on interface reflections.  

**Real-World Applications**  
- **Submarine Sonar**: Detects objects by analyzing sound reflections at air-water interfaces.  
- **Architectural Acoustics**: Materials designed to minimize sound reflection in concert halls.  
- **Medical Diagnostics**: Ultrasound measures tissue boundaries using impedance mismatches.  

**Problem Statement**  
A plane sound wave of pressure amplitude $A_i$ travels through air (density $\rho_a$, speed of sound $c_a$) and strikes a planar air-water interface at normal incidence. Water has density $\rho_w$ and speed of sound $c_w$. Derive the pressure reflection coefficient $R$, defined as the ratio of the reflected pressure amplitude $A_r$ to the incident pressure amplitude $A_i$. Use the boundary conditions for pressure and particle velocity continuity, along with the acoustic impedance definition $Z = \rho c$.  

**Final Answer Format**  
Express $R$ symbolically as a single fraction in terms of $\rho_a$, $\rho_w$, $c_a$, and $c_w$. Simplify the expression completely. Do not substitute numerical values or use intermediate variables like $Z_a$ or $Z_w$ in the final answer.

## Solution
**Step 1: Define wave equations and impedances**  
The incident pressure wave in air ($x < 0$) is:  
$$ p_i(x,t) = A_i e^{i(\omega t - k_a x)} $$  
The reflected wave in air is:  
$$ p_r(x,t) = A_r e^{i(\omega t + k_a x)} $$  
The transmitted wave in water ($x > 0$) is:  
$$ p_t(x,t) = A_t e^{i(\omega t - k_w x)} $$  
where $k_a = \omega / c_a$ and $k_w = \omega / c_w$ are wave numbers. The acoustic impedances are:  
$$ Z_a = \rho_a c_a, \quad Z_w = \rho_w c_w. $$  

**Step 2: Apply pressure continuity at $x = 0$**  
Total pressure just left of the interface (air side) equals pressure just right (water side):  
$$ p_i(0,t) + p_r(0,t) = p_t(0,t) $$  
$$ A_i e^{i\omega t} + A_r e^{i\omega t} = A_t e^{i\omega t} $$  
Dividing by $e^{i\omega t}$ (nonzero for all $t$):  
$$ A_i + A_r = A_t \quad (1) $$  

**Step 3: Apply particle velocity continuity at $x = 0$**  
The particle velocity $u$ relates to pressure via impedance. For a plane wave:  
- Incident wave: $ u_i = \frac{p_i}{Z_a} $ (positive $x$-direction).  
- Reflected wave: $ u_r = -\frac{p_r}{Z_a} $ (negative $x$-direction).  
- Transmitted wave: $ u_t = \frac{p_t}{Z_w} $ (positive $x$-direction).  
Continuity of particle velocity at $x = 0$:  
$$ u_i(0,t) + u_r(0,t) = u_t(0,t) $$  
$$ \frac{A_i e^{i\omega t}}{Z_a} - \frac{A_r e^{i\omega t}}{Z_a} = \frac{A_t e^{i\omega t}}{Z_w} $$  
Dividing by $e^{i\omega t}$:  
$$ \frac{A_i - A_r}{Z_a} = \frac{A_t}{Z_w} \quad (2) $$  

**Step 4: Solve equations for $R = A_r / A_i$**  
Substitute $A_t$ from (1) into (2):  
$$ \frac{A_i - A_r}{Z_a} = \frac{A_i + A_r}{Z_w} $$  
Cross-multiply:  
$$ Z_w (A_i - A_r) = Z_a (A_i + A_r) $$  
$$ Z_w A_i - Z_w A_r = Z_a A_i + Z_a A_r $$  
Group $A_i$ and $A_r$ terms:  
$$ Z_w A_i - Z_a A_i = Z_a A_r + Z_w A_r $$  
$$ A_i (Z_w - Z_a) = A_r (Z_a + Z_w) $$  
Solve for $R$:  
$$ R = \frac{A_r}{A_i} = \frac{Z_w - Z_a}{Z_a + Z_w} $$  
Substitute $Z_a = \rho_a c_a$ and $Z_w = \rho_w c_w$:  
$$ R = \frac{\rho_w c_w - \rho_a c_a}{\rho_a c_a + \rho_w c_w} $$  

**Step 5: Simplify the expression**  
The expression is already simplified. Thus:  
$$ R = \frac{\rho_w c_w - \rho_a c_a}{\rho_a c_a + \rho_w c_w} $$

## Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\rho_w c_w - \rho_a c_a}{\rho_a c_a + \rho_w c_w}}$$

## Problem 3
Background:
When a wave pulse travels along a string and encounters a boundary with a different string, part of the wave is reflected and part is transmitted. The behavior of the reflected pulse—specifically whether it is inverted (flipped vertically) or not—depends on the linear mass densities of the two strings. This phenomenon occurs because the boundary conditions at the junction require continuity of displacement and force. For transverse waves, the wave speed $v$ in a string under tension $T$ is given by $v = \sqrt{T / \mu}$, where $\mu$ is the linear mass density. The reflection coefficient, which determines the amplitude and phase of the reflected wave, is derived from these boundary conditions.

Knowledge Points Tested:
1. Wave propagation on strings and the wave equation
2. Boundary conditions at a discontinuity (continuity of displacement and derivative)
3. Derivation of reflection coefficients using harmonic wave analysis
4. Interpretation of the sign of the reflection coefficient for pulse inversion

Intradisciplinary Connections:
This problem connects to wave mechanics principles such as impedance (defined as $Z = \sqrt{\mu T}$ for strings), energy conservation in wave transmission/reflection, and the general framework for boundary value problems in physics.

Interdisciplinary Connections:
The mathematical approach (solving systems of equations from boundary conditions) applies to electrical engineering (transmission lines), acoustics (sound wave reflection at media interfaces), and optics (light reflection/refraction at dielectric boundaries).

Real-World Applications:
Understanding wave reflection is crucial in designing musical instruments (e.g., controlling harmonics in guitar strings), seismic wave analysis for earthquake engineering, and medical ultrasound imaging where reflections at tissue interfaces provide diagnostic information.

Problem Statement:
A wave pulse of amplitude $A_i$ travels from a string with linear mass density $\mu_1$ to a string with linear mass density $\mu_2$. Both strings are under the same tension $T$. Derive an expression for the reflection coefficient $r = A_r / A_i$, where $A_r$ is the amplitude of the reflected wave. Express $r$ in terms of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. Your derivation must:
- Start from the boundary conditions for displacement and slope continuity at the junction ($x = 0$).
- Use harmonic wave analysis (incident, reflected, and transmitted waves) to set up and solve the system of equations.
- Explicitly state the wave numbers $k_1$ and $k_2$ in terms of $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, and $T$.

Format the final answer as a single simplified fraction. Use $\sqrt{\ }$ for square roots and express all variables as given ($\mu_1$, $\mu_2$).

## Solution
**Step 1: Define wave functions**  
Assume harmonic waves (results apply to pulses via Fourier decomposition). The incident, reflected, and transmitted waves are:  
- Incident: $y_i(x,t) = A_i \sin(\omega t - k_1 x)$  
- Reflected: $y_r(x,t) = A_r \sin(\omega t + k_1 x)$  
- Transmitted: $y_t(x,t) = A_t \sin(\omega t - k_2 x)$  
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $k_1$, $k_2$ are wave numbers.  
Wave speeds: $v_1 = \sqrt{T / \mu_1}$, $v_2 = \sqrt{T / \mu_2}$.  
Wave numbers: $k_1 = \omega / v_1 = \omega \sqrt{\mu_1 / T}$, $k_2 = \omega / v_2 = \omega \sqrt{\mu_2 / T}$.  

**Step 2: Apply boundary conditions at $x = 0$**  
**Condition 1: Displacement continuity**  
At $x = 0$, displacement must be equal for both strings:  

$$
y_i(0,t) + y_r(0,t) = y_t(0,t)
$$
  
Substitute wave functions:  

$$
A_i \sin(\omega t) + A_r \sin(\omega t) = A_t \sin(\omega t)
$$
  
Divide by $\sin(\omega t)$ (assuming $\sin(\omega t) \neq 0$):  

$$
A_i + A_r = A_t \quad (1)
$$


**Condition 2: Slope continuity**  
The transverse force is $T \cdot \partial y / \partial x$. Force balance requires:  

$$
\left. \frac{\partial (y_i + y_r)}{\partial x} \right|_{x=0} = \left. \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial x} \right|_{x=0}
$$
  
Compute derivatives:  
- $\frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x} = -A_i k_1 \cos(\omega t - k_1 x)$ → at $x=0$: $-A_i k_1 \cos(\omega t)$  
- $\frac{\partial y_r}{\partial x} = A_r k_1 \cos(\omega t + k_1 x)$ → at $x=0$: $A_r k_1 \cos(\omega t)$  
- $\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial x} = -A_t k_2 \cos(\omega t - k_2 x)$ → at $x=0$: $-A_t k_2 \cos(\omega t)$  
Substitute into force balance:  

$$
-A_i k_1 \cos(\omega t) + A_r k_1 \cos(\omega t) = -A_t k_2 \cos(\omega t)
$$
  
Divide by $\cos(\omega t)$ (assuming $\cos(\omega t) \neq 0$):  

$$
-A_i k_1 + A_r k_1 = -A_t k_2 \quad (2)
$$


**Step 3: Solve the system of equations**  
From equation (1): $A_t = A_i + A_r$. Substitute into equation (2):  

$$
-k_1 A_i + k_1 A_r = -k_2 (A_i + A_r)
$$
  
Expand the right side:  

$$
-k_1 A_i + k_1 A_r = -k_2 A_i - k_2 A_r
$$
  
Bring all terms to the left:  

$$
-k_1 A_i + k_1 A_r + k_2 A_i + k_2 A_r = 0
$$
  
Group $A_i$ and $A_r$ terms:  

$$
A_i (-k_1 + k_2) + A_r (k_1 + k_2) = 0
$$
  
Solve for $A_r$:  

$$
A_r (k_1 + k_2) = A_i (k_1 - k_2)
$$
  

$$
A_r = A_i \frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2}
$$
  
Thus, the reflection coefficient is:  

$$
r = \frac{A_r}{A_i} = \frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2}
$$


**Step 4: Express in terms of $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$**  
Substitute $k_1 = \omega \sqrt{\mu_1 / T}$ and $k_2 = \omega \sqrt{\mu_2 / T}$:  

$$
r = \frac{\omega \sqrt{\mu_1 / T} - \omega \sqrt{\mu_2 / T}}{\omega \sqrt{\mu_1 / T} + \omega \sqrt{\mu_2 / T}} = \frac{\sqrt{\mu_1 / T} - \sqrt{\mu_2 / T}}{\sqrt{\mu_1 / T} + \sqrt{\mu_2 / T}}
$$
  
Factor out $1/\sqrt{T}$:  

$$
r = \frac{(1/\sqrt{T}) (\sqrt{\mu_1} - \sqrt{\mu_2})}{(1/\sqrt{T}) (\sqrt{\mu_1} + \sqrt{\mu_2})} = \frac{\sqrt{\mu_1} - \sqrt{\mu_2}}{\sqrt{\mu_1} + \sqrt{\mu_2}}
$$
  
This is the simplified form.  
**Note on inversion:** If $\mu_2 > \mu_1$, then $\sqrt{\mu_2} > \sqrt{\mu_1}$, so $r < 0$ (negative amplitude), meaning the reflected pulse is inverted.

$$\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{\mu_{1}} - \sqrt{\mu_{2}}}{\sqrt{\mu_{1}} + \sqrt{\mu_{2}}}}$$
