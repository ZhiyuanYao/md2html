## angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration

### Problem 0
##### Background
In mechanical systems, pulleys connected by belts are commonly used to transfer rotational motion. The linear displacement of the belt must be consistent across all pulleys in contact. A small pulley of radius $r$ is connected to a larger pulley of radius $R$ via a belt. When the small pulley rotates, it drives the larger pulley, but the angular displacements differ due to the radius ratio. Understanding this relationship requires converting angular units and applying fundamental kinematic principles.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conversion between degrees and radians.  
2. Relationship between linear displacement and angular displacement: $s = r \theta$ (where $\theta$ is in radians).  
3. Conservation of belt length: linear displacement is identical for both pulleys.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Rotational kinematics: connects angular displacement to linear motion through radius.  
- Geometry: arc length calculations rely on angular units.  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- Mechanical engineering: pulley systems are used in engines, conveyor belts, and elevators.  
- Robotics: precise angular control is essential for robotic arm movements.  

##### Real-World Applications
- Automotive timing belts: synchronize crankshaft and camshaft rotations in engines.  
- Factory conveyor systems: transfer rotational motion between shafts of different diameters.  

##### Problem Statement
A motor rotates a small pulley of radius $r$ by 150 degrees. This pulley drives a larger pulley of radius $R$ via a belt. Determine the angular displacement of the larger pulley in radians. Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $r$ and $R$.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Convert initial angular displacement to radians  
The small pulley's angular displacement is given as 150 degrees. To convert degrees to radians, use the conversion factor $\pi \text{ radians} = 180^\circ$:  
$$  
\theta_{\text{small}} = 150^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{150\pi}{180} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \text{ radians}.  
$$  

##### Step 2: Relate angular displacement to linear belt displacement  
The linear displacement $s$ of the belt is determined by the small pulley's rotation:  
$$  
s = r \cdot \theta_{\text{small}} = r \cdot \frac{5\pi}{6}.  
$$  
Since the belt is inextensible, this same linear displacement $s$ applies to the larger pulley.  

##### Step 3: Express larger pulley's angular displacement  
For the larger pulley, linear displacement $s$ relates to its angular displacement $\theta_{\text{large}}$ (in radians) and radius $R$:  
$$  
s = R \cdot \theta_{\text{large}}.  
$$  
Substitute $s$ from Step 2:  
$$  
R \cdot \theta_{\text{large}} = r \cdot \frac{5\pi}{6}.  
$$  

##### Step 4: Solve for $\theta_{\text{large}}$  
Isolate $\theta_{\text{large}}$:  
$$  
\theta_{\text{large}} = \frac{r}{R} \cdot \frac{5\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi r}{6R}.  
$$  
This is the angular displacement of the larger pulley in radians.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{5\pi r}{6R}}$$

### Problem 1
##### Background  
In aerospace engineering, satellite reaction wheels control orientation by changing rotational speed. Consider a reaction wheel that begins rotating at $\omega_0$ rad/s but experiences a deliberate angular acceleration decay to prevent overshoot. The angular acceleration follows $\alpha(t) = -\kappa \omega(t)$, where $\kappa$ is a positive constant, and $\omega(t)$ is the instantaneous angular velocity.  

##### Knowledge Points Tested  
1. Relationship between angular displacement ($\theta$), velocity ($\omega$), and acceleration ($\alpha$)  
2. Solving differential equations for rotational motion  
3. Definite integration of time-dependent angular velocity  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections  
- Connects to torque ($\tau = I\alpha$) in rotational dynamics  
- Extends to conservation of angular momentum when external torque is zero  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections  
- Aerospace: Attitude control systems in satellites  
- Control Theory: Exponential decay models in feedback systems  

##### Real-World Applications  
Reaction wheels in Hubble Space Telescope maintain precise pointing for astronomical observations. Acceleration decay prevents mechanical stress during maneuvers.  

##### Problem Statement  
The reaction wheel starts with initial angular velocity $\omega_0$ at $t=0$. Given $\alpha(t) = -\kappa \omega(t)$ where $\kappa$ is constant:  
1. Derive $\omega(t)$ as a function of $\omega_0$, $\kappa$, and $t$  
2. Find the total angular displacement $\Delta\theta$ between $t=0$ and $t=T$  
Express $\Delta\theta$ symbolically using only $\omega_0$, $\kappa$, and $T$.  
*Final answer must be an analytic expression in simplest form.*

### Solution
##### Step 1: Relate acceleration and velocity  
Angular acceleration is the derivative of angular velocity:  
$$\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}$$  
Substitute given acceleration model:  
$$\frac{d\omega}{dt} = -\kappa \omega$$  

##### Step 2: Solve the differential equation  
Separate variables and integrate:  
$$\int_{\omega_0}^{\omega} \frac{d\omega'}{\omega'} = -\kappa \int_0^t dt'$$  
Solve integrals:  
$$\ln \left| \frac{\omega}{\omega_0} \right| = -\kappa t$$  
Exponentiate both sides:  
$$\omega(t) = \omega_0 e^{-\kappa t}$$  

##### Step 3: Derive angular displacement  
Angular velocity is the derivative of displacement:  
$$\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt} \implies d\theta = \omega  dt$$  
Integrate from $t=0$ to $t=T$:  
$$\Delta\theta = \int_0^T \omega(t)  dt = \int_0^T \omega_0 e^{-\kappa t}  dt$$  

##### Step 4: Evaluate the integral  
Compute the definite integral:  
$$\Delta\theta = \omega_0 \left[ -\frac{1}{\kappa} e^{-\kappa t} \right]_0^T = \omega_0 \left( -\frac{e^{-\kappa T}}{\kappa} + \frac{1}{\kappa} \right)$$  
Simplify:  
$$\Delta\theta = \frac{\omega_0}{\kappa} \left( 1 - e^{-\kappa T} \right)$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\omega_{0}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa T}\right)}{\kappa}}$$

### Problem 10
##### Background
A wheel, modeled as a solid cylinder, is initially at rest on a horizontal surface. A constant horizontal force $F$ is applied at its center, causing it to roll without slipping. This scenario illustrates how forces induce rotational motion through torque and how constraints like rolling without slipping link linear and angular dynamics. The moment of inertia for a solid cylinder about its central axis is $I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2$, where $M$ is the mass and $R$ is the radius.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Newton's second law for linear motion ($\sum F = Ma$).
2. Newton's second law for rotational motion ($\sum \tau = I \alpha$).
3. Rolling without slipping constraint ($a = R \alpha$).
4. Kinematics of constant angular acceleration ($\theta = \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2$ for $\omega_0 = 0$).
5. Moment of inertia of symmetric bodies.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
Connects linear acceleration to angular acceleration via the rolling constraint, integrates force/torque relationships, and applies rotational kinematics—demonstrating how linear and rotational dynamics unify under mechanical constraints.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Relevant to mechanical engineering (vehicle drivetrain design), robotics (wheeled locomotion), and physics (energy methods in rigid-body dynamics).

##### Real-World Applications
- Automotive traction systems where forces applied to wheels induce rotation without skidding.
- Industrial conveyor systems using driven rollers to transport materials efficiently.
- Analysis of planetary rovers navigating terrain via controlled wheel torques.

##### Problem Statement
A solid cylindrical wheel of mass $M$ and radius $R$ starts from rest on a horizontal surface. A constant horizontal force $F$ is applied at its center, causing it to roll without slipping. Derive an expression for the angular displacement $\theta$ of the wheel after time $t$.  
Express $\theta$ symbolically in terms of $M$, $R$, $F$, $t$, and fundamental constants. Simplify the expression fully.  
*Reminder: The moment of inertia is $I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2$.*

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify forces and accelerations**  
The applied force $F$ acts horizontally at the center of mass. Friction $f$ acts at the contact point opposing motion (direction determined by rolling constraint).  
- Linear acceleration of center of mass: $a$ (horizontal).  
- Angular acceleration about center: $\alpha$.  

**Step 2: Apply Newton's second law**  
**Linear motion** (horizontal direction, positive in $F$'s direction):  
$$ F - f = M a \quad (1) $$  

**Rotational motion** (torque about center):  
Only friction provides torque: $\tau = f R$ (clockwise).  
$$ f R = I \alpha \quad (2) $$  
Substitute $I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2$:  
$$ f R = \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \alpha \implies f = \frac{1}{2} M R \alpha \quad (2\text{a}) $$  

**Step 3: Apply rolling constraint**  
Rolling without slipping requires:  
$$ a = R \alpha \quad (3) $$  

**Step 4: Solve for angular acceleration $\alpha$**  
Substitute (2a) and (3) into (1):  
$$ F - \left( \frac{1}{2} M R \alpha \right) = M (R \alpha) $$  
$$ F = M R \alpha + \frac{1}{2} M R \alpha = \frac{3}{2} M R \alpha $$  
$$ \alpha = \frac{2F}{3 M R} \quad (4) $$  

**Step 5: Derive angular displacement**  
Initial angular velocity $\omega_0 = 0$ (starts from rest). For constant $\alpha$:  
$$ \theta = \omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2 = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2F}{3 M R} \right) t^2 $$  
$$ \theta = \frac{F t^2}{3 M R} $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{F t^{2}}{3 M R}}$$

### Problem 11
##### Background
Ferris wheels are iconic amusement park rides that operate on principles of rotational motion. As the wheel rotates, each point on its rim experiences two accelerations: centripetal (radial) acceleration towards the center and tangential acceleration along the path. Tangential acceleration arises from changes in angular speed and directly affects how quickly riders' linear speed changes. This problem explores the physics of a Ferris wheel undergoing angular acceleration.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. **Tangential acceleration**: Derivation from angular acceleration and radius.
3. **Uniform angular acceleration**: Application of kinematic equations for rotational motion.
4. **Unit conversion**: Revolutions to radians for angular displacement.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- **Circular motion**: Tangential acceleration complements centripetal acceleration in analyzing rotational dynamics.
- **Kinematics**: Parallels between linear motion (displacement, velocity, acceleration) and rotational analogs.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Motor torque requirements for Ferris wheels depend on angular acceleration.
- **Transportation**: Similar acceleration principles apply to wheel dynamics in vehicles.

##### Real-World Applications

- **Industrial machinery**: Conveyor belts and rotating drums use these principles for speed control.

##### Problem Statement
A Ferris wheel of radius $R$ starts from rest and undergoes constant angular acceleration. It completes $N$ full revolutions in time $T$. Derive an expression for the tangential acceleration $a_t$ at the rim at any instant during this motion. Express your answer solely in terms of $R$, $N$, and $T$.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Relate angular displacement to given parameters
The angular displacement $\theta$ for $N$ revolutions is:

$$
\theta = 2\pi N \quad \text{(converting revolutions to radians)}
$$


##### Step 2: Apply angular kinematics equation
For constant angular acceleration starting from rest ($\omega_0 = 0$):

$$
\theta = \frac{1}{2} \alpha T^2
$$

Substitute $\theta = 2\pi N$:

$$
2\pi N = \frac{1}{2} \alpha T^2
$$


##### Step 3: Solve for angular acceleration $\alpha$
Rearrange the equation:

$$
\alpha = \frac{4\pi N}{T^2}
$$


##### Step 4: Relate tangential and angular acceleration
Tangential acceleration $a_t$ is given by:

$$
a_t = R \alpha
$$

Substitute $\alpha$:

$$
a_t = R \left( \frac{4\pi N}{T^2} \right) = \frac{4\pi N R}{T^2}
$$


##### Conclusion
The tangential acceleration at the rim is constant (due to uniform angular acceleration) and derived as $\frac{4\pi N R}{T^2}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{4\pi N R}{T^{2}}}$$

### Problem 12
##### Background
Flywheels are mechanical energy storage devices used in applications ranging from industrial machinery to electric vehicles. The motor driving a flywheel often has complex torque-speed characteristics. In this scenario, the motor's torque control system causes the angular acceleration to depend nonlinearly on the angular velocity.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Definition of angular acceleration as the time derivative of angular velocity: $\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}$.
2. Solving separable first-order differential equations.
3. Applying initial conditions to determine constants of integration.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects angular kinematics to calculus by requiring the integration of a time-dependent angular acceleration. It also demonstrates how rotational dynamics extends linear motion concepts to circular paths.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The differential equation solved here appears in control systems engineering (motor dynamics), fluid dynamics (viscous drag), and population biology (growth models), illustrating how similar mathematical structures arise across disciplines.

##### Real-World Applications
- Regenerative braking systems in electric vehicles, where motor torque is controlled based on wheel speed.
- Industrial centrifuges with acceleration profiles designed to minimize mechanical stress during startup.
- Energy storage flywheels in grid stabilization systems, where rotational speed governs power output.

##### Problem Statement
A flywheel is driven by a specialized motor that produces an angular acceleration $\alpha$ proportional to the square root of its instantaneous angular velocity $\omega$, such that $\alpha = \gamma \sqrt{\omega}$, where $\gamma$ is a positive constant. At time $t = 0$, the flywheel has an initial angular velocity $\omega_0$. Derive an expression for the angular velocity $\omega$ at time $t$. Express your answer in terms of $\gamma$, $\omega_0$, and $t$.

### Solution
Begin with the definition of angular acceleration:
$$\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}$$

Substitute the given relationship $\alpha = \gamma \sqrt{\omega}$:
$$\frac{d\omega}{dt} = \gamma \sqrt{\omega}$$

Separate variables to prepare for integration:
$$\frac{d\omega}{\sqrt{\omega}} = \gamma  dt$$

Express the left side as a power of $\omega$:
$$\omega^{-1/2}  d\omega = \gamma  dt$$

Integrate both sides. The left side is integrated with respect to $\omega$, and the right side with respect to $t$:
$$\int \omega^{-1/2}  d\omega = \gamma \int dt$$

Perform the integrations:
$$2 \omega^{1/2} = \gamma t + C$$
where $C$ is the constant of integration.

Apply the initial condition: at $t = 0$, $\omega = \omega_0$:
$$2 \sqrt{\omega_0} = \gamma (0) + C \implies C = 2 \sqrt{\omega_0}$$

Substitute $C$ back into the equation:
$$2 \sqrt{\omega} = \gamma t + 2 \sqrt{\omega_0}$$

Solve for $\sqrt{\omega}$:
$$\sqrt{\omega} = \frac{\gamma t}{2} + \sqrt{\omega_0}$$

Square both sides to solve for $\omega$:
$$\omega = \left( \frac{\gamma t}{2} + \sqrt{\omega_0} \right)^2$$

The expression for angular velocity at time $t$ is therefore:
$$\omega = \left( \sqrt{\omega_0} + \frac{\gamma t}{2} \right)^2$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\left( \sqrt{\omega_0} + \frac{\gamma t}{2} \right)^2}$$

### Problem 13
##### Background
Ceiling fans are common household appliances that rotate to circulate air. When turned off, they gradually slow down due to friction and air resistance. This deceleration is uniform if the retarding torque is constant. Understanding angular motion parameters like deceleration is essential for designing efficient motor systems and predicting stopping times in rotating machinery.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Unit conversion: revolutions per minute (rpm) to radians per second (rad/s).
2. Kinematic equations for uniformly decelerated rotational motion.
3. Magnitude calculation of angular deceleration.
4. Symbolic manipulation of rotational dynamics equations.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to linear kinematics through analogous equations (e.g., $v = u + at$ vs. $\omega_f = \omega_i + \alpha t$).
- Relates to torque and moment of inertia in rotational dynamics, where $\tau = I\alpha$.
- Extends to energy methods (rotational kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$) for power dissipation analysis.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering:** Motor design and braking systems in appliances/electric vehicles require precise deceleration control.
- **Aerodynamics:** Air resistance on fan blades involves fluid dynamics principles.
- **Control Systems:** Feedback mechanisms for maintaining constant speed or soft-stop features.

##### Real-World Applications

- **Automotive:** Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and regenerative braking in electric vehicles.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Optimizing battery life in cordless tools by modeling deceleration profiles.

##### Problem Statement
A ceiling fan initially rotating at 120 revolutions per minute (rpm) decelerates uniformly and comes to rest after 15 seconds. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the angular deceleration ($\alpha$) in rad/s². Use the following symbols:  
- $\omega_i$ for initial angular velocity in rpm,  
- $t$ for time in seconds.  
Express $\alpha$ symbolically in terms of $\omega_i$ and $t$. Simplify the expression maximally.  
**Instructions for final answer:**  
- Provide only the simplified analytic expression.  
- Use $\pi$ for the circle constant.  
- Do not include units or numerical substitutions.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Convert initial angular velocity to rad/s
The initial angular velocity is given in rpm. Convert to rad/s:  
- 1 revolution = $2\pi$ radians,  
- 1 minute = 60 seconds.  
Thus:  

$$
\omega_{\text{rad}} = \omega_i \left(\frac{\text{rev}}{\text{min}}\right) \times \frac{2\pi \, \text{rad}}{1 \, \text{rev}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{min}}{60 \, \text{s}} = \frac{\omega_i \cdot 2\pi}{60} = \frac{\omega_i \pi}{30} \, \text{rad/s}.
$$


##### Step 2: Apply the kinematic equation for uniform deceleration
The final angular velocity ($\omega_f$) is 0 rad/s (rest). For uniform deceleration:  

$$
\omega_f = \omega_{\text{rad}} + \alpha t,
$$
  
where $\alpha$ is angular acceleration (negative for deceleration). Substitute known values:  

$$
0 = \frac{\omega_i \pi}{30} + \alpha t.
$$


##### Step 3: Solve for angular acceleration
Rearrange to isolate $\alpha$:  

$$
\alpha t = -\frac{\omega_i \pi}{30} \implies \alpha = -\frac{\omega_i \pi}{30t}.
$$
  
The magnitude of angular deceleration is the absolute value:  

$$
|\alpha| = \frac{\omega_i \pi}{30t}.
$$


##### Step 4: Simplify the expression
The expression $\frac{\omega_i \pi}{30t}$ is already simplified. This is the symbolic form of the angular deceleration magnitude.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\omega_i \pi}{30t}}$$

### Problem 14
##### Background
A bicycle wheel rotates about its central axis. The wheel has a diameter $d$, meaning its radius $r = d/2$. Centripetal acceleration $a_c$ is experienced by points on the wheel's edge due to rotational motion. Centripetal acceleration arises from the change in direction of velocity and depends on the angular velocity of rotation.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

- Connection between diameter and radius: $r = d/2$.
- Algebraic manipulation to solve for angular velocity $\omega$.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

- Circular motion: Centripetal acceleration is perpendicular to tangential velocity and directed toward the center.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering:** Wheel design in vehicles requires understanding rotational dynamics to ensure structural integrity.
- **Sports science:** Analysis of cycling performance involves angular velocity and centripetal forces on wheels.

##### Real-World Applications
- **Bicycle safety:** Excessive centripetal acceleration at high speeds can cause wheel deformation or failure.
- **Amusement rides:** Ferris wheels and carousels rely on controlled angular velocity to maintain safe centripetal acceleration for riders.

##### Problem Statement
A bicycle wheel of diameter $d$ rotates about its axis. The centripetal acceleration at the edge of the wheel is $a_c$. Derive an expression for the angular velocity $\omega$ of the wheel in terms of $d$ and $a_c$.  
Express your answer symbolically using the variables $d$ and $a_c$.

### Solution
The centripetal acceleration $a_c$ at a distance $r$ from the axis of rotation is given by:  
$$ a_c = r \omega^2 $$  
where $\omega$ is the angular velocity.  

The radius $r$ of the wheel is half the diameter $d$:  
$$ r = \frac{d}{2} $$  

Substitute the expression for $r$ into the centripetal acceleration equation:  
$$ a_c = \left( \frac{d}{2} \right) \omega^2 $$  

Solve for $\omega^2$:  
$$ \omega^2 = \frac{2a_c}{d} $$  

Take the positive square root to find $\omega$ (since angular velocity is non-negative):  
$$ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{2a_c}{d}} $$  

Thus, the angular velocity $\omega$ is $\sqrt{\frac{2a_c}{d}}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{2a_c}{d}}}$$

------
### Problem 15
##### Background
Flywheels are mechanical energy storage devices that rotate about a fixed axis, commonly used in engines, industrial machinery, and power grid stabilization systems. Their ability to maintain rotational inertia makes them ideal for smoothing out torque fluctuations. This problem explores the kinematics of a uniformly accelerating flywheel, requiring you to derive its angular acceleration from fundamental principles of rotational motion.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Rotational kinematics equations for constant angular acceleration
3. Algebraic manipulation to solve for angular acceleration without time dependence
4. Simplification of exact symbolic expressions

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

1. Diesel-electric locomotives during acceleration/deceleration
2. Satellite attitude control systems
3. Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) for data centers
4. Formula 1 hybrid powertrains (energy recovery under braking)

##### Problem Statement
A flywheel undergoes uniform angular acceleration while completing exactly 50 revolutions. Its angular velocity increases from $5  \text{rad/s}$ to $20  \text{rad/s}$ during this motion. Derive an exact expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha$ in terms of $\pi$, simplified to lowest terms. Use the following steps:  
1. Convert angular displacement to SI units.  
2. Apply the appropriate rotational kinematics equation that relates initial angular velocity $\omega_i$, final angular velocity $\omega_f$, angular displacement $\theta$, and angular acceleration $\alpha$ without time dependence.  
3. Solve algebraically for $\alpha$.  
4. Simplify the expression to lowest terms.  

**Answer Format Requirements**:  
- Express $\alpha$ as a single fraction involving $\pi$.  
- Simplify all coefficients to lowest integer terms.  
- Use $\frac{a}{b}$ notation for fractions.  
- Do not evaluate numerically or include units in the final answer box.

### Solution
**Step 1: Convert angular displacement**  
Given: $\theta = 50$ revolutions.  
Since $1  \text{revolution} = 2\pi  \text{radians}$:  

$$
\theta = 50 \times 2\pi = 100\pi  \text{rad}
$$


**Step 2: Apply rotational kinematics equation**  
For constant angular acceleration, the time-independent equation is:  

$$
\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta
$$
  
Given:  
- Initial angular velocity $\omega_i = 5  \text{rad/s}$  
- Final angular velocity $\omega_f = 20  \text{rad/s}$  

**Step 3: Solve for $\alpha$**  
Substitute known values into the equation:  

$$
(20)^2 = (5)^2 + 2\alpha(100\pi)
$$
  

$$
400 = 25 + 200\pi\alpha
$$
  
Isolate $\alpha$:  

$$
400 - 25 = 200\pi\alpha
$$
  

$$
375 = 200\pi\alpha
$$
  

$$
\alpha = \frac{375}{200\pi}
$$


**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 25:  

$$
\frac{375 \div 25}{200 \div 25} = \frac{15}{8}
$$
  
Thus:  

$$
\alpha = \frac{15}{8\pi}
$$
  
This is the exact expression simplified to lowest terms.

### Answer
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{15}{8\pi}}
\]

### Problem 16
##### Background
In automotive engineering, the motion of a wheel is analyzed using rotational kinematics. When a vehicle moves at a constant speed, its wheels roll without slipping. This means the distance traveled by the vehicle equals the arc length unrolled by the tire. The relationship between the vehicle's linear speed and the tire's rotational motion is fundamental to designing speedometers, traction control systems, and anti-lock braking systems (ABS).

##### Knowledge Points Tested

##### Problem Statement
A car moves in a straight line at a constant linear speed $v$. Its tires have radius $R$ and roll without slipping on the road. Derive an expression for the angular velocity $\omega$ of the tires in terms of $v$ and $R$. Justify each step using the rolling-without-slipping condition and fundamental kinematic equations.

### Solution
To derive the angular velocity $\omega$, follow these steps:

1. **State the rolling-without-slipping condition**:  
   When a wheel rolls without slipping, the linear distance traveled by the center of the wheel equals the arc length unrolled from its circumference. For one full revolution:
   
$$
   \text{Linear distance} = \text{Circumference}
   $$

   
$$
   \Delta s = 2\pi R
   $$

   where $\Delta s$ is the distance traveled and $R$ is the tire radius.

2. **Relate linear distance to time**:  
   Let $T$ be the time for one full revolution (period of rotation). The linear speed $v$ is:
   
$$
   v = \frac{\Delta s}{T} = \frac{2\pi R}{T}
   $$


3. **Define angular velocity**:  
   Angular velocity $\omega$ is the angle swept per unit time. For one full revolution ($2\pi$ radians):
   
$$
   \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}
   $$


4. **Combine equations to eliminate $T$**:  
   Solve for $T$ in the angular velocity equation:
   
$$
   T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
   $$

   Substitute into the linear speed equation:
   
$$
   v = \frac{2\pi R}{\left( \frac{2\pi}{\omega} \right)} = \frac{2\pi R \omega}{2\pi}
   $$

   Simplify:
   
$$
   v = R \omega
   $$


5. **Solve for $\omega$**:  
   Rearrange the equation:
   
$$
   \omega = \frac{v}{R}
   $$


**Conclusion**:  
The angular velocity $\omega$ is derived as $\frac{v}{R}$ by enforcing the rolling-without-slipping condition and linking linear kinematics to rotational kinematics.

### Problem 17
##### Background
Rotational motion is a fundamental concept in physics, describing the movement of objects around a fixed axis. In many mechanical systems, such as braking disks in vehicles or spinning components in machinery, controlled deceleration is essential for safety and functionality. This problem involves analyzing the angular kinematics of a disk undergoing constant deceleration.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Equations for rotational motion with constant angular acceleration.
2. Relationship between angular displacement, angular velocity, and time.
3. Derivation of time from initial and final angular velocities and angular displacement.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to torque and moment of inertia (which cause angular acceleration) and to the broader study of rigid body dynamics. It also reinforces analogies between rotational and linear kinematics (e.g., angular displacement vs. linear displacement).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Rotational motion principles are applied in mechanical engineering (e.g., designing braking systems), aerospace (e.g., satellite attitude control), and robotics (e.g., controlling joint rotations). Understanding deceleration times is critical for optimizing performance and safety in these fields.

##### Real-World Applications

- **Industrial Machinery**: Determining slowdown periods for rotating saw blades or turbines to avoid damage.
- **Consumer Electronics**: Modeling spin-down times for hard disk drives during power loss.

##### Problem Statement
A disk rotates with an initial angular velocity of 8 rad/s. It experiences a constant angular deceleration and slows to a final angular velocity of 2 rad/s while rotating through an angular displacement of 30 radians. Derive an expression for the time elapsed during this deceleration, then compute its exact numerical value in seconds. Express your final answer as an exact number, providing only the numerical value without units.

*Note: Ensure all steps in your derivation use symbolic reasoning before substituting numerical values.*

### Solution
We are given:
- Initial angular velocity, $\omega_i = 8  \text{rad/s}$
- Final angular velocity, $\omega_f = 2  \text{rad/s}$
- Angular displacement, $\theta = 30  \text{rad}$

Assume constant angular acceleration $\alpha$ (negative for deceleration). The kinematic equations for rotational motion are:

1. $\omega_f = \omega_i + \alpha t$
2. $\theta = \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2$

We need to eliminate $\alpha$ to solve for time $t$. Solve Equation 1 for $\alpha$:


$$
\alpha = \frac{\omega_f - \omega_i}{t}
$$


Substitute this into Equation 2:


$$
\theta = \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\omega_f - \omega_i}{t} \right) t^2
$$


Simplify the expression:


$$
\theta = \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} (\omega_f - \omega_i) t
$$


Factor out $t$:


$$
\theta = t \left( \omega_i + \frac{\omega_f - \omega_i}{2} \right)
$$


Combine terms inside the parentheses:


$$
\theta = t \left( \frac{2\omega_i + \omega_f - \omega_i}{2} \right) = t \left( \frac{\omega_i + \omega_f}{2} \right)
$$


Thus, the time $t$ is:


$$
t = \frac{2\theta}{\omega_i + \omega_f}
$$


Now substitute the given numerical values:


$$
t = \frac{2 \times 30}{8 + 2} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
$$


The time elapsed is 6 seconds.

### Problem 18
##### Background
In a washing machine, the drum rotates at high speeds during the spin cycle to remove water from clothes through centrifugal force. The centripetal acceleration at the rim of the drum is a critical factor in the design, as it determines the force exerted on the clothes. Understanding this acceleration in terms of Earth's gravitational acceleration $g$ provides insight into the relative strength of the forces involved.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conversion of rotational speed from revolutions per minute (rpm) to angular velocity in radians per second.
2. Calculation of centripetal acceleration using angular velocity and radius.
3. Expression of physical quantities in terms of fundamental constants and given parameters.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- **Rotational Kinematics**: Relates angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
- **Circular Motion**: Centripetal acceleration arises from the change in direction of velocity in circular paths.
- **Units and Dimensions**: Ensures consistency in unit conversions and dimensional analysis.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Physics**: Demonstrates the principles of rotational dynamics and their application to everyday technology.

##### Real-World Applications

- **Centrifuges**: Used in medical and scientific laboratories to separate substances by density, relying on high centripetal accelerations.
- **Amusement Park Rides**: Rides like spinning platforms or roller coasters with circular sections require precise force calculations for safety.

##### Problem Statement
A washing machine drum rotates at a constant rotational speed of $N$ revolutions per minute (rpm). The inner radius of the drum is $R$. Derive an expression for the centripetal acceleration, $a$, at the rim of the drum. Express $a$ as a multiple of Earth's gravitational acceleration $g$, i.e., in the form $a = (\text{expression}) \cdot g$. Use the symbols $N$, $R$, and $g$ in your expression. Ensure your final answer is simplified and explicitly includes $g$.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Convert Rotational Speed to Angular Velocity
The rotational speed is given as $N$ revolutions per minute (rpm). To find the angular velocity $\omega$ in radians per second:
- There are $2\pi$ radians in one revolution.
- There are 60 seconds in one minute.
Thus, the angular velocity $\omega$ is:
$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi N}{60} = \frac{\pi N}{30}  \text{rad/s}.
$$

##### Step 2: Derive Centripetal Acceleration
The centripetal acceleration $a$ for a point at radius $R$ moving with angular velocity $\omega$ is given by:
$$
a = \omega^2 R.
$$
Substitute the expression for $\omega$ from Step 1:
$$
a = \left( \frac{\pi N}{30} \right)^2 R = \frac{\pi^2 N^2}{900} R.
$$

##### Step 3: Express in Terms of $g$
To express $a$ as a multiple of $g$, write:
$$
a = \left( \frac{\pi^2 N^2 R}{900 g} \right) \cdot g.
$$
This explicitly shows $a$ as a product of a dimensionless factor and $g$. The expression is now in the required form, where the factor $\frac{\pi^2 N^2 R}{900 g}$ depends on the given parameters.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\pi^{2} N^{2} R}{900 g} \cdot g}$$

### Problem 19
##### Background
A conical pendulum consists of a mass (like a stone) attached to a string that moves in a horizontal circular path. The string traces out a cone, maintaining a constant angle with the vertical. This setup is commonly observed in physics demonstrations and has applications in centrifuges and amusement park rides, where rotational motion must be analyzed.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Relationship between tangential speed, angular velocity, and radius in circular motion.
2. Geometric derivation of the radius of the circular path in a conical pendulum.
3. Conversion of rotational kinematics (revolutions and time) to angular velocity.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

- **Amusement Rides**: Swinging pendulum rides (e.g., "Pirate Ship") use similar dynamics for pendulum-based motion.

##### Problem Statement
A stone tied to a string of length $L$ is whirled as a conical pendulum. The string makes a constant angle $\theta$ (in radians) with the vertical. The stone completes $N$ revolutions in time $T$. Derive an expression for the tangential speed $v$ of the stone in terms of $L$, $\theta$, $N$, and $T$. Ensure all trigonometric functions are left unevaluated (e.g., $\sin(\theta)$).

### Solution
##### Step-by-Step Derivation

**Step 1: Find the angular velocity $\omega$**  
The stone completes $N$ revolutions in time $T$. Each revolution corresponds to $2\pi$ radians. Thus, the total angular displacement is $2\pi N$ radians. The angular velocity $\omega$ is the rate of change of angular displacement:  
$$ \omega = \frac{\text{Total angular displacement}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2\pi N}{T}. $$

**Step 2: Determine the radius $r$ of the circular path**  
In a conical pendulum, the string of length $L$ sweeps a cone. The radius $r$ of the horizontal circular path is the horizontal component of the string. From geometry:  
$$ r = L \sin(\theta). $$

**Step 3: Relate tangential speed $v$ to angular velocity $\omega$ and radius $r$**  
Tangential speed $v$ is the linear speed along the circular path and is given by:  
$$ v = r \omega. $$  
Substitute the expressions for $r$ and $\omega$ from Steps 1 and 2:  
$$ v = \left( L \sin(\theta) \right) \left( \frac{2\pi N}{T} \right). $$  
Simplify to obtain the final expression:  
$$ v = \frac{2\pi L N \sin(\theta)}{T}. $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{2\pi L N \sin(\theta)}{T}}$$

##### Background

##### Problem Statement
A rotating space habitat simulator starts from rest at $ t = 0 $. Its angular acceleration increases linearly with time according to $ \alpha(t) = kt $, where $ k $ is a constant. At time $ t = T $, the angular velocity is measured to be $ \omega_f $.  

Determine the constant $ k $ in terms of measurable quantities. Then derive an expression for the angular displacement $ \theta $ of the simulator during the time interval $ [0, T] $. Express your final answer for $ \theta $ exclusively in terms of $ \omega_f $ and $ T $.

### Solution
**Step 1: Derive angular velocity from acceleration**  
Angular acceleration is the time derivative of angular velocity:  
$$ \alpha(t) = \frac{d\omega}{dt} = kt $$  
Integrate with respect to time from $ 0 $ to $ t $:  
$$ \int_0^\omega d\omega = \int_0^t kt'  dt' $$  
$$ \Rightarrow \omega(t) - \omega(0) = k \left[ \frac{t'^2}{2} \right]_0^t $$  
Initial condition: $ \omega(0) = 0 $ (starts from rest)  
$$ \omega(t) = \frac{k t^2}{2} \quad (1) $$  

**Step 2: Solve for $ k $ using given condition**  
At $ t = T $, $ \omega(T) = \omega_f $:  
$$ \omega_f = \frac{k T^2}{2} $$  
$$ \Rightarrow k = \frac{2\omega_f}{T^2} \quad (2) $$  

**Step 3: Derive angular displacement from velocity**  
Angular velocity is the time derivative of angular displacement:  
$$ \omega(t) = \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{k t^2}{2} $$  
Substitute $ k $ from (2):  
$$ \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2\omega_f}{T^2} \right) t^2 = \frac{\omega_f}{T^2} t^2 $$  
Integrate with respect to time from $ 0 $ to $ T $:  
$$ \int_0^\theta d\theta = \int_0^T \frac{\omega_f}{T^2} t^2  dt $$  
$$ \Rightarrow \theta - \theta(0) = \frac{\omega_f}{T^2} \left[ \frac{t^3}{3} \right]_0^T $$  
Initial condition: $ \theta(0) = 0 $  
$$ \theta = \frac{\omega_f}{T^2} \cdot \frac{T^3}{3} = \frac{\omega_f T}{3} $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\omega_f T}{3}}$$

### Problem 20
##### Background
In the quality control testing of an electric bicycle's braking system, engineers analyze the rotational motion of the wheels. When brakes are applied, friction generates torque that causes angular deceleration. Understanding this deceleration is critical for evaluating stopping performance and safety compliance. In a controlled test, the rear wheel's angular velocity decreases uniformly from an initial value to a final value over a specific angular displacement.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Application of rotational kinematics equations for constant angular acceleration.
- Derivation of angular acceleration using the relationship between angular velocity and displacement.
- Interpretation of deceleration as the magnitude of negative angular acceleration.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to linear kinematics ($v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a d$) through analogous rotational equations.
- Relates to torque and moment of inertia in dynamics, which govern angular acceleration.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Essential for designing braking systems in vehicles and industrial machinery.
- **Robotics**: Used in control algorithms for precise rotational motion of joints and wheels.

##### Real-World Applications
- Automotive safety testing: Calculating deceleration rates ensures brakes meet regulatory standards.
- Manufacturing: Optimizing stopping distances in conveyor systems or rotating equipment enhances efficiency and safety.

##### Problem Statement
During a braking test, a bicycle wheel decelerates uniformly from an initial angular velocity of $\omega_i = 7$ rad/s to a final angular velocity of $\omega_f = 2$ rad/s. This occurs over an angular displacement of $\theta = 15$ radians. Derive an expression for the angular deceleration (defined as the magnitude of the angular acceleration) in terms of $\omega_i$, $\omega_f$, and $\theta$. Then, compute its numerical value.

**Final Answer Requirements:**
- Derive the expression symbolically.
- Substitute the given values to find the numerical result.
- Express the final answer as an exact fraction (no units).
- Box only the numerical value.

### Solution
We use the kinematic equation for rotational motion under constant angular acceleration:

$$
\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2 \alpha \theta
$$

where:
- $\omega_i$ is the initial angular velocity,
- $\omega_f$ is the final angular velocity,
- $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration (which will be negative for deceleration),
- $\theta$ is the angular displacement.

Solving for $\alpha$:

$$
2 \alpha \theta = \omega_f^2 - \omega_i^2
$$


$$
\alpha = \frac{\omega_f^2 - \omega_i^2}{2 \theta}
$$


This is the general expression for angular acceleration. Since the problem defines angular deceleration as the magnitude of angular acceleration, we take the absolute value:

$$
\text{angular deceleration} = \left| \alpha \right| = \left| \frac{\omega_f^2 - \omega_i^2}{2 \theta} \right|
$$


Now substitute the given values:
- $\omega_i = 7$ rad/s,
- $\omega_f = 2$ rad/s,
- $\theta = 15$ radians.

First, compute $\alpha$:

$$
\alpha = \frac{(2)^2 - (7)^2}{2 \times 15} = \frac{4 - 49}{30} = \frac{-45}{30} = -\frac{3}{2} \text{ rad/s}^2
$$


The angular deceleration is the magnitude:

$$
\left| \alpha \right| = \left| -\frac{3}{2} \right| = \frac{3}{2} \text{ rad/s}^2
$$


The numerical value of the angular deceleration is $\frac{3}{2}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{3}{2}}$$

### Problem 21
##### Background
In vintage record players, turntables rotate at precise speeds to play vinyl records correctly. When switching between speeds, the turntable accelerates uniformly to avoid damaging the record. This problem explores the angular acceleration during such a speed change.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conversion of angular velocity between revolutions per minute (rpm) and radians per second (rad/s).  
2. Definition of constant angular acceleration.  
3. Application of kinematic equations for rotational motion under uniform acceleration.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects rotational kinematics to linear kinematics through analogous equations (e.g., $\alpha = \Delta\omega / \Delta t$ mirrors $a = \Delta v / \Delta t$). It reinforces the concept of uniform acceleration across motion types.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Angular acceleration calculations are vital in engineering disciplines:  
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Designing motor control systems for turntables, drones, or electric vehicles.  
- **Robotics**: Ensuring precise joint rotations in robotic arms.  
- **Aerospace**: Controlling the spin stabilization of satellites.  

##### Real-World Applications
- **Audio Technology**: Turntables require specific angular accelerations to transition between standard speeds (e.g., 33⅓ rpm to 45 rpm) without causing audible distortion or record wear.  
- **Industrial Systems**: Conveyor belts, centrifuges, and wind turbines rely on controlled angular acceleration for efficient operation.  
- **Everyday Devices**: Washing machine spin cycles and computer hard drives use similar principles for speed changes.  

##### Problem Statement
A turntable accelerates uniformly from an initial angular speed of $\omega_i$ revolutions per minute (rpm) to a final angular speed of $\omega_f$ rpm over a time interval of $t$ seconds. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha$ in radians per second squared (rad/s²). Express your answer symbolically in terms of $\omega_i$, $\omega_f$, $t$, and the constant $\pi$.  

**Answer Format Instructions**:  
- Provide only a single closed-form analytic expression.  
- Use $\pi$ for the mathematical constant pi.  
- Do not substitute numerical values or simplify constants.

### Solution
**Step 1: Convert initial angular velocity to rad/s**  
The initial angular velocity $\omega_i$ is given in rpm. Convert to rad/s:  
- 1 revolution = $2\pi$ radians, so multiply by $2\pi$.  
- 1 minute = 60 seconds, so divide by 60.  
The conversion factor is $\frac{2\pi}{60} = \frac{\pi}{30}$. Thus:  

$$
\omega_{i,\text{rad/s}} = \omega_i \times \frac{\pi}{30}
$$


**Step 2: Convert final angular velocity to rad/s**  
Similarly, for the final angular velocity $\omega_f$:  

$$
\omega_{f,\text{rad/s}} = \omega_f \times \frac{\pi}{30}
$$


**Step 3: Apply the definition of angular acceleration**  
Angular acceleration $\alpha$ is the rate of change of angular velocity. For uniform acceleration:  

$$
\alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \frac{\omega_{f,\text{rad/s}} - \omega_{i,\text{rad/s}}}{t}
$$
  
Substitute the expressions from Steps 1 and 2:  

$$
\alpha = \frac{ \left( \omega_f \frac{\pi}{30} \right) - \left( \omega_i \frac{\pi}{30} \right) }{t} = \frac{ \frac{\pi}{30} (\omega_f - \omega_i) }{t}
$$


**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
Factor out constants:  

$$
\alpha = \frac{\pi (\omega_f - \omega_i)}{30 t}
$$
  
This is the angular acceleration in rad/s².

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\pi \left( \omega_f - \omega_i \right)}{30 t}}$$

------
### Problem 22
##### Background
In rotational mechanics, the motion of a rigid body can be described using angular quantities. Consider a disk rotating about a fixed axis through its center. A point on the rim of the disk moves in a circular path with a radius equal to the disk's radius. Tangential acceleration describes the rate of change of the tangential speed, while angular acceleration quantifies how rapidly the angular velocity changes.  

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Relationship between tangential acceleration $a_t$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$  
- Definition of angular acceleration  
- Circular motion kinematics  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections  
This problem connects to torque and moment of inertia (dynamics of rotation), centripetal acceleration (uniform circular motion), and angular velocity (kinematics).  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections  
Rotational motion principles apply to engineering (e.g., designing flywheels in engines), astronomy (celestial body rotation), and biomechanics (joint movements).  

##### Real-World Applications  
Understanding angular acceleration is essential in devices like hard drives (disk rotation speed control), amusement park rides (e.g., spinning platforms), and industrial machinery (conveyor belt systems).  

##### Problem Statement  
A disk of radius $R$ rotates about its central axis. At a specific instant, a point on the rim experiences a tangential acceleration $a_t$. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the disk in terms of $R$ and $a_t$.

### Solution
The tangential acceleration $a_t$ of a point on the rim is related to the angular acceleration $\alpha$ through the radius $R$.  

**Step 1: Define tangential acceleration**  
Tangential acceleration is the rate of change of tangential velocity $v_t$:  
$$ a_t = \frac{dv_t}{dt} $$  

**Step 2: Relate tangential velocity to angular velocity**  
The tangential velocity $v_t$ is given by:  
$$ v_t = R \omega $$  
where $\omega$ is the angular velocity and $R$ is the radius.  

**Step 3: Substitute and differentiate**  
Substitute $v_t = R \omega$ into the expression for $a_t$:  
$$ a_t = \frac{d}{dt}(R \omega) $$  
Since $R$ is constant:  
$$ a_t = R \frac{d\omega}{dt} $$  

**Step 4: Define angular acceleration**  
Angular acceleration $\alpha$ is the rate of change of angular velocity:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt} $$  
Thus:  
$$ a_t = R \alpha $$  

**Step 5: Solve for angular acceleration**  
Rearrange to isolate $\alpha$:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{a_t}{R} $$  

This expression gives the angular acceleration in terms of the tangential acceleration and radius.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{a_t}{R}}$$

##### Problem Statement
A laboratory centrifuge rotor starts from rest ($\omega_0 = 0$) and accelerates uniformly. It completes exactly 200 revolutions while reaching a final angular velocity of $\omega = 100  \text{rad/s}$. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the rotor. Express your answer as an exact analytic expression in simplest form. Do not substitute numerical values for constants.  

**Answer format requirements:**  
- Use $\pi$ for the circle constant.  
- Express fractions as $\frac{a}{b}$.  
- The final expression must be simplified.

### Solution
**Step 1: Convert angular displacement to radians**  
The angular displacement $\theta$ is given in revolutions. Since $1  \text{revolution} = 2\pi  \text{radians}$:  

$$
\theta = 200 \times 2\pi = 400\pi  \text{radians}.
$$


**Step 2: Apply the rotational kinematics equation**  
The equation relating angular velocity, initial angular velocity, angular acceleration, and angular displacement is:  

$$
\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha\theta.
$$
  
Substitute $\omega_0 = 0$, $\omega = 100  \text{rad/s}$, and $\theta = 400\pi  \text{rad}$:  

$$
(100)^2 = (0)^2 + 2\alpha(400\pi).
$$


**Step 3: Solve for angular acceleration $\alpha$**  
Simplify the equation:  

$$
10000 = 800\pi \alpha.
$$
  
Isolate $\alpha$:  

$$
\alpha = \frac{10000}{800\pi}.
$$
  
Simplify the fraction:  

$$
\alpha = \frac{10000 \div 100}{800 \div 100} \cdot \frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{100}{8\pi} = \frac{25}{2\pi}.
$$
  
The expression $\frac{25}{2\pi}$ is in simplest form.

**Conclusion**

##### Problem Statement
A laboratory flywheel decelerates uniformly from an initial angular velocity $\omega_i$ to a final angular velocity $\omega_f$ over a time interval $t$. Derive a closed-form expression for the total angular displacement $\theta$ undergone by the flywheel during this deceleration. Express your answer solely in terms of $\omega_i$, $\omega_f$, and $t$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify fundamental equations**  
For constant angular acceleration $\alpha$, the kinematic equations are:  
$$\omega_f = \omega_i + \alpha t \quad (1)$$  
$$\theta = \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2 \quad (2)$$  

**Step 2: Solve for angular acceleration**  
Rearrange equation (1) to isolate $\alpha$:  
$$\alpha = \frac{\omega_f - \omega_i}{t}$$  

**Step 3: Substitute into displacement equation**  
Insert the expression for $\alpha$ into equation (2):  
$$\theta = \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\omega_f - \omega_i}{t} \right) t^2$$  

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
$$\theta = \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} (\omega_f - \omega_i) t$$  
$$\theta = \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} \omega_f t - \frac{1}{2} \omega_i t$$  
$$\theta = \left( \omega_i - \frac{1}{2} \omega_i \right) t + \frac{1}{2} \omega_f t$$  
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2} \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} \omega_f t$$  
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2} (\omega_i + \omega_f) t$$  

**Verification via independent method**  
Using the kinematic equation independent of acceleration:  
$$\theta = \left( \frac{\omega_i + \omega_f}{2} \right) t$$  
This matches the derived result, confirming consistency.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2} \left( \omega_i + \omega_f \right) t}$$

### Problem 25
##### Background
In circular motion, the total acceleration of a particle arises from two perpendicular components: tangential acceleration (due to changing speed) and centripetal acceleration (due to changing direction). This concept is essential in analyzing systems ranging from rotating machinery to planetary orbits.  

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Vector composition of tangential and centripetal accelerations  
- Relationship between angular/linear kinematics: $a_t = r \alpha$, $a_c = r \omega^2$  
- Magnitude calculation for perpendicular vectors: $a = \sqrt{a_t^2 + a_c^2}$  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
Connects to rotational dynamics (torque, moment of inertia) and harmonic motion, where angular acceleration and velocity govern oscillatory behavior.  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering:** Critical in designing centrifuges, turbines, and vehicle stability systems.  
- **Astronomy:** Models non-uniform circular motion in celestial mechanics (e.g., elliptical orbits).  

##### Real-World Applications

- **Industrial Machinery:** Determines stress limits on rotating components like flywheels or robotic arms under angular acceleration.  

##### Problem Statement  
A particle undergoes circular motion with radius $r$, angular velocity $\omega$, and angular acceleration $\alpha$. Derive an expression for the magnitude of its total acceleration $a$. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $r$, $\omega$, and $\alpha$.

### Solution
The total acceleration $\vec{a}$ has perpendicular components:  
1. **Tangential acceleration** $a_t$ (changes speed magnitude):  

$$
a_t = r \alpha
$$
  
2. **Centripetal acceleration** $a_c$ (changes velocity direction):  

$$
a_c = r \omega^2
$$
  
Since $a_t$ and $a_c$ are orthogonal, the magnitude $a$ is:  

$$
a = \sqrt{a_t^2 + a_c^2}
$$
  
Substitute the expressions for $a_t$ and $a_c$:  

$$
a = \sqrt{(r \alpha)^2 + (r \omega^2)^2}
$$
  
Factor out $r^2$:  

$$
a = \sqrt{r^2 \alpha^2 + r^2 \omega^4} = \sqrt{r^2 (\alpha^2 + \omega^4)}
$$
  
Simplify (noting $r > 0$):  

$$
a = r \sqrt{\alpha^2 + \omega^4}
$$
  
Thus, the magnitude of the total acceleration is $r \sqrt{\alpha^2 + \omega^4}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{r \sqrt{\alpha^{2} + \omega^{4}}}$$

### Problem 26
##### Background
Spinning tops are fascinating toys that exhibit rotational motion. When set spinning, they gradually slow down due to friction and air resistance, providing a practical example of angular deceleration. In this problem, we analyze the motion of a top that starts with a given angular velocity and decelerates at a constant rate. The goal is to determine how long it takes to complete a specific angular displacement—two full revolutions—before coming to a complete stop.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Kinematic equations for rotational motion with constant angular acceleration.
2. Solving quadratic equations arising from displacement-time relationships.
3. Physical interpretation of mathematical solutions in rotational contexts.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects rotational kinematics to linear kinematics through analogous equations of motion (e.g., displacement, velocity, and acceleration relationships). It also reinforces the concept of angular displacement in circular motion and its relation to revolutions.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Rotational deceleration models appear in mechanical engineering (e.g., braking systems in rotating machinery) and aerospace engineering (e.g., spin stabilization of satellites). The mathematics involved (quadratic equations) overlaps with algebra and calculus.

##### Real-World Applications
Understanding the deceleration of rotating objects is crucial for designing mechanical systems like flywheels, centrifuges, and gyroscopes. It also applies to everyday objects such as merry-go-rounds, ceiling fans, and sports equipment (e.g., discus throw).

##### Problem Statement
A spinning top has an initial angular velocity $\omega_0$ and experiences a constant angular deceleration of magnitude $\alpha$. Determine the time $t$ it takes for the top to complete exactly two full revolutions (an angular displacement of $4\pi$ radians) before it stops. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $\omega_0$, $\alpha$, and $\pi$.

**Answer Format Requirements:**
- Your answer must be an analytic expression using $\omega_0$, $\alpha$, and $\pi$.
- Use $\sqrt{\cdots}$ for square roots and $\pi$ for the mathematical constant.
- Do not substitute numerical values or include units in the final expression.

### Solution
The top starts with an initial angular velocity $\omega_0$ and decelerates at a constant rate $\alpha$. The angular acceleration is therefore $-\alpha$ (negative because it opposes the motion). The angular displacement $\theta$ for two revolutions is $4\pi$ radians. We use the kinematic equation for rotational motion with constant angular acceleration:

$$
\theta = \omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2} (-\alpha) t^2
$$

Substitute $\theta = 4\pi$:

$$
4\pi = \omega_0 t - \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2
$$

Rearrange this equation into standard quadratic form:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2 - \omega_0 t + 4\pi = 0
$$

Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

$$
\alpha t^2 - 2 \omega_0 t + 8\pi = 0
$$

Solve for $t$ using the quadratic formula $t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = \alpha$, $b = -2\omega_0$, and $c = 8\pi$:

$$
t = \frac{2\omega_0 \pm \sqrt{(-2\omega_0)^2 - 4(\alpha)(8\pi)}}{2\alpha} = \frac{2\omega_0 \pm \sqrt{4\omega_0^2 - 32\pi\alpha}}{2\alpha}
$$

Simplify the expression under the square root:

$$
t = \frac{2\omega_0 \pm \sqrt{4(\omega_0^2 - 8\pi\alpha)}}{2\alpha} = \frac{2\omega_0 \pm 2\sqrt{\omega_0^2 - 8\pi\alpha}}{2\alpha} = \frac{\omega_0 \pm \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - 8\pi\alpha}}{\alpha}
$$

The two solutions are:

$$
t_1 = \frac{\omega_0 + \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - 8\pi\alpha}}{\alpha}, \quad t_2 = \frac{\omega_0 - \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - 8\pi\alpha}}{\alpha}
$$

Since the top is decelerating and will stop after a finite time, we need the time when it completes the displacement $4\pi$ before stopping. The larger root $t_1$ exceeds the stopping time $\frac{\omega_0}{\alpha}$, which is unphysical. The smaller root $t_2$ is positive and less than $\frac{\omega_0}{\alpha}$, corresponding to the time taken during deceleration. Thus, the physically meaningful solution is:

$$
t = \frac{\omega_0 - \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - 8\pi\alpha}}{\alpha}
$$

This expression gives the time to complete two revolutions before stopping.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\omega_0 - \sqrt{\omega_0^{2} - 8\pi\alpha}}{\alpha}}$$

### Problem 27
##### Background
In mechanical engineering, the analysis of rotating systems is critical for designing components like flywheels in energy storage systems or turbochargers in automotive engines. A flywheel starting from rest and undergoing constant angular acceleration is a fundamental scenario for understanding how rotational kinetic energy builds up during angular displacement. This problem explores the kinematic relationship between angular acceleration, displacement, and final velocity without involving time as an explicit variable.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

- Derivation of angular velocity from angular displacement and acceleration  
- Interpretation of squared angular velocity as proportional to rotational kinetic energy  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to torque ($\tau = I\alpha$) and moment of inertia ($I$) in rotational dynamics  
- Relates to work-energy theorem ($W = \Delta K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$)  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Physics**: Conservation of energy principles in rotational systems  
- **Automotive Engineering**: Calculating wheel speeds during vehicle acceleration  
- **Robotics**: Precision control of robotic arm joints  

##### Real-World Applications
- **Regenerative Braking Systems**: Flywheels store kinetic energy during angular acceleration. Knowing $\omega$ after a given $\theta$ helps engineers design optimal energy recovery.  
- **Centrifuges**: Medical labs use this to determine final rotational speed after a specific rotation angle for blood sample separation.  
- **Wind Turbines**: Blade rotation dynamics during startup sequences under constant torque.  

##### Problem Statement
A flywheel for an energy storage system starts from rest ($\omega_0 = 0$) and undergoes constant angular acceleration $\alpha$. Derive an expression for its angular velocity $\omega$ after it has rotated through an angular displacement $\theta$. Use only the symbols $\alpha$ and $\theta$ in your final expression.

### Solution
We start with the kinematic equations for rotational motion under constant angular acceleration. The two relevant equations are:  
1. Angular velocity as a function of time: $\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t$  
2. Angular displacement as a function of time: $\theta = \omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2$  

Given $\omega_0 = 0$, these simplify to:  
$$\omega = \alpha t \quad (1)$$  
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2 \quad (2)$$  

We need to eliminate $t$ to relate $\omega$ directly to $\theta$ and $\alpha$. Solve equation (1) for $t$:  
$$t = \frac{\omega}{\alpha} \quad (3)$$  

Substitute equation (3) into equation (2):  
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2} \alpha \left( \frac{\omega}{\alpha} \right)^2$$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2} \alpha \cdot \frac{\omega^2}{\alpha^2} = \frac{\omega^2}{2\alpha}$$  

Solve for $\omega^2$:  
$$\omega^2 = 2\alpha\theta$$  

Take the square root of both sides. Since angular speed is non-negative for accelerating systems:  
$$\omega = \sqrt{2\alpha\theta}$$  

**Alternative derivation via work-energy theorem**:  
The work done by net torque $\tau$ over displacement $\theta$ equals the change in rotational kinetic energy:  
$$\tau \theta = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 - \frac{1}{2} I \omega_0^2$$  
With $\omega_0 = 0$ and $\tau = I\alpha$:  
$$(I\alpha) \theta = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2$$  
Cancel $I$ (assuming $I \neq 0$):  
$$\alpha \theta = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2$$  
$$\omega^2 = 2\alpha\theta \implies \omega = \sqrt{2\alpha\theta}$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{2\alpha\theta}}$$

------
### Problem 28
##### Background
Bicycles use a chain drive system to transfer rotational motion from the pedals (front sprocket) to the rear wheel (rear sprocket). The chain engages with both sprockets without slipping, enforcing a direct relationship between their angular velocities based on their radii. This principle is fundamental to gear ratio calculations in rotational kinematics.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Conversion between angular velocity units (rpm to rad/s).
- Relationship between linear velocity and angular velocity: $ v = r \omega $.
- Conservation of linear velocity across connected rotating components (chain constraint).

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
Connects to concepts of rotational kinematics (angular displacement, velocity, acceleration) and rigid-body dynamics. Extends to gear train analysis and mechanical advantage in torque transmission.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Mechanical engineering (design of transmission systems), sports science (bicycle efficiency), and physics (conservation principles in rotational systems).

##### Real-World Applications
Bicycle gear systems optimize pedaling efficiency across terrains. Similar chain-and-sprocket mechanisms appear in motorcycles, conveyor belts, and industrial machinery for power transmission.

##### Problem Statement
The front sprocket of a bicycle has radius $ R_f $ and rotates at $ N $ revolutions per minute (rpm). It is connected via a taut, non-slipping chain to a rear sprocket of radius $ R_r $. Derive an expression for the angular velocity of the rear sprocket in radians per second (rad/s). Express your answer symbolically in terms of $ R_f $, $ R_r $, $ N $, and fundamental constants as needed.

### Solution
**Step 1: Convert front sprocket angular velocity to rad/s**  
Given angular velocity of front sprocket: $ N $ rpm.  
- 1 revolution = $ 2\pi $ radians.  
- 1 minute = 60 seconds.  
Thus:  
$$ \omega_f = N \frac{\text{rev}}{\text{min}} \times \frac{2\pi \text{ rad}}{1 \text{ rev}} \times \frac{1 \text{ min}}{60 \text{ s}} = \frac{2\pi N}{60} = \frac{\pi N}{30} \text{ rad/s} $$

**Step 2: Apply chain constraint (equal linear velocities)**  
The linear velocity $ v $ at the edge of both sprockets must be identical because the chain does not slip:  
$$ v_f = v_r $$  
Substitute $ v = r \omega $:  
$$ R_f \omega_f = R_r \omega_r $$  
where $ \omega_r $ is the rear angular velocity in rad/s.

**Step 3: Solve for rear angular velocity**  
Rearrange the equation:  
$$ \omega_r = \frac{R_f \omega_f}{R_r} $$  
Substitute $ \omega_f = \frac{\pi N}{30} $:  
$$ \omega_r = \frac{R_f}{R_r} \left( \frac{\pi N}{30} \right) = \frac{\pi N R_f}{30 R_r} $$  
The expression for the rear angular velocity in rad/s is $ \frac{\pi N R_f}{30 R_r} $.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\pi N R_f}{30 R_r}}$$

------
### Problem 29
##### Background
A car tire rolls without slipping on a flat road. The tire has a radius $R$. The car accelerates linearly, causing its linear speed to change from $v_i$ to $v_f$ over a time interval $t$. Since the tire rolls without slipping, its linear motion is directly related to its rotational motion.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Relationship between linear velocity and angular velocity: $v = R\omega$
- Definition of angular acceleration: $\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}$
- Kinematic equations for constant angular acceleration

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects linear kinematics (acceleration, velocity) to rotational kinematics (angular acceleration, angular velocity) through the condition of rolling without slipping.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The principles apply to automotive engineering (tire dynamics), robotics (wheel control systems), and physics (conservation of energy in rotational systems).

##### Real-World Applications
Calculating angular acceleration is essential for designing anti-lock braking systems (ABS), optimizing tire traction, and analyzing vehicle stability during acceleration or deceleration.

##### Problem Statement
A car tire of radius $R$ rolls without slipping. The car's linear speed changes from $v_i$ to $v_f$ over a time interval $t$. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the tire. Express $\alpha$ symbolically in terms of $R$, $v_i$, $v_f$, and $t$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Relate linear and angular velocities**  
Since the tire rolls without slipping, the linear velocity $v$ at the edge of the tire equals the product of the radius $R$ and the angular velocity $\omega$:  
$$ v = R\omega $$

**Step 2: Express initial and final angular velocities**  
The initial angular velocity $\omega_i$ corresponds to the initial linear velocity $v_i$:  
$$ \omega_i = \frac{v_i}{R} $$  
The final angular velocity $\omega_f$ corresponds to the final linear velocity $v_f$:  
$$ \omega_f = \frac{v_f}{R} $$  

**Step 3: Apply the angular acceleration formula**  
Angular acceleration $\alpha$ is defined as the rate of change of angular velocity. For constant angular acceleration:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \frac{\omega_f - \omega_i}{t} $$  

**Step 4: Substitute expressions**  
Substitute $\omega_f$ and $\omega_i$ from Step 2 into the equation:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{\frac{v_f}{R} - \frac{v_i}{R}}{t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{R t} $$  

**Step 5: Simplify the expression**  
The derived expression for angular acceleration is:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{v_f - v_i}{R t} $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{v_f - v_i}{R t}}$$

### Problem 3
##### Background
A cyclist is testing a new bicycle on a straight track. The cyclist starts from rest and accelerates uniformly with a linear acceleration of magnitude $a$. The bicycle wheels have a radius of $R$ and roll without slipping. Rolling without slipping means the distance traveled by the center of the wheel equals the arc length rotated by the wheel.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Relationship between linear and angular kinematics for rolling without slipping.
- Uniformly accelerated motion in linear and rotational contexts.
- Vector addition of velocities (relative velocity concept).

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- This problem connects the linear motion of the bicycle (translational kinematics) and the rotational motion of the wheels (rotational kinematics), reinforcing how angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration arise from linear analogs.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: The design of wheeled vehicles requires understanding the relationship between linear and rotational motion to optimize performance and safety.
- **Sports Science**: Analyzing the performance of cyclists and their equipment involves calculating forces and velocities at different points on moving components.

##### Real-World Applications
- Calculating the speed of a point on a rotating wheel is essential for designing tires that can withstand stresses during acceleration. This applies to automotive engineering (e.g., calculating centrifugal forces on car wheels) and sports equipment design (e.g., stress analysis in bicycle rims).

##### Problem Statement
At a time $t$ after starting from rest, what is the linear speed (i.e., the tangential speed) of a point on the rim of the wheel relative to the center of the wheel? Express your answer symbolically in terms of the given quantities $a$ and $t$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify key relationships**  
The bicycle wheels roll without slipping, so the linear acceleration $a$ of the bicycle (which is the acceleration of the wheel's center) relates to the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the wheel by:  
$$ a = R \alpha $$  
Solving for $\alpha$:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{a}{R} $$

**Step 2: Determine angular velocity**  
Since the bicycle starts from rest, the initial angular velocity $\omega_0 = 0$. With constant angular acceleration $\alpha$, the angular velocity $\omega$ at time $t$ is:  
$$ \omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t = 0 + \left( \frac{a}{R} \right) t = \frac{a}{R} t $$

**Step 3: Relate angular velocity to tangential speed**  
The tangential speed $v_{\text{tang}}$ of a point on the rim relative to the center is given by:  
$$ v_{\text{tang}} = R \omega $$  
Substitute $\omega$ from Step 2:  
$$ v_{\text{tang}} = R \cdot \left( \frac{a}{R} t \right) = a t $$  

**Conclusion**  
The linear speed (tangential speed) of a point on the rim relative to the center at time $t$ is $a t$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{at}$$

### Problem 30
##### Background
In automotive engineering, the dynamics of wheel motion are critical for vehicle performance. When a car accelerates, its wheels roll without slipping on the road surface. This condition ensures that the linear motion of the car and the rotational motion of the wheels are directly linked. Engineers must understand this relationship to design efficient braking and acceleration systems.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- The kinematic condition for rolling without slipping.
- Relationship between linear acceleration and angular acceleration.
- Differentiation of velocity equations to derive acceleration relationships.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to rotational kinematics, rigid body dynamics, and the application of derivatives in motion analysis. It extends to torque and moment of inertia in rotational dynamics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Mechanical engineering (vehicle dynamics), robotics (wheeled mobile robots), and physics education technology (sensor-based motion tracking). The principles are used in anti-lock braking systems (ABS) to prevent skidding.

##### Real-World Applications
Calculating angular acceleration is essential for:
1. Determining the required engine torque for a target vehicle acceleration.
2. Designing traction control systems that maintain wheel-road adhesion.
3. Analyzing wear patterns in tires under different acceleration profiles.

##### Problem Statement
A car accelerates in a straight line with its wheels rolling without slipping on a horizontal road. The linear acceleration of the car (equivalent to the linear acceleration of the center of any wheel) is denoted as $a$. The wheels each have radius $R$.  
Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the wheels. Begin with the fundamental no-slip condition and show all steps. Express $\alpha$ solely in terms of $a$ and $R$.

### Solution
The condition for rolling without slipping states that the linear velocity $v$ of the center of the wheel equals the product of the wheel's radius $R$ and its angular velocity $\omega$:  
$$ v = R \omega $$  

To relate accelerations, differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to time $t$. Apply the chain rule:  
$$ \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (R \omega) $$  

The left side is the linear acceleration $a$:  
$$ a = \frac{dv}{dt} $$  

The right side, since $R$ is constant, simplifies to:  
$$ R \frac{d\omega}{dt} $$  

The derivative $\frac{d\omega}{dt}$ is the angular acceleration $\alpha$:  
$$ R \frac{d\omega}{dt} = R \alpha $$  

Equating both sides:  
$$ a = R \alpha $$  

Solving for $\alpha$:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{a}{R} $$  

This derivation holds for any wheel rolling without slipping, regardless of the specific values of $a$ and $R$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{a}{R}}$$

### Problem 31
##### Background
A ceiling fan, commonly found in households, rotates with blades that sweep out a circular path. When the fan is turned off, it experiences a uniform angular deceleration due to friction and air resistance. Understanding the deceleration profile is essential for designing efficient motors and braking systems in rotating machinery.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Conversion of angular velocity between revolutions per minute (rpm) and radians per second (rad/s).
- Application of kinematic equations for rotational motion under constant angular acceleration: $\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta$.
- Calculation of angular acceleration magnitude from initial and final angular velocities and angular displacement.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to linear kinematics (where $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2as$) and torque dynamics (since angular acceleration relates to net torque via $\tau = I\alpha$). It also reinforces the concept of rotational inertia in mechanical systems.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Rotational motion principles apply to automotive engineering (wheel deceleration during braking), aerospace (control surfaces), and biomechanics (joint movements). The unit conversion aspect bridges physics and applied mathematics.

##### Real-World Applications
Calculating deceleration is vital for optimizing the shutdown time of industrial fans, turbines, and hard drives. It also informs safety features in amusement park rides where controlled rotational stopping is critical.

##### Problem Statement
A ceiling fan decelerates uniformly from 90 revolutions per minute (rpm) to 30 rpm while rotating through an angular displacement of 24 radians. Calculate the magnitude of the angular deceleration in rad/s². Express your answer as an exact analytic expression. Provide only the numerical coefficient without units, using $\pi$ where needed.  
**Note**: Angular deceleration is defined as the magnitude of the negative angular acceleration.

### Solution
**Step 1: Convert angular velocities to rad/s**  
Given:  
- Initial angular velocity, $\omega_i = 90  \text{rpm}$  
- Final angular velocity, $\omega_f = 30  \text{rpm}$  

Convert rpm to rad/s using the relationship:  

$$
1  \text{rpm} = \frac{2\pi}{60}  \text{rad/s}
$$
  
Thus,  

$$
\omega_i = 90 \times \frac{2\pi}{60} = 90 \times \frac{\pi}{30} = 3\pi  \text{rad/s},
$$
  

$$
\omega_f = 30 \times \frac{2\pi}{60} = 30 \times \frac{\pi}{30} = \pi  \text{rad/s}.
$$


**Step 2: Apply rotational kinematic equation**  
The kinematic equation for constant angular acceleration is:  

$$
\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta,
$$
  
where $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration and $\theta = 24  \text{rad}$ is the angular displacement. Solving for $\alpha$:  

$$
\alpha = \frac{\omega_f^2 - \omega_i^2}{2\theta}.
$$


**Step 3: Substitute values**  

$$
\alpha = \frac{(\pi)^2 - (3\pi)^2}{2 \times 24} = \frac{\pi^2 - 9\pi^2}{48} = \frac{-8\pi^2}{48} = -\frac{\pi^2}{6}  \text{rad/s}^2.
$$


**Step 4: Compute angular deceleration magnitude**  
Angular deceleration is the absolute value of $\alpha$:  

$$
|\alpha| = \left|-\frac{\pi^2}{6}\right| = \frac{\pi^2}{6}  \text{rad/s}^2.

### Problem 32
##### Background
Circular motion is a fundamental concept in kinematics, where an object moves along a circular path. When the motion is uniform (constant angular velocity), the object experiences a centripetal acceleration directed toward the center of the circle. This acceleration arises from the continuous change in the direction of the velocity vector, even if the speed is constant. Centripetal acceleration is crucial in systems ranging from planetary orbits to mechanical rotating devices.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Definition of centripetal acceleration in uniform circular motion.
- Relationship between angular speed, radius, and centripetal acceleration.
- Algebraic manipulation to derive an expression for angular speed.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to rotational kinematics (angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration), dynamics (forces causing centripetal acceleration), and energy considerations in rotational systems. It also reinforces vector decomposition, as centripetal acceleration is perpendicular to tangential velocity.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Astronomy:** Calculation of orbital speeds for satellites or planets under gravitational centripetal force.
- **Sports Science:** Analysis of athlete motion in circular tracks or during rotational maneuvers (e.g., discus throw).

##### Real-World Applications

- **Particle Physics:** Controlling the angular velocity of particles in cyclotrons to maintain trajectory under magnetic fields.
- **Amusement Park Rides:** Designing roller coaster loops with radii and speeds that ensure rider safety via adequate centripetal acceleration.

##### Problem Statement
A particle moves uniformly along a circular path of radius $R$. The magnitude of its centripetal acceleration is $a_c$. Derive an expression for the angular speed $\omega$ of the particle.  
Express your answer symbolically in terms of $a_c$ and $R$.

### Solution
The centripetal acceleration $a_c$ for an object in uniform circular motion is given by:  
$$ a_c = \omega^2 R $$  
where $\omega$ is the angular speed and $R$ is the radius of the circular path.  

To solve for $\omega$, rearrange the equation:  
$$ \omega^2 = \frac{a_c}{R} $$  

Take the square root of both sides. Since angular speed is non-negative, we consider the positive root:  
$$ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{a_c}{R}} $$  

Thus, the angular speed $\omega$ is $\sqrt{\frac{a_c}{R}}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{a_c}{R}}}$$

------
### Problem 33
##### Background
A Ferris wheel at an amusement park has a radius $R$. During its startup phase, the wheel begins at rest and accelerates uniformly (constant angular acceleration). An engineer observes that the first full revolution (a complete 360° turn) occurs in a specific time interval after motion begins. This scenario models real-world systems where controlled acceleration is critical, such as in ride safety design or industrial rotating machinery.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Definition of angular displacement and its relationship to revolutions.
- Kinematic equations for rotational motion under constant angular acceleration.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering:** Startup torque control in electric motors driving Ferris wheels.

- **Wind Turbines:** Controlled angular acceleration during startup minimizes mechanical stress on blades and gearboxes.
- **Robotics:** Precise control of joint rotation in robotic arms for manufacturing or surgery.

##### Problem Statement
A Ferris wheel of radius $R$ starts from rest ($\omega_0 = 0$) and experiences constant angular acceleration $\alpha$. The time taken to complete the first full revolution (angular displacement $\theta = 2\pi$ radians) is $T$. Derive an expression for the angular velocity $\omega$ (in rad/s) at the exact moment the wheel completes this first revolution. Express your answer solely in terms of $T$ and fundamental constants. Do not include $R$ or $\alpha$ in your final expression.  

**Answer Format Instructions:**  
- Provide an analytic expression.  
- Use $\pi$ for the circle constant.  
- Omit units in your boxed answer.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify known quantities**  
- Initial angular velocity: $\omega_0 = 0$  
- Angular displacement for one revolution: $\theta = 2\pi$ radians  
- Time elapsed: $t = T$  
- Motion characteristic: Constant angular acceleration $\alpha$  

**Step 2: Apply rotational kinematic equation for displacement**  
The equation relating angular displacement, initial velocity, acceleration, and time is:  
$$\theta = \omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2$$  
Substitute known values:  
$$2\pi = (0)(T) + \frac{1}{2} \alpha T^2$$  
Simplify to solve for $\alpha$:  
$$2\pi = \frac{1}{2} \alpha T^2$$  
$$\alpha = \frac{4\pi}{T^2}$$  

**Step 3: Apply rotational kinematic equation for final velocity**  
The equation relating final angular velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and time is:  
$$\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t$$  
Substitute $\omega_0 = 0$, $t = T$, and $\alpha = \frac{4\pi}{T^2}$:  
$$\omega = 0 + \left( \frac{4\pi}{T^2} \right) T$$  
Simplify:  
$$\omega = \frac{4\pi}{T}$$  

**Verification using displacement-velocity relationship**  
The kinematic equation independent of time is:  
$$\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2 \alpha \theta$$  
Substitute known values:  
$$\omega^2 = (0)^2 + 2 \left( \frac{4\pi}{T^2} \right) (2\pi)$$  
$$\omega^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{4\pi}{T^2} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{16\pi^2}{T^2}$$  
Take the positive root (since motion direction is consistent with acceleration):  
$$\omega = \frac{4\pi}{T}$$  
Both methods yield identical results.  

**Conclusion**  
The angular velocity at the completion of the first revolution is $\frac{4\pi}{T}$ rad/s. Note that $R$ does not appear in the expression, as angular velocity depends only on temporal and geometric constraints of rotation, not radial size.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{4\pi}{T}}$$

------

##### Problem Statement
A cylindrical space station initially rotates at 4 rad/s. It undergoes uniform angular acceleration until reaching 12 rad/s, during which it completes an angular displacement of 8π radians. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration α. Express your final answer as an exact simplified expression without units.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify known quantities**  
- Initial angular velocity: $\omega_i = 4  \text{rad/s}$  
- Final angular velocity: $\omega_f = 12  \text{rad/s}$  
- Angular displacement: $\theta = 8\pi  \text{rad}$  
- Angular acceleration: $\alpha$ (constant, unknown)  

**Step 2: Select appropriate kinematic equation**  
The relationship connecting $\omega_i$, $\omega_f$, $\theta$, and $\alpha$ without time is:  
$$ \omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta $$  

**Step 3: Solve for angular acceleration**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $\alpha$:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{\omega_f^2 - \omega_i^2}{2\theta} $$  

**Step 4: Substitute given values**  
$$ \alpha = \frac{(12)^2 - (4)^2}{2 \cdot (8\pi)} = \frac{144 - 16}{16\pi} = \frac{128}{16\pi} $$  

**Step 5: Simplify the expression**  
$$ \alpha = \frac{128}{16\pi} = \frac{8}{\pi} $$  
The result is exact and simplified.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{8}{\pi}}$$

##### Problem Statement
A laboratory centrifuge rotor starts from rest and accelerates uniformly. When it has rotated through an angular displacement of $\theta$ radians, it reaches an angular velocity of $\omega$ radians per second. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha$ during this interval. Express $\alpha$ solely in terms of $\omega$ and $\theta$.

### Solution
We begin with the fundamental kinematic relationships for rotational motion. Angular acceleration $\alpha$ is defined as the derivative of angular velocity $\omega$ with respect to time $t$:
$$
\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}.
$$
Angular velocity $\omega$ is the derivative of angular displacement $\theta$ with respect to time:
$$
\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}.
$$
Using the chain rule, we relate $\alpha$ to $\theta$:
$$
\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt} = \frac{d\omega}{d\theta} \cdot \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{d\omega}{d\theta} \cdot \omega.
$$
Rearranging terms gives:
$$
\alpha  d\theta = \omega  d\omega.
$$
Since the acceleration is uniform, $\alpha$ is constant. Integrate both sides with initial conditions: at $t = 0$, $\theta_0 = 0$ and $\omega_0 = 0$. After rotation through $\theta$, the angular velocity is $\omega$:
$$
\int_{0}^{\theta} \alpha  d\theta = \int_{0}^{\omega} \omega  d\omega.
$$
Solving the integrals:
$$
\alpha \int_{0}^{\theta} d\theta = \int_{0}^{\omega} \omega  d\omega \implies \alpha \theta = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 \Big|_{0}^{\omega} \implies \alpha \theta = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2.
$$
Isolate $\alpha$:
$$
\alpha = \frac{\omega^2}{2\theta}.
$$
This expression relates angular acceleration to angular velocity and displacement without requiring time explicitly.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\omega^{2}}{2\theta}}$$

### Problem 36
##### Background
In automotive engineering, the motion of a rotating car tire can be analyzed using rotational kinematics. When a car accelerates, each point on the tire's outer edge experiences both tangential and radial (centripetal) acceleration components. The tangential acceleration results from changes in the tire's angular speed, while the centripetal acceleration arises from its rotational motion. This problem explores the relationship between linear (tangential) acceleration at the tire's edge and its angular acceleration.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Definition of tangential acceleration ($a_t$) and angular acceleration ($\alpha$).
- Fundamental kinematic relationship between linear and rotational motion.
- Application of differentiation to derive connections between linear and angular quantities.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to rotational dynamics, where torque and moment of inertia govern angular acceleration.
- Extends concepts of linear kinematics (velocity, acceleration) to rotational analogs (angular velocity, angular acceleration).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications
- Automotive safety systems: Sensors measure tangential acceleration to detect wheel slip or skidding, enabling real-time adjustments in traction control systems.
- Performance testing: Engineers use angular acceleration metrics to optimize tire grip and vehicle acceleration profiles.

##### Problem Statement
A car tire of radius $R$ rotates about its central axis. At a specific instant, a point on the outer edge of the tire experiences a tangential acceleration $a_t$. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the tire in terms of $R$ and $a_t$. Begin from the definition of angular acceleration and the relationship between linear tangential velocity and angular velocity.  
**Express $\alpha$ symbolically using only $a_t$ and $R$.**

### Solution
To derive the angular acceleration $\alpha$, start with the relationship between linear tangential velocity $v_t$ and angular velocity $\omega$ for a point on the outer edge of the tire. The distance from the axis of rotation is the radius $R$, so:  
$$ v_t = R \omega $$  

Differentiate both sides with respect to time $t$ to relate acceleration terms. The derivative of $v_t$ is the tangential acceleration $a_t$, and the derivative of $\omega$ is the angular acceleration $\alpha$:  
$$ \frac{d}{dt}(v_t) = \frac{d}{dt}(R \omega) $$  

Since $R$ is constant:  
$$ a_t = R \frac{d\omega}{dt} $$  

By definition, $\frac{d\omega}{dt} = \alpha$. Substituting this yields:  
$$ a_t = R \alpha $$  

Solving for $\alpha$:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{a_t}{R} $$  

This confirms that angular acceleration is directly proportional to tangential acceleration and inversely proportional to the radius.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{a_t}{R}}$$

------
### Problem 37
##### Background
Flywheels are mechanical energy storage devices used in applications like power grids, automotive systems, and industrial machinery.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Kinematic equations for rotational motion with constant angular acceleration.  
3. Algebraic manipulation of angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration relationships.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Physics**: Conservation of energy during rotational acceleration.  
- **Mathematics**: Solving quadratic equations and handling transcendental constants ($\pi$).  

##### Real-World Applications
Flywheels buffer energy in electric vehicles (regenerative braking), stabilize power in data centers, and enable pulsed power in fusion reactors. Precise acceleration control prevents material stress failures.

##### Problem Statement
A flywheel starts from rest and accelerates uniformly until it reaches an angular velocity of $8\pi$ radians per second. During this acceleration, it completes exactly 40 revolutions. Determine the angular acceleration of the flywheel. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $\pi$, simplified to the lowest terms. Do not include units in your final expression.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Convert angular displacement to radians  
The flywheel completes 40 revolutions. Since 1 revolution = $2\pi$ radians, the total angular displacement $\theta$ is:  
$$\theta = 40 \times 2\pi = 80\pi \ \text{radians}.$$  

##### Step 2: Identify known quantities  
- Initial angular velocity $\omega_0 = 0 \ \text{rad/s}$ (starts from rest).  
- Final angular velocity $\omega = 8\pi \ \text{rad/s}$.  
- Angular displacement $\theta = 80\pi \ \text{rad}$.  

##### Step 3: Apply the rotational kinematics equation  
For constant angular acceleration $\alpha$, the relationship is:  
$$\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha\theta.$$  
Substitute $\omega_0 = 0$:  
$$(8\pi)^2 = 0 + 2\alpha(80\pi).$$  

##### Step 4: Solve for $\alpha$  
Simplify the equation:  
$$64\pi^2 = 160\pi \alpha.$$  
Divide both sides by $\pi$ (since $\pi \neq 0$):  
$$64\pi = 160\alpha.$$  
Solve for $\alpha$:  
$$\alpha = \frac{64\pi}{160}.$$  

##### Step 5: Simplify the expression  
Reduce the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 32:  
$$\alpha = \frac{64 \div 32}{160 \div 32} \pi = \frac{2}{5}\pi.$$  
The angular acceleration is $\frac{2\pi}{5}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{2\pi}{5}}$$

### Problem 38
##### Background

2. Differentiation of polynomial functions.  
3. Interpretation of kinematic quantities in rotational motion.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications

- Analyzing centrifuge acceleration profiles in medical laboratories.  
- Simulating roller coaster rotations during launch sequences.  

##### Problem Statement
A merry-go-round's angular displacement is given by $\theta(t) = A t^3$, where $A$ is a constant (in rad/s³), and $t$ is time in seconds. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha(t)$ at any time $t$. Then, express the angular acceleration at time $t = T$ in terms of $A$ and $T$.  
Provide your final answer as an analytic expression using the variables $A$ and $T$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Define angular velocity**  
Angular velocity $\omega(t)$ is the first derivative of angular displacement $\theta(t)$ with respect to time:  
$$\omega(t) = \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(A t^3\right).$$  

**Step 2: Differentiate $\theta(t)$**  
Apply the power rule for differentiation:  
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(A t^3\right) = A \cdot 3t^{2} = 3A t^2.$$  
Thus, $\omega(t) = 3A t^2$.  

**Step 3: Define angular acceleration**  
Angular acceleration $\alpha(t)$ is the first derivative of angular velocity $\omega(t)$:  
$$\alpha(t) = \frac{d\omega}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(3A t^2\right).$$  

**Step 4: Differentiate $\omega(t)$**  
Apply the power rule again:  
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(3A t^2\right) = 3A \cdot 2t = 6A t.$$  
Thus, $\alpha(t) = 6A t$.  

**Step 5: Evaluate at $t = T$**  
Substitute $t = T$ into the expression for $\alpha(t)$:  
$$\alpha(T) = 6A \cdot T.$$  
This gives the angular acceleration at time $T$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{6AT}$$

### Problem 39
##### Background
Artificial satellites in circular orbits around Earth are crucial for communication, weather monitoring, and navigation. These satellites move with constant angular velocity due to the balance between gravitational force and centripetal force. Understanding the kinematics of such motion requires deriving relationships between angular quantities and linear acceleration.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Definition of centripetal acceleration in circular motion.
2. Relationship between angular velocity and linear velocity.
3. Algebraic derivation of acceleration magnitude from fundamental parameters.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to rotational dynamics, including torque, angular momentum, and moment of inertia, which extend the principles of circular motion to rigid bodies.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Satellite motion involves principles from aerospace engineering (orbital mechanics) and geophysics (gravitational field interactions). The derived acceleration is essential for calculating gravitational forces in celestial mechanics.

##### Real-World Applications
Centripetal acceleration calculations are vital for:
- Determining orbital parameters of satellites (e.g., GPS satellites).
- Designing centrifugal systems in engineering (e.g., centrifuges, amusement park rides).
- Analyzing particle motion in accelerators for high-energy physics experiments.

##### Problem Statement
A satellite orbits Earth in a circular path with angular velocity $\omega$ and orbital radius $r$. Derive an expression for the magnitude of its centripetal acceleration $a_c$ exclusively in terms of $\omega$ and $r$. Ensure your derivation starts from the definition of centripetal acceleration and explicitly relates linear and angular quantities.

### Solution
**Step 1: State the definition of centripetal acceleration**  
Centripetal acceleration for an object in uniform circular motion is given by:  
$$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $$  
where $v$ is the linear speed and $r$ is the radius of the circular path.  

**Step 2: Relate linear velocity to angular velocity**  
The linear speed $v$ is related to angular velocity $\omega$ and radius $r$ by:  
$$ v = \omega r $$  
This arises because angular displacement $\theta$ (in radians) satisfies $\theta = s / r$, where $s$ is arc length. Differentiating with respect to time gives $\omega = v / r$, thus $v = \omega r$.  

**Step 3: Substitute into the centripetal acceleration formula**  
Replace $v$ in the centripetal acceleration expression:  
$$ a_c = \frac{(\omega r)^2}{r} $$  

**Step 4: Simplify algebraically**  
Expand and reduce the expression:  
$$ a_c = \frac{\omega^2 r^2}{r} = \omega^2 r $$  
The radius $r$ cancels one power in the denominator, yielding the final expression.  

**Conclusion**  
The magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is $\omega^2 r$, derived solely from kinematic relationships in circular motion.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\omega^{2} r}$$

A centrifuge rotor accelerates uniformly from an initial angular velocity $\omega_i = 100  \text{rad/s}$ to a final angular velocity $\omega_f = 250  \text{rad/s}$ in $t = 5  \text{s}$. Derive the expression for angular acceleration $\alpha$ starting from the definition of constant angular acceleration. Then, compute its numerical value.  
**Express your final answer as a numerical value in $\text{rad/s}^2$ without units.**

### Solution
The angular acceleration $\alpha$ is defined as the rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time. For constant angular acceleration, this is:  
$$\alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}$$  
where $\Delta \omega$ is the change in angular velocity and $\Delta t$ is the time interval.  

Given:  
- Initial angular velocity $\omega_i = 100  \text{rad/s}$  
- Final angular velocity $\omega_f = 250  \text{rad/s}$  
- Time interval $\Delta t = t - 0 = 5  \text{s}$ (assuming $t_0 = 0$)  

The change in angular velocity is:  
$$\Delta \omega = \omega_f - \omega_i = 250 - 100 = 150  \text{rad/s}$$  

Substitute into the definition of angular acceleration:  
$$\alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \frac{150}{5}$$  

Simplify the expression:  
$$\alpha = 30$$  

Thus, the angular acceleration is $30  \text{rad/s}^2$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Convert revolutions to radians**  
The angular displacement $\theta$ in radians is:  

$$
\theta = 2\pi N
$$
  
This conversion ensures compatibility with rotational kinematics equations (which use radians).

**Step 2: Apply the rotational kinematics equation**  
For constant angular acceleration, the relationship between initial angular velocity ($\omega_0$), final angular velocity ($\omega$), angular acceleration ($\alpha$), and angular displacement ($\theta$) is:  

$$
\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha\theta
$$
  
Since the flywheel is decelerating, $\alpha$ is negative. Thus, we use $-\alpha$ for acceleration in the equation:  

$$
\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2(-\alpha)\theta
$$


**Step 3: Substitute $\theta$ and solve for $\omega_0$**  
Substitute $\theta = 2\pi N$:  

$$
\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 - 2\alpha(2\pi N)
$$
  

$$
\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 - 4\pi\alpha N
$$
  
Solve for $\omega_0^2$:  

$$
\omega_0^2 = \omega^2 + 4\pi\alpha N
$$
  
Take the positive square root (as angular velocity magnitude is non-negative):  

$$
\omega_0 = \sqrt{\omega^2 + 4\pi\alpha N}
$$
  
This is the expression for the initial angular velocity.

### Answer
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{\omega^{2} + 4\pi\alpha N}}
\]

### Problem 6
##### Background
In mechanical engineering, gear systems are fundamental for transmitting motion and torque between rotating shafts. When two gears mesh, their teeth interlock, ensuring that the linear velocities at the point of contact are equal. This principle allows engineers to control rotational speeds in devices like transmissions, clocks, and industrial machinery. 

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Relationship between angular velocity ($\omega$) and linear velocity ($v$): $v = r \omega$.
2. Kinematic condition for meshed gears: equality of linear velocities at the contact point.
3. Algebraic manipulation to derive angular velocities.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem bridges rotational kinematics and dynamics, emphasizing how gear geometry influences motion transmission. It also reinforces the concept of mechanical advantage in rotational systems.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Physics**: Conservation of energy (work done by gears) and torque transmission.
- **Mathematics**: Proportional reasoning and inverse relationships (radius vs. angular velocity).
- **Engineering**: Design of gear trains in automotive and robotics applications.

##### Real-World Applications
- **Automotive Transmissions**: Adjusting wheel speed relative to engine RPM.
- **Wind Turbines**: Converting low-speed rotor motion to high-speed generator rotation.
- **Robotics**: Precision control of joint movements via gear reducers.

##### Problem Statement
Two gears, $\text{Gear A}$ (radius $r_A$) and $\text{Gear B}$ (radius $r_B$), are meshed directly. $\text{Gear A}$ rotates with a constant angular velocity $\omega_A$. Derive an expression for the angular velocity $\omega_B$ of $\text{Gear B}$ in terms of $r_A$, $r_B$, and $\omega_A$. Ensure your derivation starts from fundamental principles.

### Solution
##### Step-by-Step Derivation:

1. **Fundamental Principle (Linear Velocity Equality)**  
   At the point of contact between meshed gears, the linear velocities must be equal to prevent slipping. For $\text{Gear A}$ and $\text{Gear B}$:  
   $$ v_A = v_B $$

2. **Express Linear Velocities**  
   The linear velocity $v$ at the gear's edge relates to its angular velocity $\omega$ and radius $r$:  
   $$ v_A = r_A \omega_A $$  
   $$ v_B = r_B \omega_B $$

3. **Apply the Equality Condition**  
   Substitute the expressions for $v_A$ and $v_B$ into the velocity-equality equation:  
   $$ r_A \omega_A = r_B \omega_B $$

4. **Solve for $\omega_B$**  
   Rearrange the equation to isolate $\omega_B$:  
   $$ \omega_B = \left( \frac{r_A}{r_B} \right) \omega_A $$

##### Conclusion
The angular velocity of $\text{Gear B}$ is inversely proportional to its radius relative to $\text{Gear A}$. The derived expression is:  
$$ \omega_B = \frac{r_A}{r_B} \omega_A $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{ r_A \omega_A }{ r_B }}$$

### Problem 7
##### Background
Centripetal acceleration is a fundamental concept in rotational kinematics, describing the acceleration that keeps an object moving in a circular path. This phenomenon occurs in numerous real-world systems, from planetary orbits to industrial centrifuges. In this problem, we explore the mathematical derivation of centripetal acceleration for a particle in uniform circular motion, starting from first principles of angular kinematics and vector geometry.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Definition of angular velocity ($\omega$) and its constancy in uniform circular motion.
2. Relationship between linear velocity ($v$), angular velocity ($\omega$), and radius ($R$).
3. Vector decomposition of velocity and acceleration in polar coordinates.
4. Geometric derivation of centripetal acceleration using infinitesimal displacement analysis.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to:
- Kinematics of rotational motion (angular displacement, velocity, acceleration).
- Dynamics of circular motion (centripetal force, Newton's second law).
- Vector calculus applications in physics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering:** Design of rotating machinery (e.g., turbines, centrifuges) where centripetal forces must be calculated for structural integrity.
- **Astronomy:** Calculation of orbital velocities and accelerations in celestial mechanics.
- **Transportation:** Banking of roads and tracks to provide centripetal force for vehicles.

##### Real-World Applications
1. **Particle Accelerators:** Charged particles moving in circular paths under magnetic fields experience centripetal acceleration.
2. **Amusement Rides:** Roller coasters and rotating platforms rely on centripetal acceleration for loop-the-loop maneuvers.
3. **Satellite Technology:** Geostationary satellites maintain orbit through balanced centripetal acceleration and gravity.

##### Problem Statement
A particle moves uniformly in a circular path of radius $R$ with constant angular velocity $\omega$.  
1. Starting from the fundamental definition of linear velocity in terms of angular velocity, derive the instantaneous linear velocity vector $\vec{v}$ as a function of time $t$, assuming initial angular position $\theta_0 = 0$.  
2. Using the time derivative of $\vec{v}$, derive the expression for centripetal acceleration $a_c$.  
3. Express $a_c$ solely in terms of $R$ and $\omega$.  
Given $R = 2  \text{m}$ and $\omega = 3  \text{rad/s}$, compute the numerical value of $a_c$.  
Express your final answer in meters per second squared ($\text{m/s}^2$), providing **only the numerical value** rounded to the nearest whole number.  

**Note:**  
- Use $\omega$ for angular velocity and $R$ for radius.  
- Trigonometric functions must be left unevaluated (e.g., $\sin(\theta)$).  
- Velocity and acceleration vectors must be expressed in component form.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Express position vector in Cartesian coordinates
The position vector of a particle in circular motion is:  
$$\vec{r}(t) = R \cos(\omega t)  \hat{\imath} + R \sin(\omega t)  \hat{\jmath}$$  
where $\hat{\imath}$ and $\hat{\jmath}$ are unit vectors along the $x$- and $y$-axes.

##### Step 2: Derive linear velocity vector
Linear velocity $\vec{v}$ is the time derivative of position:  
$$\vec{v}(t) = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = -R \omega \sin(\omega t)  \hat{\imath} + R \omega \cos(\omega t)  \hat{\jmath}.$$  
The magnitude of $\vec{v}$ is $v = \omega R$ (constant).

##### Step 3: Derive acceleration vector
Acceleration $\vec{a}$ is the time derivative of velocity:  
$$\vec{a}(t) = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = -R \omega^2 \cos(\omega t)  \hat{\imath} - R \omega^2 \sin(\omega t)  \hat{\jmath}.$$  

##### Step 4: Express acceleration in terms of position vector
Notice that:  
$$\vec{a}(t) = -\omega^2 \left[ R \cos(\omega t)  \hat{\imath} + R \sin(\omega t)  \hat{\jmath} \right] = -\omega^2 \vec{r}(t).$$  
The magnitude of $\vec{r}$ is $R$, so:  
$$|\vec{a}| = \omega^2 R.$$  

##### Step 5: Compute centripetal acceleration magnitude
The centripetal acceleration $a_c$ is the magnitude of $\vec{a}$:  
$$a_c = \omega^2 R.$$  

##### Step 6: Numerical evaluation
Substitute $R = 2  \text{m}$ and $\omega = 3  \text{rad/s}$:  
$$a_c = (3)^2 \times 2 = 9 \times 2 = 18.$$  
The numerical value is $18  \text{m/s}^2$, so the answer is $18$ (without units).

### Answer
$$\boxed{18}$$

### Problem 8
##### Background
Rotational motion describes how objects spin around an axis. Angular quantities such as displacement (θ), velocity (ω), and acceleration (α) follow kinematic principles analogous to linear motion.

##### Problem Statement
A disk initially rotates at 12 rad/s and slows down uniformly to 3 rad/s while rotating through an angular displacement of 9 radians. Determine the angular deceleration of the disk. Express your answer as an exact number in rad/s² and provide only the numerical value.

### Solution
We start with the rotational kinematics equation that relates angular velocities, angular displacement, and angular acceleration without involving time:

$$ \omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2 \alpha \theta $$

where:
- $\omega_i = 12  \text{rad/s}$ is the initial angular velocity,
- $\omega_f = 3  \text{rad/s}$ is the final angular velocity,
- $\theta = 9  \text{rad}$ is the angular displacement,
- $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration (which will be negative since the disk is slowing down).

Solve for $\alpha$:

$$ \alpha = \frac{\omega_f^2 - \omega_i^2}{2 \theta} $$

Substitute the given values:

$$ \alpha = \frac{(3)^2 - (12)^2}{2 \times 9} = \frac{9 - 144}{18} = \frac{-135}{18} = -\frac{135}{18} $$

Simplify the fraction:

$$ -\frac{135}{18} = -\frac{135 \div 9}{18 \div 9} = -\frac{15}{2}  \text{rad/s}^2 $$

The angular acceleration is $-\frac{15}{2}  \text{rad/s}^2$. Angular deceleration is defined as the magnitude of this negative acceleration:

$$ \text{angular deceleration} = \left| \alpha \right| = \left| -\frac{15}{2} \right| = \frac{15}{2}  \text{rad/s}^2 $$

The angular deceleration is $\frac{15}{2}  \text{rad/s}^2$. Since the problem requires the numerical value as an exact number, we express it as a fraction.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{15}{2}}$$

### Problem 9
##### Background
In automotive engineering, testing braking systems involves spinning a wheel to a specific angular velocity and measuring how it decelerates. The angular deceleration depends on the initial rotational speed and the angular distance covered during braking. Understanding the relationship between these quantities is essential for designing effective braking systems that can stop a vehicle safely.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conversion between units of angular velocity (revolutions per minute to radians per second).
2. Conversion between units of angular displacement (revolutions to radians).
3. Application of the rotational kinematics equation $\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta$ for constant angular acceleration.
4. Magnitude calculations for vector quantities like angular deceleration.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem integrates angular displacement, angular velocity, and angular acceleration within rotational kinematics. It reinforces how these quantities interrelate through fundamental kinematic equations, extending concepts from linear motion to rotational dynamics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The principles apply to mechanical engineering (brake design), transportation safety (stopping distances), and physics education (unit conversions and kinematics). The methodology is also used in robotics for controlling wheel motion and in aerospace engineering for gyroscopic systems.

##### Real-World Applications
Calculating angular deceleration is critical for:
- Designing automotive braking systems that meet safety standards.
- Determining the stopping distance of rotating components in industrial machinery.
- Optimizing the performance of electric vehicles by analyzing regenerative braking efficiency.
- Modeling the behavior of flywheels in energy storage systems.

##### Problem Statement
A test wheel rotates at an initial angular velocity of $n$ revolutions per minute (rpm). When brakes are applied, the wheel experiences constant angular deceleration and comes to rest after rotating through an angular displacement of $m$ revolutions. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the angular deceleration $\alpha$ in terms of $n$, $m$, and any necessary mathematical constants. Express your answer in units of rad/s².

**Answer Format Requirements:**  
- Provide an analytic expression using only the variables $n$ and $m$, and the constant $\pi$.  
- Simplify the expression fully.  
- Do not substitute numerical values for $\pi$.  
- Ensure the expression represents the magnitude (positive value) of angular deceleration.

### Solution
**Step 1: Convert initial angular velocity to radians per second.**  
Given:  
- Initial angular velocity = $n$ rpm.  
- 1 revolution = $2\pi$ radians.  
- 1 minute = 60 seconds.  

Convert $n$ revolutions per minute to radians per second:  

$$
\omega_i = n \cdot \frac{2\pi \text{ rad}}{1 \text{ rev}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ min}}{60 \text{ s}} = n \cdot \frac{2\pi}{60} = n \cdot \frac{\pi}{30} \text{ rad/s}.
$$


**Step 2: Convert angular displacement to radians.**  
Given:  
- Angular displacement = $m$ revolutions.  
- 1 revolution = $2\pi$ radians.  

Convert $m$ revolutions to radians:  

$$
\theta = m \cdot 2\pi \text{ rad}.
$$


**Step 3: Apply the rotational kinematics equation.**  
The wheel starts with angular velocity $\omega_i$ and stops ($\omega_f = 0$) under constant angular deceleration $\alpha$. The kinematic equation is:  

$$
\omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\theta.
$$
  
Substitute $\omega_f = 0$, $\omega_i = n\pi/30$, and $\theta = 2\pi m$:  

$$
0 = \left(n \cdot \frac{\pi}{30}\right)^2 + 2\alpha \cdot (2\pi m).
$$
  
Simplify:  

$$
0 = \frac{n^2 \pi^2}{900} + 4\pi m \alpha.
$$


**Step 4: Solve for angular deceleration $\alpha$.**  
Rearrange the equation to isolate $\alpha$:  

$$
4\pi m \alpha = -\frac{n^2 \pi^2}{900}.
$$
  
Divide both sides by $4\pi m$:  

$$
\alpha = -\frac{n^2 \pi^2}{900 \cdot 4\pi m} = -\frac{n^2 \pi}{3600 m}.
$$
  
The negative sign indicates deceleration. The magnitude (absolute value) is:  

$$
|\alpha| = \frac{n^2 \pi}{3600 m} \text{ rad/s}^2.
$$
  
This is the expression for the magnitude of the angular deceleration.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{n^{2} \pi}{3600 m}}$$

## rotational kinetic energy and dynamics

### Problem 0
##### Background
In many engineering applications, such as designing conveyor systems or roller coasters, understanding the motion of rolling objects is crucial. A common scenario involves a sphere rolling down an incline, which combines translational and rotational motion. This problem explores a variation where the sphere starts with an initial velocity, simulating real-world situations like a ball being launched onto a ramp.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conservation of mechanical energy.
2. Rotational kinetic energy for a solid sphere.
3. Rolling without slipping condition.
4. Relationship between linear and angular velocity.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects rotational dynamics with energy conservation, illustrating how rotational inertia (moment of inertia) affects translational motion. It also reinforces concepts from linear kinematics and dynamics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Essential for designing mechanical systems involving rolling elements (e.g., bearings, gears).
- **Sports Science**: Models the behavior of balls in sports like bowling or billiards on inclined surfaces.
- **Robotics**: Informs the control of spherical robots navigating uneven terrain.

##### Real-World Applications
- **Regenerative Braking Systems**: In electric vehicles, kinetic energy recovery during downhill motion relies on similar principles.
- **Material Handling**: Conveyor belts use rolling mechanisms to transport goods efficiently.
- **Geophysics**: Understanding how boulders roll down slopes aids in landslide prediction.

##### Problem Statement
A solid sphere of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is placed at the top of a straight incline with vertical height $h$. The sphere is given an initial linear speed $v_0$ directed *up* the incline and then released. The incline is sufficiently rough to ensure rolling without slipping throughout the motion. Derive an expression for the linear speed of the sphere when it reaches the bottom of the incline. Express your answer in terms of $v_0$, $g$ (acceleration due to gravity), and $h$.

### Solution
##### Step-by-Step Derivation

##### Step 1: Initial Energy Calculation
The total mechanical energy at the top of the incline is conserved since friction does no work (rolling without slipping). The initial energy comprises:
- **Gravitational potential energy**: $Mgh$.
- **Translational kinetic energy**: $\frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2$.
- **Rotational kinetic energy**: $\frac{1}{2}I\omega_0^2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the solid sphere.

For a solid sphere, $I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2$. Since the sphere rolls without slipping, the initial angular velocity $\omega_0$ relates to $v_0$ by $\omega_0 = \frac{v_0}{R}$. Substituting:

$$
\frac{1}{2}I\omega_0^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5}MR^2 \right) \left( \frac{v_0}{R} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5}Mv_0^2 = \frac{1}{5}Mv_0^2.
$$

Thus, the initial total energy $E_i$ is:

$$
E_i = Mgh + \frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2 + \frac{1}{5}Mv_0^2 = Mgh + \frac{7}{10}Mv_0^2.
$$


##### Step 2: Final Energy at the Bottom
At the bottom:
- Gravitational potential energy is $0$ (reference point).
- Translational kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2}Mv^2$, where $v$ is the final linear speed.
- Rotational kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$, with $\omega = \frac{v}{R}$ (rolling without slipping):

$$
\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5}MR^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{5}Mv^2.
$$

The final total energy $E_f$ is:

$$
E_f = \frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \frac{1}{5}Mv^2 = \frac{7}{10}Mv^2.
$$


##### Step 3: Apply Conservation of Energy
Since mechanical energy is conserved ($E_i = E_f$):

$$
Mgh + \frac{7}{10}Mv_0^2 = \frac{7}{10}Mv^2.
$$

Divide both sides by $M$:

$$
gh + \frac{7}{10}v_0^2 = \frac{7}{10}v^2.
$$


##### Step 4: Solve for Final Speed $v$
Rearrange the equation:

$$
\frac{7}{10}v^2 = gh + \frac{7}{10}v_0^2.
$$

Multiply both sides by $\frac{10}{7}$:

$$
v^2 = \frac{10}{7}gh + v_0^2.
$$

Take the square root:

$$
v = \sqrt{v_0^2 + \frac{10}{7}gh}.
$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{v_0^{2} + \frac{10}{7} g h}}$$

------
### Problem 1
##### Background
A uniform rod of length $L$ and mass $M$ is pivoted at one end, forming a physical pendulum. When released from a horizontal position, it swings downward under gravity. This scenario models real-world systems like falling crane booms, swinging baseball bats, or collapsing structures, where rotational kinetic energy and conservation laws determine motion dynamics.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conservation of mechanical energy (kinetic + potential).  
2. Rotational kinetic energy: $\frac{1}{2} I \omega^2$, with $I$ as moment of inertia.  
3. Moment of inertia for a uniform rod about one end: $I = \frac{1}{3} M L^2$.  
4. Gravitational potential energy for extended objects, referenced to the center of mass.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Extends simple pendulum concepts to extended objects (physical pendulums).  
- Connects to torque and angular acceleration in rotational dynamics.  
- Relates to harmonic motion for small-angle oscillations (though not used here).  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Predicts angular velocity in collapsing structures or rotating crane arms.  
- **Biomechanics**: Models limb motion (e.g., a falling arm pivoting at the shoulder).  
- **Meteorology**: Analogous to the dynamics of falling icicles or tree branches.  

##### Real-World Applications
- **Safety analysis**: Calculating impact speed of falling construction beams.  
- **Sports science**: Optimizing swing speed in golf clubs or baseball bats.  
- **Robotics**: Designing energy-efficient rotational motion for robotic arms.  

##### Problem Statement
A uniform rod of length $L$ and mass $M$ is pivoted frictionlessly at one end. Initially held horizontally at rest, it is released and swings downward. Derive an expression for its angular speed $\omega$ when it reaches the vertical position. Use conservation of mechanical energy and express $\omega$ solely in terms of $L$ and gravitational acceleration $g$.  

**Note**: The moment of inertia of a uniform rod about one end is $\frac{1}{3} M L^2$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Define energy conservation**  
Mechanical energy is conserved (no non-conservative forces). Initial energy ($E_i$) equals final energy ($E_f$):  
$$ E_i = E_f $$  
$$ K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f $$  
where $K$ is kinetic energy and $U$ is gravitational potential energy.  

**Step 2: Initial state (horizontal)**  
- Kinetic energy: $K_i = 0$ (released from rest).  
- Potential energy: Reference $U = 0$ at the pivot height in the vertical position. The center of mass (midpoint of the rod) is at height $L/2$ above the pivot:  
$$ U_i = M g \left( \frac{L}{2} \right) $$  

**Step 3: Final state (vertical)**  
- Potential energy: Center of mass is at pivot height, so $U_f = 0$.  
- Kinetic energy: Entirely rotational, with angular speed $\omega$ and moment of inertia $I = \frac{1}{3} M L^2$:  
$$ K_f = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{3} M L^2 \right) \omega^2 = \frac{1}{6} M L^2 \omega^2 $$  

**Step 4: Apply energy conservation**  
Substitute expressions into $K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f$:  
$$ 0 + M g \frac{L}{2} = \frac{1}{6} M L^2 \omega^2 + 0 $$  

**Step 5: Solve for $\omega$**  
Simplify the equation:  
$$ M g \frac{L}{2} = \frac{1}{6} M L^2 \omega^2 $$  
Divide both sides by $M$ ($M \neq 0$):  
$$ g \frac{L}{2} = \frac{1}{6} L^2 \omega^2 $$  
Multiply both sides by 6:  
$$ 6 \cdot g \frac{L}{2} = L^2 \omega^2 $$  
$$ 3 g L = L^2 \omega^2 $$  
Divide both sides by $L$ ($L \neq 0$):  
$$ 3 g = L \omega^2 $$  
Solve for $\omega$:  
$$ \omega^2 = \frac{3g}{L} $$  
$$ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{3g}{L}} $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{3g}{L}}}$$

### Problem 10
##### Background
In many sports and engineering applications, objects roll without slipping to conserve energy. Consider a thin hula hoop—a common toy—with uniform mass distribution. When rolled on a flat surface, it exhibits both translational and rotational motion. The hoop has mass $M$ and radius $R$, and at a specific moment, its center of mass moves with linear speed $v$ while rolling without slipping.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Relationship between linear and angular velocity in rolling without slipping.
3. Rotational kinetic energy formula.
4. Algebraic substitution and simplification.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Problem Statement
A thin hoop of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolls horizontally without slipping. At a given instant, its center of mass has linear speed $v$. Derive an expression for the rotational kinetic energy of the hoop. Express your answer symbolically using only $M$, $R$, and $v$.

### Solution
To solve this, we proceed step by step:

**Step 1: Recall the rotational kinetic energy formula**  
The rotational kinetic energy $K_{\text{rot}}$ for a rigid body is given by:  
$$ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^{2} $$  
where $I$ is the moment of inertia about the axis of rotation and $\omega$ is the angular velocity.

**Step 2: Determine the moment of inertia for a thin hoop**  
For a thin hoop rotating about its central axis (perpendicular to the plane of the hoop), all mass elements are at distance $R$ from the axis. Thus:  
$$ I = M R^{2} $$  

**Step 3: Apply the rolling-without-slipping condition**  
Rolling without slipping implies a direct relationship between linear speed $v$ and angular speed $\omega$:  
$$ v = R \omega $$  
Solving for $\omega$:  
$$ \omega = \frac{v}{R} $$  

**Step 4: Substitute into the kinetic energy formula**  
Substitute $I = M R^{2}$ and $\omega = \frac{v}{R}$ into $K_{\text{rot}}$:  
$$ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} (M R^{2}) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^{2} $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} M R^{2} \cdot \frac{v^{2}}{R^{2}} $$  
The $R^{2}$ terms cancel:  
$$ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} M v^{2} $$  

**Conclusion**:  
The rotational kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2} M v^{2}$, independent of $R$.

The attachment occurs instantaneously, with no external torque applied during the process. This scenario explores how adding mass affects rotational dynamics.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Conservation of angular momentum in isolated systems.
3. Rotational kinetic energy formulation.
4. Algebraic manipulation of rotational dynamics equations.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to torque and angular acceleration via Newton's second law for rotation.
- Relates to energy conservation principles when external work is absent.
- Extends to systems with variable moment of inertia (e.g., collapsing stars, figure skaters).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- Designing inertial dampers in vehicles or spacecraft to manage rotational energy during mass shifts.
- Modeling industrial processes like spin coating or rotational molding with material deposition.

##### Problem Statement
A uniform disk of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rotates about its central axis with initial angular velocity $\omega$. A point mass $m$ is instantaneously attached to the disk's edge, with no external torque acting during attachment. Derive an expression for the new rotational kinetic energy of the combined system (disk + point mass) after attachment. Express your answer in terms of $M$, $R$, $m$, and $\omega$.  
**Format Requirements**:  
- Use only the given symbols.  
- Write trigonometric functions as $\sin(\theta)$, $\cos(\theta)$, etc.  
- Express fractions as $\frac{a}{b}$, not $a/b$.  
- Enclose the entire expression in a single boxed answer.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Initial Angular Momentum  
The system is isolated (no external torque), so angular momentum $L$ is conserved. Initial angular momentum $L_i$ comes solely from the disk. The moment of inertia of a disk about its central axis is $\frac{1}{2}MR^2$. Thus:  
$$ L_i = I_{\text{disk}} \omega = \left( \frac{1}{2}MR^2 \right) \omega = \frac{1}{2}MR^2\omega $$

##### Step 2: Final Moment of Inertia  
After attaching the point mass $m$ at the edge (distance $R$ from the axis), the total moment of inertia $I_f$ is the sum of the disk's inertia and the point mass's inertia:  
$$ I_f = I_{\text{disk}} + I_{\text{point}} = \frac{1}{2}MR^2 + mR^2 = R^2 \left( \frac{1}{2}M + m \right) $$

##### Step 3: Conservation of Angular Momentum  
Let $\omega_f$ be the final angular velocity. Conservation of angular momentum gives:  
$$ L_i = L_f $$  
$$ \frac{1}{2}MR^2\omega = I_f \omega_f = R^2 \left( \frac{1}{2}M + m \right) \omega_f $$  
Solve for $\omega_f$:  
$$ \omega_f = \frac{\frac{1}{2}MR^2\omega}{R^2 \left( \frac{1}{2}M + m \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}M\omega}{\frac{1}{2}M + m} = \frac{M\omega}{M + 2m} $$

##### Step 4: New Rotational Kinetic Energy  
The rotational kinetic energy $K_f$ after attachment is:  
$$ K_f = \frac{1}{2} I_f \omega_f^2 $$  
Substitute $I_f$ and $\omega_f$:  
$$ K_f = \frac{1}{2} \left[ R^2 \left( \frac{1}{2}M + m \right) \right] \left( \frac{M\omega}{M + 2m} \right)^2 $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ K_f = \frac{1}{2} R^2 \left( \frac{M}{2} + m \right) \frac{M^2 \omega^2}{(M + 2m)^2} $$  
Note that $\frac{M}{2} + m = \frac{M + 2m}{2}$, so:  
$$ K_f = \frac{1}{2} R^2 \left( \frac{M + 2m}{2} \right) \frac{M^2 \omega^2}{(M + 2m)^2} = \frac{1}{4} R^2 \frac{M^2 \omega^2}{M + 2m} $$  
Final form:  
$$ K_f = \frac{M^2 R^2 \omega^2}{4(M + 2m)} $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \dfrac{ M^{2} R^{2} \omega^{2} }{ 4 \left( M + 2 m \right) } }$$

### Problem 12
##### Background
In mechanical engineering and physics, flywheels are used to store rotational energy. They are crucial in applications like energy recovery systems in hybrid vehicles and industrial machinery. A constant torque is applied to a flywheel to accelerate it from rest. Understanding the resulting angular displacement involves fundamental principles of rotational dynamics.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Newton's second law for rotation: $\tau = I\alpha$
- Kinematic equations for rotational motion under constant angular acceleration
- Relationship between angular displacement and revolutions: $N = \frac{\theta}{2\pi}$

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to linear motion analogs: torque ($\tau$) parallels force ($F$), moment of inertia ($I$) parallels mass ($m$), and angular acceleration ($\alpha$) parallels linear acceleration ($a$). The kinematic equation $\theta = \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2$ mirrors $s = \frac{1}{2}at^2$.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Calculating revolutions is essential for designing flywheel energy storage systems.
- **Applied Mathematics**: Solving differential equations of motion arises in control systems for rotational mechanisms.

##### Real-World Applications
- Regenerative braking in electric vehicles, where torque recovers kinetic energy as rotational energy in a flywheel.
- Industrial presses and punch machines, where flywheels deliver high torque pulses.

##### Problem Statement
A flywheel with moment of inertia $I$ about its central axis is initially at rest. Starting at $t=0$, a constant torque $\tau$ is applied. Derive an expression for the number of revolutions $N$ completed by time $t$.  
**Express $N$ symbolically in terms of $\tau$, $I$, and $t$.**  
*Follow these instructions precisely:*  
- Use $\alpha$ for angular acceleration and $\theta$ for angular displacement.  
- Express fractions using $\frac{a}{b}$ format.  
- Do **not** substitute numerical values for any constant.  
- The final answer must be a single analytic expression enclosed in $\boxed{}$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Apply Newton's second law for rotation**  
The torque $\tau$ causes angular acceleration $\alpha$:  
$$\tau = I \alpha$$  
Solve for $\alpha$:  
$$\alpha = \frac{\tau}{I}$$  

**Step 2: Use the kinematic equation for angular displacement**  
The flywheel starts from rest ($\omega_0 = 0$) and undergoes constant angular acceleration. The angular displacement $\theta$ at time $t$ is:  
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2$$  
Substitute $\alpha$ from Step 1:  
$$\theta = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\tau}{I} \right) t^2 = \frac{\tau t^2}{2I}$$  

**Step 3: Convert angular displacement to revolutions**  
One revolution equals $2\pi$ radians. The number of revolutions $N$ is:  
$$N = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \left( \frac{\tau t^2}{2I} \right) = \frac{\tau t^2}{4\pi I}$$  

**Verification via work-energy theorem**  
*Alternative derivation to confirm the result:*  
Work done by torque: $W = \tau \theta$.  
Change in kinetic energy: $\Delta K = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 - 0$.  
By work-energy theorem, $W = \Delta K$:  
$$\tau \theta = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2$$  
Using $\omega = \alpha t = \frac{\tau}{I} t$:  
$$\tau \theta = \frac{1}{2} I \left( \frac{\tau}{I} t \right)^2 = \frac{\tau^2 t^2}{2I}$$  
Solve for $\theta$:  
$$\theta = \frac{\tau t^2}{2I}$$  
Revolutions: $N = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} = \frac{\tau t^2}{4\pi I}$.  
Both methods yield identical results.  

**Final expression**  
The number of revolutions is:  
$$N = \frac{\tau t^2}{4\pi I}$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\tau t^{2}}{4\pi I}}$$

### Problem 13
##### Background
Rolling without slipping is a fundamental motion observed in many real-world systems, such as ball bearings in machinery, wheels of vehicles, and sports balls like basketballs or bowling balls. This motion combines translation and rotation, and the distribution of kinetic energy between these two forms is crucial for understanding energy efficiency and dynamics. For instance, in designing efficient conveyor systems or analyzing the motion of celestial bodies, knowing how energy partitions between rotation and translation helps optimize performance and predict behavior.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Rotational kinetic energy: $ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 $
- Translational kinetic energy: $ K_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 $
- Moment of inertia for a solid sphere: $ I = \frac{2}{5} M R^2 $
- Rolling without slipping condition: $ v = R \omega $
- Fractional energy calculations: ratio of rotational to total kinetic energy

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to conservation of energy in mechanical systems, rigid body dynamics, and the relationship between linear and angular motion. It extends concepts from linear kinematics to rotational analogs, reinforcing the parallel between force/torque and linear/angular momentum.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications

- **Manufacturing**: Designing spherical rollers in conveyor belts for efficient material handling.
- **Sports**: Analyzing the spin of a cricket ball or baseball to predict trajectory and bounce.
- **Renewable Energy**: Improving the efficiency of flywheel energy storage systems by understanding rotational inertia.

##### Problem Statement
A solid sphere of mass $ M $ and radius $ R $ rolls without slipping on a horizontal surface. At a specific instant, its center of mass has speed $ v $. Derive an expression for the fraction of the sphere's total kinetic energy that is rotational. Express your answer as a simplified fraction. Ensure all steps are justified from first principles, and use the following notation:  
- $ M $ for mass,  
- $ R $ for radius,  
- $ v $ for linear speed,  
- $ \omega $ for angular speed.  
The final answer must be a single simplified fraction with no variables.

### Solution
To find the fraction of total kinetic energy that is rotational, we first express the rotational and translational components of kinetic energy, then combine them to form the total kinetic energy, and finally compute the ratio.

**Step 1: Write the rotational kinetic energy**  
The rotational kinetic energy is given by:  
$$ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 $$  
where $ I $ is the moment of inertia of the solid sphere. For a solid sphere rotating about its center:  
$$ I = \frac{2}{5} M R^2 $$  
Substituting $ I $:  
$$ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \right) \omega^2 = \frac{1}{5} M R^2 \omega^2 $$

**Step 2: Apply rolling without slipping condition**  
Rolling without slipping implies $ v = R \omega $, so:  
$$ \omega = \frac{v}{R} $$  
Substitute into $ K_{\text{rot}} $:  
$$ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{5} M R^2 \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{5} M R^2 \cdot \frac{v^2}{R^2} = \frac{1}{5} M v^2 $$

**Step 3: Write the translational kinetic energy**  
The translational kinetic energy is:  
$$ K_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 $$

**Step 4: Find the total kinetic energy**  
Total kinetic energy $ K_{\text{total}} $ is the sum of translational and rotational components:  
$$ K_{\text{total}} = K_{\text{trans}} + K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 + \frac{1}{5} M v^2 $$  
To add these, use a common denominator (10):  
$$ K_{\text{total}} = \frac{5}{10} M v^2 + \frac{2}{10} M v^2 = \frac{7}{10} M v^2 $$

**Step 5: Compute the fraction of rotational kinetic energy**  
The fraction is $ \frac{K_{\text{rot}}}{K_{\text{total}}} $:  
$$ \frac{K_{\text{rot}}}{K_{\text{total}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{5} M v^2}{\frac{7}{10} M v^2} = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{10}{7} = \frac{10}{35} $$  
Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 5:  
$$ \frac{10}{35} = \frac{2}{7} $$  
Thus, the fraction is $ \frac{2}{7} $.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{2}{7}}$$

### Problem 14
##### Background
A playground merry-go-round is rotating freely with negligible friction about a fixed central axis. It has a moment of inertia $I_m$ about this axis and an initial angular velocity $\omega_i$. A child of mass $m$, initially standing at the edge of the merry-go-round at a radial distance $R$ from the center, moves inward to the exact center. This movement changes the system's rotational characteristics due to conservation laws.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Conservation of angular momentum in isolated systems.
- Calculation of moment of inertia for point masses.
- Relationship between angular velocity and moment of inertia.
- Application of rotational dynamics principles.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to torque and rotational work-energy theorems.
- Relates to center of mass motion and rigid body dynamics.
- Extends concepts of linear momentum conservation to rotational analogs.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications
- Design of amusement park rides requiring precise rotational control.
- Satellite attitude adjustment using internal mass redistribution.
- Sports science: Optimizing rotational speed in gymnastics and ice skating.

##### Problem Statement
A merry-go-round with moment of inertia $I_m$ rotates initially at angular velocity $\omega_i$. A child of mass $m$, modeled as a point mass, starts at the edge (radius $R$) and moves to the center. Derive an expression for the new angular velocity $\omega_f$ of the merry-go-round after the child reaches the center. Assume no external torques act on the system. Express $\omega_f$ symbolically in terms of $I_m$, $\omega_i$, $m$, and $R$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Apply conservation of angular momentum**  
Since no external torques act, the total angular momentum $L$ is conserved. Thus:  
$$ L_{\text{initial}} = L_{\text{final}} $$

**Step 2: Calculate initial angular momentum**  
- The merry-go-round contributes $I_m \omega_i$.  
- The child at radius $R$ has moment of inertia $m R^2$ and angular momentum $(m R^2) \omega_i$.  
- Total initial angular momentum:  
$$ L_{\text{initial}} = I_m \omega_i + m R^2 \omega_i = \omega_i (I_m + m R^2) $$

**Step 3: Calculate final angular momentum**  
- After moving to the center, the child's radius is $0$, so its moment of inertia is $m \cdot 0^2 = 0$.  
- Only the merry-go-round contributes: $I_m \omega_f$.  
- Total final angular momentum:  
$$ L_{\text{final}} = I_m \omega_f $$

**Step 4: Equate and solve for $\omega_f$**  
Set $L_{\text{initial}} = L_{\text{final}}$:  
$$ \omega_i (I_m + m R^2) = I_m \omega_f $$  
Solve for $\omega_f$:  
$$ \omega_f = \frac{\omega_i (I_m + m R^2)}{I_m} = \omega_i \left(1 + \frac{m R^2}{I_m}\right) $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\omega_i \left(1 + \frac{m R^{2}}{I_m}\right)}$$

### Problem 15
##### Background
In mechanical systems, pulleys are often used to change the direction of applied forces or transmit rotational motion. When a force is applied tangentially to a pulley, it creates a torque that causes angular acceleration. Understanding this relationship is essential for designing systems like cranes, elevators, and industrial winches where rotational dynamics govern performance.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Definition of torque: $\tau = F_{\text{tangential}} \cdot R$
- Relationship between torque and angular acceleration: $\tau = I\alpha$
- Newton's second law for rotational motion
- Rigid body dynamics with fixed axis rotation

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to linear motion concepts: tangential acceleration $a_t = R\alpha$
- Relates to energy methods: work done by torque $W = \int \tau  d\theta$, rotational kinetic energy $K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$
- Extends to systems with combined translation and rotation

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Robotics**: Precise motor control for robotic arms and joints
- **Aerospace**: Inertial properties of control surfaces and gyroscopic systems

##### Real-World Applications
- **Construction cranes**: Calculating required motor torque to lift loads at specific accelerations
- **Automotive systems**: Determining clutch engagement forces in manual transmissions
- **Wind turbines**: Analyzing startup torque needed to overcome rotor inertia

##### Problem Statement
A solid pulley with moment of inertia $I$ and radius $R$ is mounted on a frictionless axle. A constant tangential force $F$ is applied to the rim of the pulley as shown in the diagram. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the pulley. Express your answer exclusively in terms of $I$, $R$, and $F$.  
*(Assume no slipping or energy losses. The pulley starts from rest.)*

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify the torque**  
The torque $\tau$ about the pulley's axis is given by the tangential force multiplied by the lever arm (radius $R$):  
$$\tau = F \cdot R$$

**Step 2: Apply Newton's second law for rotation**  
The net torque causes angular acceleration according to:  
$$\tau = I \alpha$$  
where $I$ is the moment of inertia.

**Step 3: Substitute and solve for $\alpha$**  
Equate the expressions for torque from Steps 1 and 2:  
$$F R = I \alpha$$  
Solve for the angular acceleration $\alpha$:  
$$\alpha = \frac{F R}{I}$$

**Verification of units**  
- Force $F$ has units N = kg·m/s²  
- Radius $R$ has units m  
- Moment of inertia $I$ has units kg·m²  
Thus:  
$$\frac{F R}{I} = \frac{( \text{kg·m/s}^2 ) \cdot ( \text{m} )}{ \text{kg·m}^2 } = \frac{1}{\text{s}^2} = \text{rad/s}^2$$  
which matches the units for angular acceleration, confirming dimensional consistency.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{FR}{I}}$$

### Problem 16
##### Background
A uniform rod of mass $M$ and length $L$ is pivoted at one end. The rod is initially held horizontally at rest and then released. Gravity acts downward with acceleration $g$. As the rod swings downward, its rotational motion can be analyzed using energy principles.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Conservation of mechanical energy
- Rotational kinetic energy ($K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2$)
- Moment of inertia for a rod about one end ($I = \frac{1}{3}ML^2$)
- Gravitational potential energy relative to a reference point
- Angular velocity in rigid body dynamics

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects rotational dynamics to linear mechanics through energy conservation. It also reinforces the relationship between torque and angular acceleration (though not directly used here), and illustrates how potential energy transforms into rotational kinetic energy.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The principles apply to engineering (e.g., pendulum cranes in construction), biomechanics (limb movement during motion), and astronomy (dynamics of rotating celestial bodies). Energy conservation is fundamental across physics subfields, including thermodynamics and electromagnetism.

##### Real-World Applications
- Swing bridges or drawbridges rotating about a pivot
- Diving boards releasing potential energy into rotational motion
- Robotic arms in manufacturing where controlled rotation is critical

##### Problem Statement
The rod is released from rest in a horizontal position. Derive an expression for the angular speed $\omega$ of the rod when it reaches a position 30° below the horizontal. Use conservation of energy and express $\omega$ symbolically in terms of $g$ and $L$.  
**Note:** The moment of inertia of a uniform rod about one end is $\frac{1}{3}ML^2$. Set the pivot height as the reference point for gravitational potential energy.  
**Answer format:** Provide the expression for $\omega$ only. Use $\omega = \sqrt{\text{expression}}$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Define the reference frame and initial conditions**  
- Set the pivot point as the origin.  
- When horizontal (initial position), the center of mass (CM) is at $(x_{\text{CM}}, y_{\text{CM}}) = \left(\frac{L}{2}, 0\right)$, so gravitational potential energy $U_i = 0$.  
- Initial angular speed $\omega_i = 0$, so kinetic energy $K_i = 0$.  

**Step 2: Determine potential energy at 30° below horizontal**  
- At $\theta = 30^\circ$ below horizontal, the CM coordinates are:  
  $$  
  x_{\text{CM}} = \frac{L}{2} \cos(30^\circ), \quad y_{\text{CM}} = -\frac{L}{2} \sin(30^\circ)  
  $$  
  since the CM moves downward.  
- $\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$, so $y_{\text{CM}} = -\frac{L}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{L}{4}$.  
- Gravitational potential energy at this position:  
  $$  
  U_f = M g y_{\text{CM}} = M g \left(-\frac{L}{4}\right) = -\frac{1}{4} M g L  
  $$  

**Step 3: Express kinetic energy at final position**  
- Moment of inertia about pivot: $I = \frac{1}{3} M L^2$.  
- Rotational kinetic energy:  
  $$  
  K_f = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{3} M L^2\right) \omega^2 = \frac{1}{6} M L^2 \omega^2  
  $$  

**Step 4: Apply conservation of mechanical energy**  
- Initial total energy $E_i = U_i + K_i = 0$.  
- Final total energy $E_f = U_f + K_f$.  
- $E_i = E_f$:  
  $$  
  0 = -\frac{1}{4} M g L + \frac{1}{6} M L^2 \omega^2  
  $$  

**Step 5: Solve for $\omega$**  
- Rearrange the equation:  
  $$  
  \frac{1}{6} M L^2 \omega^2 = \frac{1}{4} M g L  
  $$  
- Divide both sides by $M$ ($M \neq 0$):  
  $$  
  \frac{1}{6} L^2 \omega^2 = \frac{1}{4} g L  
  $$  
- Multiply both sides by 6:  
  $$  
  L^2 \omega^2 = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{4} g L = \frac{6}{4} g L = \frac{3}{2} g L  
  $$  
- Divide both sides by $L^2$:  
  $$  
  \omega^2 = \frac{3}{2} g L \cdot \frac{1}{L^2} = \frac{3g}{2L}  
  $$  
- Take the square root:  
  $$  
  \omega = \sqrt{\frac{3g}{2L}}  
  $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{3g}{2L}}}$$

##### Problem Statement
A solid disk wheel of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolls without slipping on a stationary horizontal rail. The center of mass of the wheel accelerates horizontally with constant magnitude $a$. Determine the net torque acting on the wheel about its center of mass. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $M$, $R$, and $a$.

### Solution
To find the net torque about the center of mass, we apply Newton's second law for rotation and the condition for rolling without slipping. The net torque $\tau$ is given by:

$$\tau = I \alpha$$
where $I$ is the moment of inertia about the central axis, and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.

For a solid disk, the moment of inertia about its central axis is:
$$I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2$$

The wheel rolls without slipping, so the linear acceleration $a$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$ are related by:
$$a = R \alpha$$
Solving for $\alpha$:
$$\alpha = \frac{a}{R}$$

Substitute $I$ and $\alpha$ into the torque equation:
$$\tau = \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \left( \frac{a}{R} \right)$$

Simplify the expression:
$$\tau = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \cdot \frac{a}{R} = \frac{1}{2} M R a$$

This result arises because:
- The friction force at the point of contact provides the torque about the center of mass.
- Gravity, normal force, and axle forces act through the center of mass, contributing zero torque.
- The derived torque $\tau = \frac{1}{2} M R a$ is consistent with the linear acceleration $a$ and the disk's rotational inertia.

Thus, the net torque about the center of mass is $\frac{1}{2} M R a$.

### Problem 18
##### Background
A figure skater performs a spin on the ice. Her body (excluding any held weights) has a constant moment of inertia $I_0$ about her axis of rotation. She holds two weights, each of mass $m$, at specific distances from this axis. When she pulls her arms inward, the distances of the weights from the axis change, altering her total moment of inertia. This scenario models how rotational speed changes due to conservation of angular momentum, a principle observed in sports like figure skating, gymnastics, and diving, as well as in engineering systems such as satellite attitude control.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Conservation of angular momentum
- Moment of inertia for point masses and composite systems
- Unit conversion for angular velocity (revolutions per second to radians per second)

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem integrates rotational kinematics (angular velocity) with rotational dynamics (moment of inertia and torque-free motion). It also reinforces the relationship between linear and rotational quantities, such as the contribution of point masses to moment of inertia.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Biomechanics**: Illustrates how athletes manipulate body configuration to control rotational motion.
- **Aerospace Engineering**: Similar principles apply to spacecraft that adjust orientation by retracting/extending components (e.g., solar panels).

##### Real-World Applications
- **Sports Science**: Figure skaters and divers change their moment of inertia to control spin rates during performances.
- **Space Technology**: Satellites use inertia adjustments for stabilization without thrusters, conserving fuel.

##### Problem Statement
A figure skater has a moment of inertia $I_0$ (excluding held weights) and spins at an initial angular velocity of $\omega_i$ revolutions per second. She holds two weights, each of mass $m$. Initially, each weight is at a distance $r_i$ from her axis of rotation. She then pulls the weights inward to a distance $r_f$ from the axis. Derive an expression for her final angular velocity in radians per second. Express your answer in terms of $I_0$, $m$, $r_i$, $r_f$, $\omega_i$, and $\pi$.

### Solution
The solution proceeds via conservation of angular momentum, as no external torque acts on the skater. The initial and final angular momenta must be equal:  
$$ L_i = L_f $$  
The total angular momentum $L = I \omega$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\omega$ is the angular velocity.  

**Step 1: Convert initial angular velocity to radians per second**  
The initial angular velocity is given in revolutions per second. Since 1 revolution equals $2\pi$ radians:  
$$ \omega_{i,\text{rad}} = \omega_i \times 2\pi $$  

**Step 2: Compute the initial moment of inertia**  
The total initial moment of inertia $I_i$ includes the skater's body ($I_0$) and the two weights. Each weight is a point mass at distance $r_i$, contributing $m r_i^2$ to the moment of inertia. Thus:  
$$ I_i = I_0 + 2 \left( m r_i^2 \right) = I_0 + 2m r_i^2 $$  

**Step 3: Compute the final moment of inertia**  
After pulling the weights in, each weight is at distance $r_f$. The final moment of inertia $I_f$ is:  
$$ I_f = I_0 + 2 \left( m r_f^2 \right) = I_0 + 2m r_f^2 $$  

**Step 4: Apply conservation of angular momentum**  
Initial angular momentum: $ L_i = I_i \omega_{i,\text{rad}} $  
Final angular momentum: $ L_f = I_f \omega_f $  
Setting $L_i = L_f$:  
$$ I_i \omega_{i,\text{rad}} = I_f \omega_f $$  
Substitute the expressions for $I_i$, $I_f$, and $\omega_{i,\text{rad}}$:  
$$ \left( I_0 + 2m r_i^2 \right) \left( \omega_i \times 2\pi \right) = \left( I_0 + 2m r_f^2 \right) \omega_f $$  

**Step 5: Solve for the final angular velocity $\omega_f$**  
Isolate $\omega_f$:  
$$ \omega_f = \frac{ \left( I_0 + 2m r_i^2 \right) \left( \omega_i \times 2\pi \right) }{ I_0 + 2m r_f^2 } $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ \omega_f = \frac{ 2\pi \omega_i \left( I_0 + 2m r_i^2 \right) }{ I_0 + 2m r_f^2 } $$  
This is the final angular velocity in radians per second.  

**Conclusion**: The expression for $\omega_f$ is derived from fundamental principles, with unit conversion and moment of inertia calculations incorporated.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{2\pi\omega_i\left(I_0 + 2mr_i^{2}\right)}{I_0 + 2mr_f^{2}}}$$

### Problem 19
##### Background
In many mechanical systems, such as industrial rollers or vehicle wheels, objects transition from sliding to rolling motion due to friction. Consider a solid cylinder initially sliding on a horizontal surface without rotation. Frictional forces act on the cylinder until it achieves pure rolling motion (rolling without slipping). This problem explores the energy and momentum principles governing this transition.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conservation of angular momentum  
2. Moment of inertia for solid cylinders  
3. Condition for rolling without slipping ($v = R\omega$)  
4. Torque and angular impulse  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects linear kinematics (velocity, acceleration) to rotational dynamics (angular velocity, torque).  
- Integrates work-energy concepts with impulse-momentum theorems.  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Mechanical Engineering:** Analyzes energy dissipation in braking systems.  
- **Robotics:** Models wheel-ground interactions for mobile robots.  
- **Sports Science:** Explains ball-surface interactions in bowling or curling.  

##### Real-World Applications

- Optimization of regenerative braking in electric vehicles.  
- Safety analysis of cargo securing systems during transportation.  

##### Problem Statement
A solid cylinder of mass $M$ and radius $R$ slides on a horizontal surface with initial linear velocity $v_0$ without any rotation. Due to kinetic friction with the surface, it transitions to pure rolling motion. Using conservation of angular momentum about the point of contact between the cylinder and the surface, derive an expression for the final linear velocity $v$ of the cylinder. Express $v$ solely in terms of $v_0$.  

The moment of inertia of a solid cylinder about its central axis is $\frac{1}{2}MR^2$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify conservation principle**  
The net external torque about the point of contact (Point P) is zero because:  
- Gravitational force acts at the center of mass (CM), and the vector from P to CM is vertical, while gravity is vertical → torque is $\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}_g = 0$.  
- Normal force acts at P → $\vec{r} = 0$ → torque $= 0$.  
- Friction acts at P → torque $= 0$.  
Thus, angular momentum about P is conserved.  

**Step 2: Initial angular momentum**  
At initial state (sliding without rotation):  
- Velocity of CM $= v_0$ (horizontal).  
- Distance from P to line of CM velocity $= R$ (perpendicular).  
- Initial rotational angular momentum $= 0$.  
Angular momentum about P:  
$$ L_i = M v_0 R \quad (\text{clockwise}) $$  

**Step 3: Final angular momentum**  
At final state (pure rolling):  
- Velocity of CM $= v$ (horizontal).  
- Angular velocity $\omega$ satisfies $v = R \omega$.  
- Rotational inertia about CM: $I_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{2} M R^2$.  
Angular momentum about P has two components:  
1. Translational: $M v R$ (clockwise).  
2. Rotational: $I_{\text{cm}} \omega = \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right) = \frac{1}{2} M R v$ (clockwise).  
Total final angular momentum:  
$$ L_f = M v R + \frac{1}{2} M R v = \frac{3}{2} M R v $$  

**Step 4: Apply conservation**  
$$ L_i = L_f $$  
$$ M v_0 R = \frac{3}{2} M R v $$  
Solve for $v$:  
$$ v_0 = \frac{3}{2} v $$  
$$ v = \frac{2}{3} v_0 $$  

**Conclusion**  
The final linear velocity is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the initial sliding velocity. This result is independent of $M$, $R$, and friction coefficients, relying solely on geometry and inertia distribution.

##### Problem Statement
A flywheel with moment of inertia $I$ starts from rest ($\omega_0 = 0$). A constant torque $\tau$ is applied for time $t$. Derive an expression for the final rotational kinetic energy $K$ in terms of $I$, $\tau$, and $t$ only.  
*Follow these instructions precisely:*  
- Express your answer as a single simplified fraction  
- Use the variables $I$, $\tau$, and $t$ exactly as defined  
- Do **not** substitute any numerical values

### Solution
**Step 1: Determine angular acceleration**  
From Newton's second law for rotation:  
$$ \tau = I \alpha $$  
Solving for angular acceleration:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{\tau}{I} $$  

**Step 2: Find final angular velocity**  
Using the kinematic equation for constant angular acceleration (initial angular velocity $\omega_0 = 0$):  
$$ \omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t $$  
Substitute $\alpha$:  
$$ \omega = 0 + \left( \frac{\tau}{I} \right) t = \frac{\tau t}{I} $$  

**Step 3: Express rotational kinetic energy**  
The rotational kinetic energy is:  
$$ K = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 $$  
Substitute $\omega$:  
$$ K = \frac{1}{2} I \left( \frac{\tau t}{I} \right)^2 $$  

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
$$ K = \frac{1}{2} I \cdot \frac{\tau^2 t^2}{I^2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\tau^2 t^2}{I} $$  
$$ K = \frac{\tau^2 t^2}{2I} $$  
This is the final expression for the rotational kinetic energy.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\tau^{2} t^{2}}{2I}}$$

### Problem 20
##### Background
A solid cylinder of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is launched up a $30^\circ$ incline with an initial center-of-mass speed $v$. The cylinder rolls without slipping, meaning the point of contact with the incline has zero instantaneous velocity. As the cylinder ascends, gravitational potential energy increases while its kinetic energy decreases. The maximum height corresponds to the point where all initial kinetic energy is converted to potential energy.  

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Moment of inertia for solid cylinders ($I = \frac{1}{2}MR^2$)  
3. Rolling-without-slipping condition ($v = R\omega$)  
4. Gravitational potential energy ($U_g = Mgh$)

- Extends energy conservation principles to rigid-body rotation  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications

- Optimizing the launch angle and speed for cylindrical projectiles in physics demonstrations  

##### Problem Statement  
A solid cylinder (mass $M$, radius $R$) rolls without slipping up a $30^\circ$ incline with initial center-of-mass speed $v$. Derive an expression for the maximum vertical height $h$ reached by the cylinder's center of mass. Express $h$ symbolically in terms of $v$, $g$ (acceleration due to gravity), and necessary numerical constants.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify initial kinetic energy**  
The total initial kinetic energy ($K_i$) has translational and rotational components. For rolling without slipping, angular velocity $\omega$ relates to linear velocity $v$ via $\omega = v/R$.  
- Translational kinetic energy: $K_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1}{2}Mv^2$  
- Rotational kinetic energy: $K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$  
The moment of inertia for a solid cylinder about its central axis is $I = \frac{1}{2}MR^2$. Substituting $\omega = v/R$:  
$$
K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2}MR^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}Mv^2
$$  
Total initial kinetic energy:  
$$
K_i = K_{\text{trans}} + K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \frac{1}{4}Mv^2 = \frac{3}{4}Mv^2
$$

**Step 2: Define final energy state**  
At maximum height $h$, the cylinder momentarily stops ($v = 0$, $\omega = 0$), so kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy increase is $U_f = Mgh$. Initial potential energy is set to $U_i = 0$ at the base.  

**Step 3: Apply energy conservation**  
Mechanical energy is conserved because static friction (which enables rolling without slipping) does no work. Thus:  
$$
K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f
$$  
Substituting values:  
$$
\frac{3}{4}Mv^2 + 0 = 0 + Mgh
$$  
Solving for $h$:  
$$
Mgh = \frac{3}{4}Mv^2 \implies h = \frac{3v^2}{4g}
$$  

**Note**: The incline angle ($30^\circ$) does not appear in the final expression because energy conservation depends only on the vertical height change, not the path slope.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{3v^{2}}{4g}}$$

### Problem 21
##### Background
Flywheels are mechanical energy storage devices used in applications like regenerative braking systems and industrial machinery. A flywheel with moment of inertia $I$ is mounted on a frictionless axle. A constant torque $\tau$ is applied to the flywheel, starting from rest. Understanding the work-energy relationship in rotational systems is crucial for designing such energy storage devices.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Definition of rotational work: $W = \int \tau  d\theta$
2. Torque-angular acceleration relationship: $\tau = I \alpha$
3. Rotational kinematics under constant torque: $\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha \Delta\theta$
4. Work-energy theorem for rotation: $W = \Delta K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 - \frac{1}{2} I \omega_0^2$

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to linear dynamics through analogous relationships: torque (τ) ↔ force (F), angular displacement (θ) ↔ linear displacement (s), moment of inertia (I) ↔ mass (m).
- Extends energy conservation principles to rotational systems.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- Physics: Fundamental connection between torque, energy, and angular motion.

##### Real-World Applications

- Stabilizing power grid frequency fluctuations.
- Emergency power backup systems for data centers.

##### Problem Statement
A flywheel with moment of inertia $I$ starts from rest. A constant torque $\tau$ is applied about its central axis. Derive an expression for the total work $W$ done by the torque after the flywheel completes exactly $N$ full revolutions. Use the work-energy theorem for rotational motion and express your answer solely in terms of $\tau$ and $N$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Apply work-energy theorem**  
The work-energy theorem for rotation states that the net work done equals the change in rotational kinetic energy:  
$$ W = \Delta K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega_f^2 - \frac{1}{2} I \omega_0^2 $$  
Since the flywheel starts from rest, $\omega_0 = 0$. Thus:  
$$ W = \frac{1}{2} I \omega_f^2 \quad (1) $$  

**Step 2: Relate final angular velocity to angular displacement**  
Under constant torque, angular acceleration $\alpha$ is constant. The rotational kinematics equation is:  
$$ \omega_f^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2 \alpha \Delta \theta $$  
With $\omega_0 = 0$ and $\Delta \theta = 2\pi N$ radians ($N$ revolutions):  
$$ \omega_f^2 = 2 \alpha (2\pi N) = 4\pi N \alpha \quad (2) $$  

**Step 3: Relate torque to angular acceleration**  
Newton's second law for rotation gives:  
$$ \tau = I \alpha \quad \Rightarrow \quad \alpha = \frac{\tau}{I} \quad (3) $$  

**Step 4: Substitute equations (2) and (3) into (1)**  
Combine (2) and (3):  
$$ \omega_f^2 = 4\pi N \left( \frac{\tau}{I} \right) $$  
Substitute into (1):  
$$ W = \frac{1}{2} I \left( 4\pi N \frac{\tau}{I} \right) $$  

**Step 5: Simplify the expression**  
The moment of inertia $I$ cancels out:  
$$ W = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4\pi N \tau = 2\pi N \tau $$  
Thus, the total work done is $2\pi N \tau$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{2\pi N \tau}$$

### Problem 22
##### Background
In many real-world applications, such as designing braking systems for vehicles or analyzing the motion of sports balls on inclined surfaces, understanding the acceleration of rolling objects is crucial. Consider a hollow spherical shell, which is a common model for objects like soccer balls or thin-walled containers. The shell has a mass $M$ and a radius $R$. It is released from rest on an inclined plane that makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. The shell rolls down the incline without slipping due to static friction between the shell and the incline.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Newton's second law for linear and rotational motion
- Moment of inertia for symmetric objects
- Rolling without slipping condition
- Torque and angular acceleration
- Vector decomposition of forces

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem integrates concepts from linear kinematics (acceleration), dynamics (force analysis), and rotational motion (torque and moment of inertia). It also reinforces the relationship between linear and angular quantities.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Designing inclines for material transport systems.
- **Sports Science**: Analyzing the motion of balls on turf or slopes.
- **Geophysics**: Modeling rock or debris movement on hillsides.

##### Real-World Applications
- Calculating the acceleration of a bowling ball on a lane with an oil gradient.
- Predicting the speed of a cylindrical water tank rolling down a ramp during emergency drainage.
- Optimizing the angle of conveyor belts in mining operations to control material flow speed.

##### Problem Statement
A hollow spherical shell of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolls without slipping down an incline at an angle $\theta$ to the horizontal. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$. Derive an expression for the linear acceleration $a$ of the center of mass of the shell along the incline. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $g$ and $\theta$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify forces and setup equations**  
The forces acting on the shell are:  
- Gravitational force: $Mg$ downward.  
- Normal force: $N$ perpendicular to the incline.  
- Static friction: $f$ parallel to the incline, opposing motion.  

Decompose gravity into components parallel and perpendicular to the incline:  
- Parallel component: $Mg \sin\theta$ (down the incline).  
- Perpendicular component: $Mg \cos\theta$.  

Apply Newton's second law along the incline (x-direction):  
$$ Mg \sin\theta - f = Ma \tag{1} $$  
where $a$ is the linear acceleration of the center of mass.  

Apply Newton's second law perpendicular to the incline (y-direction):  
$$ N - Mg \cos\theta = 0 \tag{2} $$  
(since there is no acceleration perpendicular to the incline).  

**Step 2: Rotational dynamics**  
The friction force $f$ provides a torque about the center of mass. The torque $\tau$ is given by:  
$$ \tau = f R $$  
(since the force acts tangentially at the point of contact, and the lever arm is $R$).  

The torque causes angular acceleration $\alpha$ according to:  
$$ \tau = I \alpha $$  
where $I$ is the moment of inertia about the center of mass.  

For a hollow spherical shell, the moment of inertia is:  
$$ I = \frac{2}{3} M R^2 \tag{3} $$  

Thus:  
$$ f R = \left( \frac{2}{3} M R^2 \right) \alpha \tag{4} $$  

**Step 3: Rolling without slipping condition**  
For rolling without slipping, the linear acceleration $a$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$ are related by:  
$$ a = R \alpha \tag{5} $$  

**Step 4: Solve for acceleration**  
Substitute $\alpha = a / R$ from (5) into (4):  
$$ f R = \frac{2}{3} M R^2 \left( \frac{a}{R} \right) $$  
Simplify:  
$$ f R = \frac{2}{3} M R a $$  
$$ f = \frac{2}{3} M a \tag{6} $$  

Substitute (6) into (1):  
$$ Mg \sin\theta - \frac{2}{3} M a = M a $$  

Divide both sides by $M$ (assuming $M \neq 0$):  
$$ g \sin\theta - \frac{2}{3} a = a $$  

Combine like terms:  
$$ g \sin\theta = a + \frac{2}{3} a $$  
$$ g \sin\theta = \frac{5}{3} a $$  

Solve for $a$:  
$$ a = \frac{3}{5} g \sin\theta $$  

**Conclusion**  
The linear acceleration of the hollow spherical shell is $\frac{3}{5} g \sin\theta$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{3}{5}g\sin\theta}$$

### Problem 23
##### Background  
In a physics laboratory, a uniform disk of mass $M_d$ and radius $R$ is mounted on a frictionless horizontal axle. A light, inextensible string is wrapped tightly around the disk's rim, and a block of mass $m$ is attached to the free end of the string. The system is released from rest, allowing the block to descend under gravity, which causes the disk to rotate. This setup models real-world devices like winches or elevators, where rotational and translational motion are coupled.

##### Knowledge Points Tested  
1. Newton's second law for linear motion.  
2. Newton's second law for rotational motion ($\tau = I\alpha$).  
3. Moment of inertia for a uniform disk about its central axis.  
4. Kinematic constraint between linear and angular acceleration ($a = R\alpha$).  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections  
This problem integrates concepts from rotational dynamics (torque, moment of inertia, angular acceleration) and linear dynamics (forces, acceleration). It extends the application of Newton's laws to systems with combined translation and rotation, emphasizing energy conservation principles implicitly through the work done by tension.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections  
- **Engineering**: Models the mechanics of pulley systems in cranes or elevators.  
- **Technology**: Illustrates principles behind regenerative braking in electric vehicles, where rotational energy is converted to electrical energy.  

##### Real-World Applications  
- **Construction Winches**: Used to lift materials vertically via a rotating drum.  
- **Yoyo Dynamics**: Demonstrates how string unwinding from a central axis induces rotation.  
- **Fitness Equipment**: Cable machines use similar mechanisms to provide resistance.  

##### Problem Statement  
The disk (mass $M_d$, radius $R$) rotates freely about a frictionless axle. A block of mass $m$ hangs vertically from the string wrapped around the disk's rim. When released, the block descends, unwinding the string and causing the disk to rotate. Derive an expression for the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the disk. Express $\alpha$ symbolically in terms of $m$, $M_d$, $R$, and the acceleration due to gravity $g$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify Forces and Torques**  
- The block experiences two forces: gravity ($mg$ downward) and tension ($T$ upward).  
- The disk experiences a torque due to tension. The tension force acts tangentially at the rim, so $\tau = TR$.  

**Step 2: Apply Newton's Second Law to the Block**  
The net force on the block causes linear acceleration $a$ downward:  
$$ mg - T = ma \quad (1) $$  

**Step 3: Apply Newton's Second Law to the Disk**  
The torque $\tau$ produces angular acceleration $\alpha$:  
$$ \tau = I \alpha \quad (2) $$  
The moment of inertia $I$ for a uniform disk about its central axis is:  
$$ I = \frac{1}{2} M_d R^2 $$  
Substitute $\tau = TR$ and $I$ into Equation (2):  
$$ TR = \left( \frac{1}{2} M_d R^2 \right) \alpha \quad (3) $$  

**Step 4: Relate Linear and Angular Acceleration**  
The string unwinds without slipping, so the linear acceleration $a$ of the block equals the tangential acceleration at the disk's rim:  
$$ a = R\alpha \quad (4) $$  

**Step 5: Solve the System of Equations**  
From Equation (3), solve for tension $T$:  
$$ T = \frac{1}{2} M_d R \alpha \quad (5) $$  
Substitute Equation (4) into Equation (1):  
$$ mg - T = m(R\alpha) \quad (6) $$  
Substitute Equation (5) into Equation (6):  
$$ mg - \frac{1}{2} M_d R \alpha = m R \alpha $$  
Rearrange to isolate $\alpha$:  
$$ mg = m R \alpha + \frac{1}{2} M_d R \alpha $$  
$$ mg = R \alpha \left( m + \frac{M_d}{2} \right) $$  
$$ \alpha = \frac{mg}{R \left( m + \frac{M_d}{2} \right)} $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{mg}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{m + \frac{M_d}{2}} = \frac{mg}{R} \cdot \frac{2}{2m + M_d} = \frac{2mg}{R(2m + M_d)} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The angular acceleration of the disk is $\frac{2mg}{R(2m + M_d)}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{2mg}{R\left(2m + M_d\right)}}$$

##### Background
A playground merry-go-round is rotating freely about a fixed frictionless vertical axis at its center. It has a moment of inertia $I_0$ about this axis and is initially rotating with angular velocity $\omega_0$. A sandbag is dropped vertically onto the merry-go-round from rest (with respect to the ground) at a point located a distance $d$ from the center. The sandbag adheres to the surface upon impact. This scenario explores how the rotation changes when mass is added abruptly to a rotating system.

##### Problem Statement
A merry-go-round with moment of inertia $I_0$ rotates freely at angular velocity $\omega_0$ about a fixed vertical axis through its center. A sandbag of mass $m$ is dropped vertically from rest (relative to the ground) at a distance $d$ from the center and sticks to the merry-go-round. Derive an expression for the new angular velocity $\omega_f$ of the system immediately after the sandbag adheres. Express $\omega_f$ symbolically in terms of $I_0$, $\omega_0$, $m$, and $d$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify conservation laws**  
The system (merry-go-round + sandbag) is isolated with respect to external torques about the vertical axis because:  
- The axis is frictionless and fixed, so no external torque acts.  
- The sandbag is dropped vertically with no initial horizontal velocity, so its initial angular momentum about the axis is zero.  
Thus, angular momentum is conserved about the axis:  
$$ L_{\text{initial}} = L_{\text{final}} $$

**Step 2: Calculate initial angular momentum**  
- The merry-go-round has angular momentum $I_0 \omega_0$.  
- The sandbag is dropped vertically from rest, so its linear velocity has no tangential component relative to the axis. Its angular momentum about the axis is $m v_\perp r = m \cdot 0 \cdot d = 0$.  
Total initial angular momentum is:  
$$ L_{\text{initial}} = I_0 \omega_0 $$

**Step 3: Calculate final angular momentum**  
After the sandbag sticks:  
- The merry-go-round and sandbag rotate together as a single rigid body with new moment of inertia $I_f$.  
- The sandbag (point mass) contributes $m d^2$ to the moment of inertia.  
Total moment of inertia becomes:  
$$ I_f = I_0 + m d^2 $$  
Final angular momentum is:  
$$ L_{\text{final}} = I_f \omega_f = (I_0 + m d^2) \omega_f $$

**Step 4: Apply angular momentum conservation**  
Set $L_{\text{initial}} = L_{\text{final}}$:  
$$ I_0 \omega_0 = (I_0 + m d^2) \omega_f $$

**Step 5: Solve for $\omega_f$**  
Rearrange to isolate $\omega_f$:  
$$ \omega_f = \frac{I_0 \omega_0}{I_0 + m d^2} $$  
This is the new angular velocity after the sandbag adheres.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{I_0 \omega_0}{I_0 + m d^2}}$$

### Problem 25
##### Background  
A uniform ladder of mass $M$ and length $L$ is initially leaning against a smooth (frictionless) vertical wall at an angle $\theta$ to the vertical. The bottom of the ladder rests on a horizontal floor that provides sufficient static friction to prevent slipping. The ladder is released from rest. This scenario explores the rotational dynamics of a rigid body under the influence of gravity and constraint forces.

##### Knowledge Points Tested  
- Torque and angular acceleration in rotational dynamics.  
- Moment of inertia of a rigid body.  
- Newton's second law for translational and rotational motion.  
- Kinematics of rigid body rotation about a fixed axis.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections  
This problem connects to static equilibrium (initial unstable equilibrium), conservation of energy (though not used here), and rotational kinematics (relation between angular acceleration and linear acceleration of the center of mass).  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections  
The dynamics of a falling ladder models real-world scenarios in engineering (e.g., stability of structures, robotics) and physics (e.g., rotational motion in constrained systems).  

##### Real-World Applications  
Understanding this system is crucial for safety in construction (e.g., ladder stability), mechanical design (e.g., deployable structures), and analyzing the motion of articulated systems in biomechanics.  

##### Problem Statement  
The ladder is released from rest. Derive the initial angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the ladder. Express your answer analytically in terms of $g$ (acceleration due to gravity), $L$ (length of the ladder), and $\theta$ (angle between the ladder and the vertical).

### Solution
The ladder rotates about the fixed point of contact with the floor (point $A$) due to sufficient static friction preventing slipping. The moment of inertia of a uniform rod of mass $M$ and length $L$ about one end is:  
$$ I_A = \frac{1}{3} M L^2 $$  

The only force producing a torque about $A$ is the weight $Mg$, acting downward at the center of mass (midpoint of the ladder). The line of action of the weight is a horizontal distance $\frac{L}{2} \sin \theta$ from $A$ (since $\theta$ is the angle with the vertical). The weight produces a clockwise torque that increases $\theta$, so it is positive:  
$$ \tau_{\text{weight}} = Mg \cdot \frac{L}{2} \sin \theta $$  

The normal force from the wall is horizontal and passes through $A$ (as its line of action is perpendicular to the wall and intersects the pivot), so it exerts zero torque. The normal force and friction at $A$ act at the pivot, so their torques are zero. The net torque is:  
$$ \tau_{\text{net}} = Mg \frac{L}{2} \sin \theta $$  

Applying Newton's second law for rotation about $A$:  
$$ \tau_{\text{net}} = I_A \alpha $$  
$$ Mg \frac{L}{2} \sin \theta = \left( \frac{1}{3} M L^2 \right) \alpha $$  

Solve for $\alpha$:  
$$ Mg \frac{L}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{1}{3} M L^2 \alpha $$  
Divide both sides by $M$ and $L$:  
$$ g \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{1}{3} L \alpha $$  
Multiply both sides by 3:  
$$ \frac{3g}{2} \sin \theta = L \alpha $$  
Thus:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{3g \sin \theta}{2L} $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{3g\sin\theta}{2L}}$$

### Problem 26
##### Background
In a physics demonstration, a solid cylinder and a solid sphere, each with identical mass $M$ and radius $R$, roll without slipping on parallel horizontal tracks. Both achieve the same constant linear speed $v$ after being propelled by identical mechanisms. The moment of inertia for a solid cylinder about its central axis is $I_{\text{cyl}} = \frac{1}{2}MR^2$, and for a solid sphere about its diameter is $I_{\text{sph}} = \frac{2}{5}MR^2$.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Rotational kinetic energy: $K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2$.
2. Rolling without slipping: $v = R\omega$.
3. Moment of inertia for symmetric rigid bodies.
4. Ratio derivation using symbolic parameters.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects rotational dynamics to energy conservation principles, as the total kinetic energy of a rolling object combines translational ($\frac{1}{2}Mv^2$) and rotational components. It also reinforces torque and angular momentum concepts.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Rotational energy distribution is critical in mechanical engineering (e.g., flywheel energy storage) and biomechanics (e.g., analyzing gait cycles where limbs rotate). In sports science, it explains why different balls (spheres vs. cylinders) behave uniquely when rolling.

##### Real-World Applications
- **Transportation Design**: Engineers optimize wheel moments of inertia to balance rotational energy for fuel efficiency.
- **Manufacturing**: Conveyor systems use cylindrical rollers, while robotic joints often employ spherical components; energy efficiency depends on rotational inertia.
- **Everyday Example**: A can (cylinder) and a marble (sphere) rolled with the same speed exhibit different rotational energies, affecting how they interact with surfaces.

##### Problem Statement
Derive the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy of the cylinder to the rotational kinetic energy of the sphere. Express your answer as a simplified fraction in terms of the given parameters $M$, $R$, and $v$.  
**Answer Format Requirements**:  
- Use $\omega_{\text{cyl}}$ and $\omega_{\text{sph}}$ for angular speeds.  
- Express the ratio as a single fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers with no common factors.  
- Do not substitute numerical values for physical constants.

### Solution
**Step 1: Relate linear speed to angular speed**  
Both objects roll without slipping, so:  
$$v = R \omega_{\text{cyl}} \quad \text{and} \quad v = R \omega_{\text{sph}}$$  
Solving for angular speeds:  
$$\omega_{\text{cyl}} = \frac{v}{R}, \quad \omega_{\text{sph}} = \frac{v}{R}$$  

**Step 2: Write rotational kinetic energy expressions**  
For the cylinder:  
$$K_{\text{cyl}} = \frac{1}{2} I_{\text{cyl}} \omega_{\text{cyl}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2$$  
For the sphere:  
$$K_{\text{sph}} = \frac{1}{2} I_{\text{sph}} \omega_{\text{sph}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2$$  

**Step 3: Simplify the energy expressions**  
Simplify $K_{\text{cyl}}$:  
$$K_{\text{cyl}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \cdot \frac{v^2}{R^2} = \frac{1}{4} M v^2$$  
Simplify $K_{\text{sph}}$:  
$$K_{\text{sph}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \cdot \frac{v^2}{R^2} = \frac{1}{5} M v^2$$  

**Step 4: Derive the ratio**  
Ratio of rotational kinetic energies:  
$$\frac{K_{\text{cyl}}}{K_{\text{sph}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} M v^2}{\frac{1}{5} M v^2} = \frac{1/4}{1/5} = \frac{5}{4}$$  
The mass $M$, radius $R$, and speed $v$ cancel out, leaving $\frac{5}{4}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{5}{4}}$$

### Problem 27
##### Background
In sports like bowling or billiards, a ball often starts by sliding across a surface before friction causes it to transition to pure rolling. Consider a solid spherical ball of mass $M$ and radius $R$ launched horizontally with an initial translational velocity $v_0$ but with no initial rotation. The surface has a coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu$. The ball experiences constant kinetic friction opposing its motion, which simultaneously slows its linear motion and induces rotation.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Newton's second law for linear and rotational motion
- Moment of inertia for solid spheres
- Torque and angular acceleration
- Condition for pure rolling (no-slip condition)
- Kinematics with constant acceleration

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem integrates linear dynamics (friction, center-of-mass acceleration) with rotational dynamics (torque, angular acceleration) and connects to energy conservation principles, as the work done by friction converts translational kinetic energy to rotational kinetic energy.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The sliding-to-rolling transition is crucial in mechanical engineering (e.g., vehicle traction control), robotics (wheel-ground interaction), and materials science (studying frictional wear in bearings).

##### Real-World Applications
- **Automotive safety**: Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) prevent wheels from sliding by modulating friction to maintain rolling.
- **Sports equipment design**: Optimizing surface friction in bowling lanes or golf greens to control ball behavior.
- **Space exploration**: Rover wheels on planetary surfaces must transition smoothly from sliding to rolling on loose terrain.

##### Problem Statement
The ball begins sliding at $t=0$ with initial linear velocity $v_0$ and zero angular velocity. Derive an expression for the time $t$ at which the ball starts rolling without slipping. Express your answer symbolically using only $v_0$, $\mu$, and $g$ (acceleration due to gravity). Do not include $M$ or $R$ in your final expression.

**Answer format requirements**:  
- Use the exact symbols $v_0$, $\mu$, and $g$.  
- Provide a single simplified fraction.  
- Do not include units.

### Solution
**Step 1: Analyze forces and linear motion**  
The kinetic friction force opposes sliding: $f_k = \mu N$, where $N$ is the normal force. For horizontal motion with no vertical acceleration, $N = Mg$. Thus:  
$$f_k = \mu Mg$$  
This force decelerates the center of mass. By Newton's second law:  
$$M a_{\text{cm}} = -f_k \implies a_{\text{cm}} = -\mu g$$  
The linear velocity decreases linearly with time:  
$$v(t) = v_0 + a_{\text{cm}} t = v_0 - \mu g t \quad (1)$$  

**Step 2: Analyze torque and angular motion**  
Friction exerts a torque about the center of mass. The lever arm is $R$, so:  
$$\tau = f_k R = \mu Mg R$$  
For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia is $I_{\text{cm}} = \frac{2}{5} M R^2$. By Newton's second law for rotation:  
$$\tau = I_{\text{cm}} \alpha \implies \mu Mg R = \left( \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \right) \alpha$$  
Solving for angular acceleration:  
$$\alpha = \frac{\mu Mg R}{\frac{2}{5} M R^2} = \frac{5 \mu g}{2 R} \quad (2)$$  
The angular velocity increases linearly from rest:  
$$\omega(t) = \alpha t = \frac{5 \mu g}{2 R} t \quad (3)$$  

**Step 3: Apply the no-slip condition**  
Pure rolling begins when the linear velocity matches the tangential velocity due to rotation:  
$$v(t) = R \omega(t) \quad (4)$$  
Substitute equations (1) and (3) into (4):  
$$v_0 - \mu g t = R \left( \frac{5 \mu g}{2 R} t \right)$$  
Simplify the right side:  
$$v_0 - \mu g t = \frac{5 \mu g}{2} t$$  

**Step 4: Solve for time**  
Isolate terms with $t$:  
$$v_0 = \mu g t + \frac{5 \mu g}{2} t = \mu g t \left( 1 + \frac{5}{2} \right) = \mu g t \cdot \frac{7}{2}$$  
Solve for $t$:  
$$t = \frac{v_0}{\mu g \cdot \frac{7}{2}} = \frac{2 v_0}{7 \mu g}$$  
The mass $M$ and radius $R$ cancel out, as required.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{2v_0}{7\mu g}}$$

------
### Problem 28
##### Background
A yo-yo is a common toy that demonstrates rotational motion principles. When dropped, the string unwinds from the central axle, causing both translational and rotational motion. This problem models a yo-yo as a solid cylinder of mass $M$ and radius $R$, with a lightweight string wound tightly around its circumference. The free end of the string is fixed to a high ceiling, and the yo-yo is released from rest at height $h$ above the floor. The string unwinds without slipping under gravitational acceleration $g$.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Newton's second law for translational motion  
2. Rotational analog of Newton's second law (torque and angular acceleration)  
3. Moment of inertia for solid cylinders  
4. Constraint equations for rolling/unwinding without slipping  
5. Relationship between linear and angular acceleration  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to linear kinematics through center-of-mass motion  
- Extends work-energy theorem to rotational kinetic energy  
- Relates to angular momentum conservation in isolated systems  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering:** Cable unwinding dynamics in construction cranes  
- **Sports Science:** Analysis of throwing mechanics (e.g., hammer throw)  
- **Biomechanics:** Tendon unwinding in joint movements  

##### Real-World Applications
1. Industrial cable spooling systems  
2. Emergency descent devices using friction-controlled unwinding  
3. Space tether deployment mechanisms  
4. Yo-yo despin devices for satellite stabilization  

##### Problem Statement
Derive the vertical acceleration $a_{\text{cm}}$ of the center of mass of the yo-yo immediately after release. Express your answer symbolically in terms of gravitational acceleration $g$ and fundamental constants. Use the following notation:  
- $M$: Mass of cylinder  
- $R$: Radius of cylinder  
- $g$: Gravitational acceleration  

The string remains vertical throughout the motion. Assume no air resistance and perfect unwinding without slipping.

### Solution
**Step 1: Forces and Torques**  
The forces acting on the yo-yo are:  
- Gravity: $Mg$ downward  
- Tension: $T$ upward  

Apply Newton's second law for translational motion (downward positive):  
$$ M g - T = M a_{\text{cm}} \quad (1) $$

**Step 2: Rotational Dynamics**  
The tension force provides torque about the center of mass. For unwinding without slipping, the torque $\tau$ is:  
$$ \tau = T R $$  
The rotational inertia of a solid cylinder about its central axis is:  
$$ I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 $$  
Apply the rotational analog of Newton's second law:  
$$ \tau = I \alpha $$  
$$ T R = \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \alpha \quad (2) $$

**Step 3: Constraint Equation**  
The no-slip condition requires that the vertical acceleration of the string equals the tangential acceleration at the rim:  
$$ a_{\text{cm}} = R \alpha \quad (3) $$  
This is because the string unwinds at the same rate as the rim's tangential motion.

**Step 4: Solve the System**  
Substitute $\alpha$ from (3) into (2):  
$$ T R = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \left( \frac{a_{\text{cm}}}{R} \right) $$  
Simplify:  
$$ T R = \frac{1}{2} M R a_{\text{cm}} $$  
$$ T = \frac{1}{2} M a_{\text{cm}} \quad (4) $$  

Substitute (4) into (1):  
$$ M g - \frac{1}{2} M a_{\text{cm}} = M a_{\text{cm}} $$  

Divide both sides by $M$ (assuming $M \neq 0$):  
$$ g - \frac{1}{2} a_{\text{cm}} = a_{\text{cm}} $$  
$$ g = a_{\text{cm}} + \frac{1}{2} a_{\text{cm}} $$  
$$ g = \frac{3}{2} a_{\text{cm}} $$  

**Step 5: Final Expression**  
Solve for $a_{\text{cm}}$:  
$$ a_{\text{cm}} = \frac{2}{3} g $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{2g}{3}}$$

------
### Problem 29
##### Background
In sports such as bowling or billiards, spherical objects often roll without slipping due to friction with the surface. This motion combines translation and rotation, leading to a total kinetic energy that depends on both linear and angular motion. Understanding how energy relates to momentum in such systems is crucial for predicting object behavior in real-world applications like vehicle dynamics or planetary motion.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Rotational kinetic energy and its relationship to linear kinetic energy.
2. Moment of inertia for symmetric rigid bodies.
3. Rolling without slipping condition (relating linear velocity to angular velocity).
4. Conservation of energy principles.
5. Definition of linear momentum and its dependence on mass and velocity.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem integrates concepts from rotational dynamics (moment of inertia, angular velocity) and translational motion (linear momentum, kinetic energy). It reinforces the principle that total kinetic energy for rolling objects has distinct translational and rotational components, which must be combined using fundamental physics laws.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Designing braking systems for vehicles requires understanding how kinetic energy converts to other forms during deceleration.
- **Sports Science**: Analyzing the motion of balls in games like baseball or cricket involves similar energy-momentum relationships to predict trajectories and impacts.
- **Astronomy**: Simplified models of celestial bodies (e.g., asteroids) rolling or tumbling in space use analogous dynamics.

##### Real-World Applications
- **Automotive Safety**: Crash simulations use momentum-energy relations to design crumple zones that absorb kinetic energy.
- **Robotics**: Wheeled robots rolling without slipping on surfaces must manage energy distribution between motors and wheels.
- **Manufacturing**: Quality control for spherical bearings involves verifying rolling motion properties under specified energy conditions.

##### Problem Statement
A uniform solid sphere of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolls without slipping on a horizontal surface. The sphere has a total kinetic energy $K$, which includes both translational and rotational components. The moment of inertia for a solid sphere about its center is $\frac{2}{5} M R^2$. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the linear momentum of the sphere in terms of $K$, $M$, and $R$.  
*Express your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression.*  
*Note: Use $\omega$ for angular velocity and $v$ for linear velocity where needed.*

### Solution
The linear momentum $p$ of the sphere is defined as $p = Mv$, where $v$ is the linear velocity of the center of mass. To express $p$ in terms of $K$, $M$, and $R$, we must relate $v$ to the total kinetic energy $K$.

The total kinetic energy $K$ consists of translational and rotational components:
$$ K = K_{\text{trans}} + K_{\text{rot}} $$
where $K_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1}{2} M v^2$ and $K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2$. The moment of inertia $I$ for a solid sphere is given as $I = \frac{2}{5} M R^2$.

Since the sphere rolls without slipping, the linear velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\omega$ are related by:
$$ \omega = \frac{v}{R} $$

Substitute $I$ and $\omega$ into $K_{\text{rot}}$:
$$ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \cdot \frac{v^2}{R^2} = \frac{1}{5} M v^2 $$

Now express the total kinetic energy $K$:
$$ K = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 + \frac{1}{5} M v^2 = M v^2 \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{5} \right) = M v^2 \left( \frac{5}{10} + \frac{2}{10} \right) = M v^2 \cdot \frac{7}{10} $$
Thus:
$$ K = \frac{7}{10} M v^2 $$

Solve for $v^2$:
$$ v^2 = \frac{10K}{7M} $$

The linear momentum is $p = Mv$. To express $p$ in terms of $v^2$:
$$ p = Mv = M \sqrt{v^2} = M \sqrt{ \frac{10K}{7M} } $$
Simplify the expression:
$$ p = M \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{10K}{7M} } = \sqrt{ M^2 \cdot \frac{10K}{7M} } = \sqrt{ \frac{10K M}{7} } $$

The magnitude of the linear momentum is therefore:
$$ p = \sqrt{ \frac{10 K M}{7} } $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{10KM}{7}}}$$

------
### Problem 3
##### Background
Consider a pulley system used in engineering applications, such as elevators or cranes, where rotational inertia significantly affects motion. A pulley with a given moment of inertia and radius is mounted on a frictionless axle. Two masses are suspended by a massless, inextensible rope that passes over the pulley without slipping. When released, the system accelerates due to the net force and torque.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Newton's second law for linear motion
- Rotational dynamics (torque and angular acceleration)
- Moment of inertia and its role in rotational motion
- Constraint equations linking linear and angular kinematics (no-slip condition)

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to energy conservation (rotational kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$ and gravitational potential energy) and rigid body dynamics. It also reinforces vector analysis of forces and torques.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Design of pulley systems in mechanical lifts, where moment of inertia impacts acceleration and safety margins.
- **Biomechanics**: Modeling joint movements with rotational inertia in limbs during motion.
- **Aerospace**: Deployment mechanisms for payloads using cable systems with inertial components.

##### Real-World Applications
- Elevator counterweights: Pulley inertia affects acceleration profiles and motor sizing.
- Construction cranes: Rotational inertia influences load acceleration during lifting operations.
- Automotive systems: Inertia in belt-driven components (e.g., alternators) affects engine response.

##### Problem Statement
Two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ (with $m_2 > m_1$) are suspended vertically by a massless, inextensible rope that passes over a pulley of radius $R$. The pulley has a moment of inertia $I$ about its rotation axis. The rope does not slip. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the acceleration $a$ of the masses when the system is released from rest. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $m_1$, $m_2$, $I$, $R$, and the gravitational acceleration $g$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Define forces and tensions**  
Let $T_1$ be the tension in the rope supporting $m_1$, and $T_2$ be the tension supporting $m_2$. Assume $m_2$ accelerates downward with magnitude $a$, so $m_1$ accelerates upward with magnitude $a$.

**Step 2: Apply Newton's second law to each mass**  
For $m_1$ (upward acceleration):  
$$ T_1 - m_1 g = m_1 a \quad \text{(1)} $$  
For $m_2$ (downward acceleration):  
$$ m_2 g - T_2 = m_2 a \quad \text{(2)} $$  

**Step 3: Analyze torque and angular acceleration of the pulley**  
The net torque on the pulley is $(T_2 - T_1)R$ (since $T_2$ exerts a counterclockwise torque and $T_1$ exerts a clockwise torque). The moment of inertia is $I$, and the angular acceleration is $\alpha$. By Newton's second law for rotation:  
$$ (T_2 - T_1)R = I \alpha \quad \text{(3)} $$  

**Step 4: Relate linear and angular acceleration**  
The no-slip condition implies $a = R\alpha$. Substitute into (3):  
$$ (T_2 - T_1)R = I \left(\frac{a}{R}\right) $$  
Simplify to:  
$$ T_2 - T_1 = \frac{I a}{R^2} \quad \text{(4)} $$  

**Step 5: Solve the system of equations**  
Add equations (1) and (2):  
$$ (T_1 - m_1 g) + (m_2 g - T_2) = m_1 a + m_2 a $$  
$$ T_1 - T_2 + (m_2 - m_1)g = (m_1 + m_2)a \quad \text{(5)} $$  
Rearrange equation (4):  
$$ T_2 - T_1 = \frac{I a}{R^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_1 - T_2 = -\frac{I a}{R^2} \quad \text{(6)} $$  
Substitute (6) into (5):  
$$ -\frac{I a}{R^2} + (m_2 - m_1)g = (m_1 + m_2)a $$  
Solve for $a$:  
$$ (m_2 - m_1)g = a \left( m_1 + m_2 + \frac{I}{R^2} \right) $$  
$$ a = \frac{(m_2 - m_1)g}{m_1 + m_2 + \frac{I}{R^2}} $$

### Problem 30
##### Background
In a new experimental transportation system, cylindrical rollers made of solid steel are used to carry loads. These rollers are designed to roll without slipping on horizontal surfaces and can ascend ramps to reach elevated platforms. Consider a solid cylindrical roller of mass $M$ and radius $R$ initially rolling without slipping on a horizontal surface with a center-of-mass speed $v$. It encounters a ramp inclined at an angle $\theta$ ($0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$) to the horizontal. The ramp surface provides sufficient friction to ensure the cylinder continues to roll without slipping as it ascends. The goal is to determine the maximum vertical height the center of mass of the cylinder reaches above its initial level.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects rotational dynamics to translational motion by requiring the combination of rotational and translational kinetic energy. It also reinforces the concept that static friction in rolling without slipping does no work, enabling energy conservation. Additionally, it relates to torque and angular acceleration, though energy methods provide the most efficient solution.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Designing ramps and rollers in material handling systems, such as conveyor belts or roller coasters, requires predicting motion under constraints like rolling without slipping.

##### Problem Statement
A uniform solid cylinder of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is rolling without slipping on a horizontal surface with a center-of-mass speed $v$. It encounters a ramp inclined at an angle $\theta$ to the horizontal. The ramp surface ensures the cylinder continues to roll without slipping. Derive an expression for the maximum vertical height $h$ above the initial horizontal surface that the center of mass of the cylinder reaches. Express $h$ in terms of $v$, $g$ (acceleration due to gravity), and any necessary constants. 

**Answer Format Requirements**:  
- Provide only the final expression for $h$ in the boxed answer.  
- Use $g$ for gravity and $v$ for speed.  
- Express fractions using `\frac{}{}` (e.g., `\frac{1}{2}`).  
- Do not include units in the final answer.  
- Trigonometric functions must be written in terms of their standard names (e.g., $\sin$, $\cos$) without degree symbols.  
- If applicable, use $\exp(x)$ for exponentials and $\ln$ for natural logarithms.  
- The expression must be simplified and exact.

### Solution
To solve this problem, we apply the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. Since the cylinder rolls without slipping, static friction acts, but it does no work (as there is no relative motion at the point of contact). Thus, mechanical energy is conserved. The initial mechanical energy equals the final mechanical energy.

**Step 1: Express initial kinetic energy.**  
The initial kinetic energy ($K_i$) has two components: translational and rotational.  
- Translational kinetic energy: $\frac{1}{2} M v^2$.  
- Rotational kinetic energy: $\frac{1}{2} I \omega^2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\omega$ is the angular speed.  

For a solid cylinder about its central axis, $I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2$.  
Due to rolling without slipping, $\omega = \frac{v}{R}$.  
Substitute $I$ and $\omega$:  
$$
\text{Rotational kinetic energy} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} M v^2 = \frac{1}{4} M v^2.
$$
Total initial kinetic energy:  
$$
K_i = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 + \frac{1}{4} M v^2 = \frac{3}{4} M v^2.
$$

**Step 2: Express initial and final potential energy.**  
Set the initial horizontal surface as the reference point for gravitational potential energy, so $U_i = 0$.  
At the maximum height $h$, the center of mass is at height $h$ above this reference. Thus, $U_f = M g h$.

**Step 3: Apply conservation of mechanical energy.**  
At the initial point: Total energy $E_i = K_i + U_i = \frac{3}{4} M v^2 + 0$.  
At the maximum height, the cylinder comes to rest instantaneously (both translationally and rotationally), so $K_f = 0$ and $U_f = M g h$. Thus, $E_f = 0 + M g h$.  
Conservation of energy gives:  
$$
E_i = E_f \implies \frac{3}{4} M v^2 = M g h.
$$

**Step 4: Solve for $h$.**  
Divide both sides by $M$ (assuming $M \neq 0$):  
$$
\frac{3}{4} v^2 = g h.
$$
Solve for $h$:  
$$
h = \frac{3 v^2}{4 g}.
$$

**Conclusion:**  
The maximum vertical height $h$ is independent of the ramp angle $\theta$, the mass $M$, and the radius $R$. This occurs because energy conservation depends only on the initial kinetic energy and the vertical displacement, not on the path or incline angle. The derivation confirms that $h = \frac{3 v^2}{4 g}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{3v^{2}}{4g}}$$

### Problem 31
##### Background
A physical pendulum is a rigid body that pivots around a fixed point and oscillates under gravity. Unlike a simple pendulum, its motion depends on the distribution of mass. Consider a uniform disk pivoted at a point on its rim, which creates a unique rotational system. When displaced and released, the disk swings back toward equilibrium, converting gravitational potential energy into rotational kinetic energy.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conservation of mechanical energy (potential to kinetic energy conversion).  
2. Moment of inertia calculations for rigid bodies (using the parallel axis theorem).  
3. Rotational kinetic energy and angular velocity relationships.  
4. Geometry of circular motion for center-of-mass height changes.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to torque and angular acceleration in rotational dynamics.  
- Extends the concept of a simple pendulum to rigid bodies with distributed mass.  
- Relates to small-angle oscillations but remains valid for arbitrary displacements.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Design of pendulum-based instruments (e.g., seismometers or clock escapements).  
- **Astronomy**: Modeling the rotation of celestial bodies under gravitational torques.  
- **Materials Science**: Stress analysis in rotating disk components (e.g., flywheels).

##### Real-World Applications
- **Flywheel Energy Storage**: Disks pivoted at the rim mimic the energy transfer in mechanical flywheels used for regenerative braking.  
- **Exercise Equipment**: Rotary inertia systems in spin bikes or rowing machines utilize similar rotational principles.  
- **Geophysics**: Tilted geological strata undergoing gravitational realignment.

##### Problem Statement
A uniform disk of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is pivoted at a point on its rim. The disk is displaced from its equilibrium (vertical) position by an initial angle $\theta_0$ and released from rest. Derive an expression for the angular speed $\omega$ of the disk when it reaches its lowest point (equilibrium position).  

Express $\omega$ symbolically in terms of $g$ (acceleration due to gravity), $R$, and $\theta_0$. Use exact analytic form, simplified with rational coefficients.  
**Notation Requirements**:  
- Use `\cos` for cosine.  
- Use `\sqrt{}` for square roots.  
- Omit degree symbols for angles.  
- Express fractions as `\frac{a}{b}`.

### Solution
**Step 1: Moment of inertia about pivot**  
The moment of inertia about the disk's center (perpendicular to plane) is $I_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{2} M R^2$. The pivot is on the rim, a distance $R$ from the center. By the parallel axis theorem:  
$$ I = I_{\text{cm}} + M d^2 = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 + M R^2 = \frac{3}{2} M R^2 $$

**Step 2: Initial potential energy**  
At displacement $\theta_0$, the center of mass (CM) height $h$ above the lowest point is found from geometry. The vertical drop from pivot to CM is $R$, so the height increase is:  
$$ h = R - R \cos\theta_0 = R(1 - \cos\theta_0) $$  
Initial kinetic energy is zero (released from rest). Initial potential energy:  
$$ U_i = M g h = M g R (1 - \cos\theta_0) $$

**Step 3: Energy conservation at lowest point**  
At equilibrium ($\theta = 0$), $h = 0$ (reference for potential energy). All energy is rotational kinetic:  
$$ K_f = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{3}{2} M R^2 \right) \omega^2 = \frac{3}{4} M R^2 \omega^2 $$  
Conservation of mechanical energy:  
$$ U_i + 0 = 0 + K_f $$  
$$ M g R (1 - \cos\theta_0) = \frac{3}{4} M R^2 \omega^2 $$

**Step 4: Solve for $\omega$**  
Divide both sides by $M$ and rearrange:  
$$ g R (1 - \cos\theta_0) = \frac{3}{4} R^2 \omega^2 $$  
$$ \omega^2 = \frac{4 g (1 - \cos\theta_0)}{3 R} $$  
Take the positive root (angular speed magnitude):  
$$ \omega = \sqrt{ \frac{4 g (1 - \cos\theta_0)}{3 R} } $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{4g(1 - \cos\theta_0)}{3R}}}$$

### Problem 32
##### Background

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Moment of inertia for solid spheres.  
3. Kinematic relationship for rolling without slipping.  
4. Trigonometry relating incline distance to height.  
5. Work-energy principles for non-conservative forces (friction does no work here due to no slipping).

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to linear kinematics (deceleration on inclines).  
- Extends energy conservation to rotational systems.  
- Relies on torque and angular acceleration concepts from rotational dynamics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Problem Statement
A solid sphere of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolls without slipping up an incline angled at $\theta$ to the horizontal. The sphere's center of mass has an initial linear velocity $v$ directed up the incline. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$. Derive an expression for the distance $d$ the sphere travels along the incline before coming to rest. Use the following parameters where necessary: $M$, $R$, $v$, $\theta$, and $g$.  

**Answer Format Requirements:**  
- Express your final answer as a single analytic expression.  
- Use $\sin \theta$ for trigonometric functions (angles in radians).  
- Simplify all fractions completely (e.g., $\frac{a}{b}$, not $a/b$).  
- Do not substitute numerical values for constants or evaluate transcendental functions.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify Initial Kinetic Energy**  
The sphere has both translational and rotational kinetic energy. The moment of inertia for a solid sphere about its center is $I = \frac{2}{5} M R^2$. For rolling without slipping, the angular velocity $\omega$ relates to linear velocity $v$ by $\omega = \frac{v}{R}$.  
- Translational kinetic energy: $\frac{1}{2} M v^2$  
- Rotational kinetic energy: $\frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{5} M v^2$  
- Total initial kinetic energy:  
$$ KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 + \frac{1}{5} M v^2 = \frac{7}{10} M v^2 $$  

**Step 2: Apply Energy Conservation**  
When the sphere stops, all kinetic energy converts to gravitational potential energy. The vertical height gained $h$ relates to distance $d$ along the incline by $h = d \sin \theta$.  
- Final potential energy: $PE = M g h = M g d \sin \theta$  
- Initial potential energy is $0$ (reference point).  
- Friction does no work (no slipping), so mechanical energy is conserved:  
$$ KE_{\text{initial}} = PE $$  
$$ \frac{7}{10} M v^2 = M g d \sin \theta $$  

**Step 3: Solve for Distance $d$**  
Isolate $d$:  
$$ d = \frac{\frac{7}{10} M v^2}{M g \sin \theta} = \frac{7 v^2}{10 g \sin \theta} $$  
The mass $M$ cancels, and the expression is independent of radius $R$ due to energy partitioning in rolling without slipping.  

**Conclusion**  
The distance traveled depends on initial velocity $v$, gravitational acceleration $g$, incline angle $\theta$, and the inertia distribution (reflected in the $\frac{7}{10}$ coefficient).

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{7 v^{2}}{10 g \sin \theta}}$$

### Problem 33
##### Background
Physical pendulums are rigid bodies that oscillate about a pivot point under gravity. The period of oscillation depends on the mass distribution, characterized by the moment of inertia.

When displaced from equilibrium and released, the rod undergoes small oscillations due to gravitational torque.

- Extends linear oscillation concepts (e.g., spring-mass systems) to rotational systems
- Relates to energy methods (kinetic energy = $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$, potential energy = $Mgh$)

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications

##### Problem Statement
A thin uniform rod of mass $M$ and length $L$ is suspended from a frictionless pivot at one end. The moment of inertia about its center of mass is $I_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{12}ML^2$.  
a) Use the parallel axis theorem to derive the moment of inertia $I$ about the pivot.  
b) When displaced by angle $\theta$ (radians) from vertical, show that gravity exerts a restoring torque proportional to $\sin\theta$.  
c) Apply Newton's second law for rotation and the small angle approximation ($\sin\theta \approx \theta$) to derive the angular frequency $\omega$ of oscillation.  
d) Hence, find the period $T$ of small oscillations.  
Express $T$ solely in terms of $L$ and $g$ (acceleration due to gravity).

### Solution
##### Step-by-Step Derivation

##### a) Moment of Inertia about Pivot
The parallel axis theorem states:  
$$ I = I_{\text{cm}} + M d^2 $$  
where $d$ is the distance from the center of mass to the pivot. The center of mass is at $L/2$:  
$$ d = \frac{L}{2} $$  
Substitute $I_{\text{cm}}$ and $d$:  
$$ I = \frac{1}{12}ML^2 + M \left( \frac{L}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{12}ML^2 + \frac{1}{4}ML^2 $$  
Combine terms:  
$$ I = \left( \frac{1}{12} + \frac{3}{12} \right)ML^2 = \frac{4}{12}ML^2 = \frac{1}{3}ML^2 $$  

##### b) Restoring Torque
Gravitational force $Mg$ acts downward at the center of mass. The perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of force is $\frac{L}{2} \sin\theta$:  
$$ \tau = - \left( Mg \cdot \frac{L}{2} \sin\theta \right) $$  
The negative sign indicates restoration toward $\theta = 0$. Thus, $\tau \propto \sin\theta$.  

##### c) Equation of Motion and Angular Frequency
Newton's second law for rotation:  
$$ \tau = I \alpha = I \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} $$  
Substitute $\tau$ and $I$:  
$$ \frac{1}{3}ML^2 \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = -Mg \frac{L}{2} \sin\theta $$  
Divide both sides by $M$:  
$$ \frac{1}{3}L^2 \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = -g \frac{L}{2} \sin\theta $$  
Apply small angle approximation ($\sin\theta \approx \theta$):  
$$ \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = -\left( \frac{3g}{2L} \right) \theta $$  
This is simple harmonic motion with $\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = -\omega^2 \theta$, so:  
$$ \omega^2 = \frac{3g}{2L} \implies \omega = \sqrt{\frac{3g}{2L}} $$  

##### d) Period of Oscillation
Period $T$ relates to angular frequency by $T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$:  
$$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{2L}{3g}} $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{2L}{3g}}}$$

### Problem 34
##### Background
Rolling without slipping is a common phenomenon in mechanical systems, from vehicle wheels to industrial rollers. A solid cylinder executing this motion combines translational movement of its center of mass with rotation about its axis. The total kinetic energy arises from both components, governed by fundamental physical laws.

##### Problem Statement  
A solid cylinder of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolls without slipping on a horizontal surface. Its total kinetic energy is $K$. Derive an expression for the linear speed $v$ of the cylinder's center of mass. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $K$ and $M$ only.

### Solution
**Step 1: Identify kinetic energy components**  
The total kinetic energy $K$ is the sum of translational and rotational components:  
$$ K = K_{\text{trans}} + K_{\text{rot}} $$  
where:  
- Translational kinetic energy: $ K_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 $  
- Rotational kinetic energy: $ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 $  

**Step 2: Apply moment of inertia**  
For a solid cylinder about its central axis:  
$$ I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 $$  

**Step 3: Enforce rolling-without-slipping condition**  
The linear and angular velocities are related by:  
$$ v = R \omega \quad \Rightarrow \quad \omega = \frac{v}{R} $$  

**Step 4: Substitute into rotational kinetic energy**  
$$ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} M v^2 = \frac{1}{4} M v^2 $$  

**Step 5: Combine energy terms**  
$$ K = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 + \frac{1}{4} M v^2 = \left( \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \right) M v^2 = \frac{3}{4} M v^2 $$  

**Step 6: Solve for linear speed $v$**  
$$ K = \frac{3}{4} M v^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{4K}{3M} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = \sqrt{ \frac{4K}{3M} } $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{4K}{3M}}}$$

##### Problem Statement
Derive the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the pulley immediately after release. Express $\alpha$ symbolically in terms of $m_1$, $m_2$, $\mu$, $I$, $R$, and $g$.  

**Final Answer Format Requirements**

- Format fractions using `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`  
- Example of valid form: $\frac{g(m_2 - \mu m_1)R}{I + R^2(m_1 + m_2)}$

### Solution
**Step 1: Define variables and constraints**  
Let:  
- $T_1$ = tension in string connected to $m_1$  
- $T_2$ = tension in string connected to $m_2$  
- $a$ = linear acceleration magnitude of both blocks (since string is inextensible)  
- $\alpha$ = angular acceleration of pulley  
Constraint (no slip): $a = R \alpha$  

**Step 2: Equation for $m_1$ (horizontal motion)**  
Forces in vertical direction: $N = m_1 g$ (no vertical acceleration)  
Kinetic friction: $f_k = \mu N = \mu m_1 g$  
Newton's second law (horizontal, positive direction right):  
$$ T_1 - f_k = m_1 a $$  
$$ T_1 - \mu m_1 g = m_1 a \quad (1) $$  

**Step 3: Equation for $m_2$ (vertical motion)**  
Newton's second law (positive direction downward):  
$$ m_2 g - T_2 = m_2 a \quad (2) $$  

**Step 4: Equation for pulley (rotational motion)**  
Net torque about axle: $\tau = (T_2 - T_1)R$ (tensions create opposing torques)  
Newton's second law for rotation: $\tau = I \alpha$  
$$ (T_2 - T_1)R = I \alpha \quad (3) $$  

**Step 5: Relate linear and angular acceleration**  
$$ \alpha = \frac{a}{R} \quad (4) $$  

**Step 6: Solve the system**  
Substitute (4) into (3):  
$$ (T_2 - T_1)R = I \frac{a}{R} $$  
$$ T_2 - T_1 = \frac{I a}{R^2} \quad (3a) $$  
Rearrange (1) and (2):  
$$ T_1 = m_1 a + \mu m_1 g \quad (1a) $$  
$$ T_2 = m_2 g - m_2 a \quad (2a) $$  
Substitute (1a) and (2a) into (3a):  
$$ (m_2 g - m_2 a) - (m_1 a + \mu m_1 g) = \frac{I a}{R^2} $$  
$$ m_2 g - \mu m_1 g - m_2 a - m_1 a = \frac{I a}{R^2} $$  
$$ g(m_2 - \mu m_1) = a \left( m_1 + m_2 + \frac{I}{R^2} \right) $$  
Solve for $a$:  
$$ a = \frac{g(m_2 - \mu m_1)}{m_1 + m_2 + \frac{I}{R^2}} $$  
Substitute into (4):  
$$ \alpha = \frac{a}{R} = \frac{g(m_2 - \mu m_1)}{R \left( m_1 + m_2 + \frac{I}{R^2} \right)} $$  
Simplify denominator:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{g(m_2 - \mu m_1)}{R(m_1 + m_2) + \frac{I}{R}} $$  
Multiply numerator and denominator by $R$:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{g R (m_2 - \mu m_1)}{R^2 (m_1 + m_2) + I} $$  
Final form:  
$$ \alpha = \frac{g R (m_2 - \mu m_1)}{I + R^2 (m_1 + m_2)} $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \frac{ g R (m_2 - \mu m_1) }{ I + R^2 (m_1 + m_2) } }$$

Used in designing inertial dampers for earthquake-resistant structures, roller coaster energy dissipation systems, and industrial conveyor mechanisms with curved sections.

##### Problem Statement
Derive the speed $v$ of the ball's center of mass when it reaches the bottom of the track. Express $v$ symbolically in terms of $g$ (gravitational acceleration) and $R_{\text{track}}$, using the condition $R_{\text{track}} \gg R$ to simplify your expression. Justify all approximations.

### Solution
**Step 1: Energy Conservation Setup**  
Initial mechanical energy (top of track) is purely gravitational potential energy. The center of mass drops by a height $h$. Given $R_{\text{track}} \gg R$, the center-of-mass path radius ≈ $R_{\text{track}}$. For a quarter-circle, the vertical drop is $h = R_{\text{track}}$. Thus:  
$$E_{\text{initial}} = Mgh = MgR_{\text{track}}$$  
Final mechanical energy (bottom) is kinetic only, with translational and rotational components:  
$$E_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}I_{\text{cm}}\omega^2$$  

**Step 2: Rolling-Without-Slipping Condition**  
Angular speed $\omega$ relates to linear speed $v$ by:  
$$\omega = \frac{v}{R}$$  

**Step 3: Moment of Inertia for Solid Sphere**  
$$I_{\text{cm}} = \frac{2}{5}MR^2$$  

**Step 4: Substitute into Kinetic Energy**  
$$\begin{aligned}  
E_{\text{final}} &= \frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{5}MR^2\right)\left(\frac{v}{R}\right)^2 \\  
&= \frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5}Mv^2 \\  
&= \frac{1}{2}Mv^2 + \frac{1}{5}Mv^2 \\  
&= \frac{5}{10}Mv^2 + \frac{2}{10}Mv^2 \\  
&= \frac{7}{10}Mv^2  
\end{aligned}$$  

**Step 5: Apply Energy Conservation**  
$$E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}$$  
$$MgR_{\text{track}} = \frac{7}{10}Mv^2$$  

**Step 6: Solve for $v$**  
$$\begin{aligned}  
gR_{\text{track}} &= \frac{7}{10}v^2 \\  
v^2 &= \frac{10}{7}gR_{\text{track}} \\  
v &= \sqrt{\frac{10}{7}gR_{\text{track}}}  
\end{aligned}$$  

**Justification of Approximation:**  
The exact center-of-mass drop is $R_{\text{track}} - R$ (since the COM orbits at radius $R_{\text{track}} - R$). However, $R_{\text{track}} \gg R$ implies $R_{\text{track}} - R \approx R_{\text{track}}$, making the approximation valid.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{10gR_{\text{track}}}{7}}}$$

### Problem 37
##### Background
A merry-go-round in a playground rotates freely with negligible friction about a fixed vertical axis. The merry-go-round itself has a moment of inertia $I_0$ about its rotation axis when no additional masses are present at the edge. Initially, a child of mass $m$ sits at the exact center of the merry-go-round, and the system rotates with an initial angular velocity $\omega_0$. As the child moves slowly outward to a distance $r$ from the center, the rotational dynamics change due to conservation principles.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conservation of angular momentum in isolated systems.  
2. Moment of inertia calculations, including contributions from point masses.  
3. Relationship between angular velocity and moment of inertia under torque-free conditions.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to rotational kinetic energy $\left(\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2\right)$ and the parallel axis theorem, which generalizes moment of inertia for shifted positions. It also reinforces core principles of rotational dynamics, such as $\tau = I\alpha$.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The conservation of angular momentum applies to diverse fields:  
- **Astronomy**: Explains phenomena like neutron star formation, where radial collapse increases rotation speed.  
- **Engineering**: Critical in designing flywheels and gyroscopes for energy storage and stabilization.  
- **Sports**: Models figure skaters pulling in their arms to spin faster during jumps.  

##### Real-World Applications
- **Amusement park rides**: Rotating platforms where rider movement affects rotational speed.  
- **Spacecraft attitude control**: Astronauts moving radially in rotating habitats alter spin rates without thrusters.  
- **Industrial mixers**: Changes in ingredient distribution impact rotational inertia and mixing efficiency.  

##### Problem Statement
The child moves radially outward from the center to a fixed distance $r$ from the rotation axis. During this movement, no external torques act on the system. Derive an expression for the new angular velocity $\omega_f$ after the child reaches $r$. Express $\omega_f$ solely in terms of the given quantities: $m$, $r$, $I_0$, and $\omega_0$.  
**Note**: $I_0$ represents the moment of inertia of the merry-go-round alone (without the child at the edge). The child's initial position at the center contributes negligibly to the moment of inertia.

### Solution
The system is isolated with no external torques, so angular momentum is conserved. The initial angular momentum $L_i$ equals the final angular momentum $L_f$.  

**Step 1: Initial angular momentum**  
Initially, the child is at the center ($r=0$), so their moment of inertia is negligible. The total initial moment of inertia is $I_0$. The initial angular momentum is:  
$$ L_i = I_0 \omega_0 $$  

**Step 2: Final angular momentum**  
After moving to distance $r$, the child contributes $m r^2$ to the moment of inertia. The merry-go-round's moment of inertia remains $I_0$, so the total final moment of inertia is $I_0 + m r^2$. The final angular momentum is:  
$$ L_f = (I_0 + m r^2) \omega_f $$  

**Step 3: Apply conservation of angular momentum**  
Set $L_i = L_f$:  
$$ I_0 \omega_0 = (I_0 + m r^2) \omega_f $$  

**Step 4: Solve for $\omega_f$**  
Isolate $\omega_f$:  
$$ \omega_f = \frac{I_0 \omega_0}{I_0 + m r^2} $$  
This is the new angular velocity.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{I_{0} \omega_{0}}{I_{0} + m r^{2}}}$$

### Problem 4
##### Background
A solid cylinder is a common object in rotational dynamics, often used in real-world applications such as wheels, rollers, and mechanical components. When a cylinder rolls without slipping, its motion involves both translation (movement of the center of mass) and rotation about its central axis. The total kinetic energy of such an object combines these two aspects, providing insight into energy distribution in rolling systems.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Rotational kinetic energy: $ KE_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 $, where $ I $ is the moment of inertia and $ \omega $ is the angular velocity.
2. Translational kinetic energy: $ KE_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 $, where $ M $ is mass and $ v $ is linear velocity.
3. Rolling without slipping condition: $ v = R \omega $, linking linear and angular motion.
4. Moment of inertia for a solid cylinder about its central axis: $ I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 $.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to torque, angular acceleration, and conservation of mechanical energy in systems involving rotational motion. It also reinforces the relationship between linear and angular variables in rigid body dynamics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The principles apply to mechanical engineering (e.g., designing efficient rolling mechanisms), automotive engineering (wheel dynamics), and physics (analyzing celestial bodies with rotational motion).

##### Real-World Applications
- **Transportation**: Calculating the kinetic energy of rolling wheels in vehicles helps optimize fuel efficiency and braking systems.
- **Industrial machinery**: Understanding energy distribution in rotating drums or rollers aids in designing conveyor systems.
- **Sports science**: Analyzing the motion of cylindrical objects like bowling balls or curling stones.

##### Problem Statement
A solid cylinder of mass $ M $ and radius $ R $ rolls without slipping on a horizontal surface with a linear speed $ v $. Derive an expression for the total kinetic energy of the cylinder in terms of $ M $ and $ v $ only. Show that the radius $ R $ does not appear in the final expression.

### Solution
The total kinetic energy $ KE_{\text{total}} $ is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic energy:  
$$ KE_{\text{total}} = KE_{\text{trans}} + KE_{\text{rot}} $$  

The translational kinetic energy is:  
$$ KE_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 $$  

The rotational kinetic energy is:  
$$ KE_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 $$  
where $ I $ is the moment of inertia. For a solid cylinder about its central axis:  
$$ I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 $$  

Due to rolling without slipping, the linear speed $ v $ and angular speed $ \omega $ are related by:  
$$ v = R \omega \quad \Rightarrow \quad \omega = \frac{v}{R} $$  

Substitute $ I $ and $ \omega $ into the rotational kinetic energy equation:  
$$ KE_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \left( \frac{v}{R} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \cdot \frac{v^2}{R^2} = \frac{1}{4} M v^2 $$  

Combine translational and rotational components:  
$$ KE_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} M v^2 + \frac{1}{4} M v^2 = \frac{3}{4} M v^2 $$  

The radius $ R $ cancels out, leaving the total kinetic energy solely in terms of $ M $ and $ v $.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{3}{4} M v^{2}}$$

### Problem 5
##### Background
Flywheels are mechanical devices used to store rotational energy in applications ranging from industrial machinery to energy storage systems. In this scenario, a solid disk flywheel is spinning at a high angular velocity. To ensure safe operation, a braking system must be designed to stop the flywheel within a specified time by applying constant torque. The braking torque opposes the rotation, causing angular deceleration. Understanding the relationship between the flywheel's physical properties, initial motion, stopping time, and required torque is essential for engineering such systems.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Moment of inertia for a solid disk rotating about its central axis.
2. Newton's second law for rotation: torque as the product of moment of inertia and angular acceleration.
3. Kinematics of rotational motion under constant angular acceleration.
4. Derivation of physical quantities through symbolic manipulation.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- **Rotational Kinetic Energy**: The work done by the braking torque equals the change in rotational kinetic energy, providing an alternative solution path via energy methods.
- **Frictional Dynamics**: Although not explicitly used here, the braking torque originates from friction in real systems, connecting to friction models and heat dissipation.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Design of braking systems for vehicles, machinery, and energy-storage flywheels requires precise torque calculations to ensure safety and efficiency.
- **Energy Management**: Flywheels store kinetic energy; controlled deceleration is crucial in applications like regenerative braking and grid-stabilization systems.

##### Real-World Applications
- **Automotive Brakes**: Disk brakes in cars and motorcycles use similar principles, where hydraulic pressure applies friction pads to a rotor (disk) to generate stopping torque.
- **Industrial Equipment**: Conveyor belts, centrifuges, and turbines use flywheel braking for emergency stops or speed regulation.
- **Renewable Energy**: Flywheel energy storage systems in wind/solar installations require controlled braking to manage power output during grid fluctuations.

##### Problem Statement
A solid disk flywheel of mass $ M $ and radius $ R $ is rotating about its central axis with an initial angular velocity $ \omega_i $. A constant braking torque $ \tau $ is applied to bring the flywheel to a complete stop in time $ t $. Derive an expression for the required braking torque $ \tau $ in terms of $ M $, $ R $, $ \omega_i $, and $ t $. Ensure your derivation starts from fundamental principles and clearly justifies each step.

### Solution
**Step 1: Determine the moment of inertia of the solid disk**  
The moment of inertia $ I $ for a solid disk rotating about its central axis is derived from its mass distribution. For a solid disk of mass $ M $ and radius $ R $:  
$$ I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 $$  
This result is standard for axisymmetric objects with uniform density.

**Step 2: Relate torque to angular acceleration using Newton's second law for rotation**  
The braking torque $ \tau $ causes an angular acceleration $ \alpha $ (which is negative for deceleration). Newton's second law for rotation states:  
$$ \tau = I \alpha $$  
Since the torque is constant, $ \alpha $ is constant.

**Step 3: Apply rotational kinematics to link angular acceleration, initial velocity, and time**  
The rotational kinematic equation under constant angular acceleration is:  
$$ \omega_f = \omega_i + \alpha t $$  
where $ \omega_f $ is the final angular velocity. The flywheel stops completely, so $ \omega_f = 0 $:  
$$ 0 = \omega_i + \alpha t $$  
Solving for $ \alpha $:  
$$ \alpha = -\frac{\omega_i}{t} $$  
The negative sign confirms deceleration.

**Step 4: Substitute into the torque equation**  
Substitute $ \alpha $ from Step 3 and $ I $ from Step 1 into the torque equation:  
$$ \tau = \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \left( -\frac{\omega_i}{t} \right) $$  
The magnitude of torque is required, so we take the absolute value (the negative sign indicates direction, not magnitude):  
$$ \tau = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \cdot \frac{\omega_i}{t} $$  

**Step 5: Simplify the expression**  
Combine terms to write the final expression for torque:  
$$ \tau = \frac{M R^2 \omega_i}{2 t} $$  
This is the required braking torque.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{M R^{2} \omega_i}{2 t}}$$

### Problem 6
##### Background
A merry-go-round is a common playground ride that rotates about a central axis. When a person jumps onto it, the system's rotation changes due to conservation of angular momentum. This principle is vital in designing rotating systems like centrifuges, flywheels, and spacecraft attitude control mechanisms. In this scenario, a child jumps onto a stationary merry-go-round while running tangent to its edge.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Conservation of angular momentum.
- Moment of inertia for composite systems.
- Relationship between linear and angular quantities.
- Vector cross products for angular momentum calculation.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects rotational dynamics with translational motion through the child's linear velocity. It also reinforces energy concepts, as kinetic energy is not conserved (inelastic interaction), highlighting differences between conserved quantities in isolated systems.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
In aerospace engineering, angular momentum conservation governs satellite docking and reaction wheel operation. Biomechanically, it relates to how gymnasts control spins by altering their moment of inertia. Geophysics applications include tidal locking between celestial bodies.

##### Real-World Applications

- **Robotics**: Robotic arms and rotating joints require precise angular momentum control.
- **Sports Physics**: Figure skaters and divers adjust rotational speed by changing body configuration mid-spin.

##### Problem Statement
A child of mass $ m $ runs with a tangential speed $ v $ and jumps onto the edge of a stationary merry-go-round. The merry-go-round has a moment of inertia $ I_0 $ about its central axis and a radius $ r $. Assume the child is a point mass, the merry-go-round rotates without friction, and the child adheres instantly to the edge. Derive an expression for the final angular velocity $ \omega $ of the system (merry-go-round with child) in terms of the given symbols: $ m $, $ v $, $ I_0 $, and $ r $.

### Solution
**Step 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum**  
Since no external torques act about the central axis, angular momentum is conserved. The initial angular momentum $ L_i $ (before the jump) equals the final angular momentum $ L_f $ (after the jump).  

**Step 2: Initial Angular Momentum**  
- The merry-go-round is stationary: contributes $ 0 $ angular momentum.  
- The child has linear momentum $ \vec{p} = m \vec{v} $. Positioned at the edge, the radius vector $ \vec{r} $ is perpendicular to $ \vec{v} $. Thus, the child's angular momentum about the center is:  
  $$ L_{\text{child}} = |\vec{r} \times \vec{p}| = r \cdot (m v) \cdot \sin 90^\circ = m v r $$  
- Total initial angular momentum:  
  $$ L_i = m v r $$  

**Step 3: Final Angular Momentum**  
After the jump, the system rotates with angular velocity $ \omega $. The total moment of inertia $ I_{\text{total}} $ is:  
- Merry-go-round: $ I_0 $  
- Child (point mass at distance $ r $): $ m r^2 $  
$$ I_{\text{total}} = I_0 + m r^2 $$  
Final angular momentum:  
$$ L_f = I_{\text{total}} \omega = (I_0 + m r^2) \omega $$  

**Step 4: Equate and Solve for $ \omega $**  
By conservation:  
$$ L_i = L_f $$  
$$ m v r = (I_0 + m r^2) \omega $$  
Solving for $ \omega $:  
$$ \omega = \frac{m v r}{I_0 + m r^2} $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{m v r}{I_0 + m r^2}}$$

### Problem 7
##### Background
In the study of rotational motion, objects rolling down inclines demonstrate how mass distribution affects motion. A common comparison involves a thin-walled hollow cylinder (hoop) and a solid sphere of identical mass and radius, released from rest on identical inclines. Understanding the descent times reveals fundamental principles of rotational inertia and energy conservation.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Rotational kinetic energy**: $ K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 $
2. **Conservation of mechanical energy**: Total energy $ E = mgh + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 $ is conserved.
3. **Rolling without slipping**: Constraint $ v = r\omega $.
4. **Moment of inertia**: For a hoop $ I_h = mr^2 $; for a solid sphere $ I_s = \frac{2}{5}mr^2 $.
5. **Kinematics of linear motion**: $ s = \frac{1}{2}at^2 $ for constant acceleration from rest.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to linear kinematics (acceleration, displacement-time relations).
- Relates to torque and angular acceleration $ \tau = I\alpha $.
- Integrates work-energy theorem with rotational dynamics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Design of wheels and rolling mechanisms (e.g., choosing between solid vs. hollow tires for specific terrain).
- **Sports Science**: Analysis of ball dynamics (e.g., comparing bowling balls vs. basketballs on slopes).

##### Real-World Applications
- **Transportation**: Optimizing wheel designs for vehicles to minimize descent time on inclines.
- **Manufacturing**: Selecting materials and shapes for rollers in conveyor systems to improve efficiency.
- **Safety Systems**: Designing escape ramps with optimal rolling objects for emergency scenarios.

##### Problem Statement
A thin-walled hollow cylinder (hoop) and a solid sphere, each of mass $ m $ and radius $ r $, are released simultaneously from rest at the top of two identical inclines of height $ h $ and angle $ \theta $ to the horizontal. Both objects roll without slipping. The moment of inertia of the hoop about its central axis is $ I_h = m r^2 $, and that of the solid sphere is $ I_s = \frac{2}{5} m r^2 $.  

Derive the ratio of the time taken by the hoop to reach the bottom of the incline to the time taken by the solid sphere. Express your answer as a simplified analytic expression in the form $ \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are coprime integers.

### Solution
**Step 1: General equation for linear acceleration**  
For any object rolling down an incline, the acceleration $ a $ along the incline is derived from forces and torque. The gravitational force component is $ mg\sin\theta $, friction is $ f $, and the no-slip condition gives $ \alpha = a / r $.  
- Newton's second law (linear):  
  $$ mg\sin\theta - f = ma $$
- Torque equation ($ \tau = I\alpha $):  
  $$ f \cdot r = I \alpha = I \frac{a}{r} \implies f = \frac{I a}{r^2} $$
- Substitute $ f $ into the force equation:  
  $$ mg\sin\theta - \frac{I a}{r^2} = ma $$
  $$ mg\sin\theta = a \left( m + \frac{I}{r^2} \right) $$
  $$ a = \frac{g \sin\theta}{1 + \frac{I}{m r^2}} $$

**Step 2: Time of descent using kinematics**  
The distance along the incline $ s $ relates to height $ h $ and angle $ \theta $ by $ s = \frac{h}{\sin\theta} $. For constant acceleration from rest:  
$$ s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \implies t^2 = \frac{2s}{a} = \frac{2h}{a \sin\theta} $$
Substitute $ a $:  
$$ t^2 = \frac{2h}{\sin\theta} \cdot \frac{1 + \frac{I}{m r^2}}{g \sin\theta} = \frac{2h \left(1 + \frac{I}{m r^2}\right)}{g \sin^2 \theta} $$
$$ t = \sqrt{ \frac{2h \left(1 + \frac{I}{m r^2}\right)}{g \sin^2 \theta} } $$

**Step 3: Apply to hoop and sphere**  
- **Hoop**: $ I_h = m r^2 $, so $ 1 + \frac{I_h}{m r^2} = 1 + 1 = 2 $.  
  $$ t_h = \sqrt{ \frac{2h \cdot 2}{g \sin^2 \theta} } = \sqrt{ \frac{4h}{g \sin^2 \theta} } $$
- **Sphere**: $ I_s = \frac{2}{5} m r^2 $, so $ 1 + \frac{I_s}{m r^2} = 1 + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{7}{5} $.  
  $$ t_s = \sqrt{ \frac{2h \cdot \frac{7}{5}}{g \sin^2 \theta} } = \sqrt{ \frac{14h}{5g \sin^2 \theta} } $$

**Step 4: Compute the ratio $ \frac{t_h}{t_s} $**  
$$ \frac{t_h}{t_s} = \frac{ \sqrt{ \dfrac{4h}{g \sin^2 \theta} } }{ \sqrt{ \dfrac{14h}{5g \sin^2 \theta} } } = \sqrt{ \frac{4h}{g \sin^2 \theta} \cdot \frac{5g \sin^2 \theta}{14h} } = \sqrt{ \frac{4 \cdot 5}{14} } = \sqrt{ \frac{20}{14} } = \sqrt{ \frac{10}{7} } $$

**Conclusion**  
The ratio of descent times is $ \sqrt{\dfrac{10}{7}} $, where 10 and 7 are coprime.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{10}{7}}}$$

### Problem 8
##### Background
Rotating systems often encounter sudden changes due to impacts or added masses, such as debris colliding with a satellite or an object sticking to a rotating fan blade. These events can alter the rotational motion significantly. Consider a uniform rod of length $L$ and mass $M$ that rotates freely about a frictionless axle through its center with an initial angular velocity $\omega_i$. A small clay blob of mass $m$, initially stationary relative to the laboratory frame, is positioned such that one end of the rotating rod collides with and adheres to it. This inelastic collision occurs in a horizontal plane, eliminating gravitational effects. 

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Conservation of angular momentum in isolated systems.
- Moment of inertia calculations for continuous bodies (rod) and point masses.
- Inelastic collisions in rotational dynamics.
- Dependence of angular velocity on mass distribution.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to torque, rotational work, and energy (though energy is not conserved here due to inelasticity).
- Relates to linear momentum conservation by analogy, highlighting differences in rotational systems.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Aerospace Engineering**: Simulates space debris altering satellite rotation.
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Models impacts on rotating machinery components.
- **Sports Science**: Analogous to a gymnast adjusting body configuration during a spin.

##### Real-World Applications
- **Satellite Attitude Control**: Unplanned mass additions (e.g., micrometeoroid impacts) can destabilize orientation, requiring corrective thrusters.
- **Industrial Safety**: Foreign objects striking rotating equipment (e.g., turbines) change dynamics, potentially causing failures.
- **Physics Demonstrations**: Common classroom experiments with rotating platforms and added weights.

##### Problem Statement
Using conservation of angular momentum, derive an expression for the final angular velocity $\omega_f$ of the rod-clay system immediately after the clay adheres to the rod's end. Express $\omega_f$ in terms of the given symbolic parameters: $M$, $m$, $L$, and $\omega_i$.  

**Answer Format Requirements**:  
- The answer must be a single, simplified analytic expression.  
- Use fractions (e.g., $\frac{3}{4}$) instead of decimals.  
- Explicitly include all parameters in the expression: $M$, $m$, $L$, $\omega_i$.

### Solution
**Step 1: State angular momentum conservation**  
Since no external torques act about the center axle (axle forces exert zero torque at pivot), angular momentum is conserved:  

$$
L_{\text{initial}} = L_{\text{final}}
$$


**Step 2: Calculate initial angular momentum**  
The rod's initial moment of inertia about its center is $\frac{1}{12}ML^2$. The clay is stationary, so its initial angular momentum is zero. Thus:  

$$
L_{\text{initial}} = I_{\text{rod}} \omega_i = \left(\frac{1}{12}ML^2\right) \omega_i
$$


**Step 3: Calculate final moment of inertia**  
After adhesion, the clay (point mass) is at distance $r = L/2$ from the center. The rod's moment of inertia remains $\frac{1}{12}ML^2$, while the clay contributes $m(L/2)^2$:  

$$
I_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{12}ML^2 + m\left(\frac{L}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{12}ML^2 + \frac{1}{4}mL^2
$$


**Step 4: Apply conservation law**  
Let $\omega_f$ be the final angular velocity. Then:  

$$
L_{\text{final}} = I_{\text{final}}  \omega_f = \left( \frac{1}{12}ML^2 + \frac{1}{4}mL^2 \right) \omega_f
$$
  
Equating initial and final angular momentum:  

$$
\frac{1}{12}ML^2 \omega_i = \left( \frac{1}{12}ML^2 + \frac{1}{4}mL^2 \right) \omega_f
$$


**Step 5: Solve for $\omega_f$**  
Factor $L^2$ (assuming $L \neq 0$) and rearrange:  

$$
\frac{1}{12}M \omega_i = \left( \frac{1}{12}M + \frac{1}{4}m \right) \omega_f
$$
  
Multiply both sides by 12:  

$$
M \omega_i = \left( M + 3m \right) \omega_f
$$
  
Solve for $\omega_f$:  

$$
\omega_f = \frac{M \omega_i}{M + 3m}
$$
  
The $L^2$ terms cancel, so the length $L$ does not appear in the final expression.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{M \omega_i}{M + 3m}}$$

------
### Problem 9
##### Background
In a traditional well system, a bucket is lowered by unwinding a rope from a cylindrical drum mounted on a frictionless axle. This setup is used to study the interplay between linear and rotational motion. The drum is a solid, uniform cylinder that rotates freely, and the rope unwinds without slipping. Understanding the forces involved is essential for designing safe lifting mechanisms, as excessive tension can cause rope failure.

The scenario models engineering applications like elevator pulleys, crane winches, and fishing reels. Material science principles are relevant for determining rope strength limits, while kinematics links acceleration profiles to safety margins in mechanical design.

##### Real-World Applications
Calculating tension is critical in designing hoisting systems for construction cranes, mine elevators, and sailboat rigging. Excessive tension causes wear or catastrophic failure; this analysis helps select appropriate rope materials and drum dimensions to maintain safety factors.

##### Problem Statement
A bucket of mass $m$ is attached to a rope wound around a solid cylindrical drum of mass $M$ and radius $R$. The drum rotates about a fixed frictionless axle. When released from rest, the bucket accelerates vertically downward with constant magnitude $a$. Derive an expression for the tension $T$ in the rope during this acceleration. Use the parameters $m$, $M$, $R$, $a$, and gravitational acceleration $g$ as needed. Note that some parameters may not appear in the final expression.  

*Express your answer as a simplified analytic expression. Use only the symbols provided in the problem statement.*

### Solution
**Step 1: Analyze forces on the bucket**  
The bucket experiences downward gravitational force $mg$ and upward tension $T$. By Newton's second law:  

$$
mg - T = ma \quad \text{(1)}
$$


**Step 2: Analyze torque on the drum**  
The tension exerts torque $\tau = TR$ on the drum. For a solid cylinder about its central axis, the moment of inertia is $I = \frac{1}{2}MR^2$. The rotational analog of Newton's second law gives:  

$$
\tau = I\alpha \implies TR = \left(\frac{1}{2}MR^2\right) \alpha \quad \text{(2)}
$$


**Step 3: Relate linear and angular acceleration**  
The rope unwinds without slipping, so linear acceleration $a$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$ are related by:  

$$
a = R\alpha \quad \text{or} \quad \alpha = \frac{a}{R} \quad \text{(3)}
$$


**Step 4: Solve for tension**  
Substitute equation (3) into equation (2):  

$$
TR = \frac{1}{2}MR^2 \cdot \frac{a}{R} = \frac{1}{2}MRa
$$
  
Divide both sides by $R$:  

$$
T = \frac{1}{2}Ma \quad \text{(4)}
$$


**Verification with energy (optional insight)**  
The work-energy theorem confirms consistency. The loss in gravitational potential energy equals the sum of translational and rotational kinetic energies:  

$$
mg \Delta h = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2
$$
  
Substituting $v = R\omega$ and $I = \frac{1}{2}MR^2$:  

$$
mg \Delta h = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}MR^2\right)\left(\frac{v^2}{R^2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}v^2 \left(m + \frac{M}{2}\right)
$$
  
Differentiating with respect to time yields $a = \frac{mg}{m + M/2}$, consistent with equation (1) and (4).

**Conclusion**  
The tension is independent of $g$, $m$, and $R$, depending only on the drum's mass and the bucket's acceleration.

### Problem 0
##### Background

- Principle of superposition for forces
- Vector addition in one dimension
- Directional dependence of electrostatic forces

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Engineering**: Stability analysis of charged particles in particle accelerators
- **Materials Science**: Forces in ionic crystal lattices with linear defects

##### Real-World Applications
Determining forces on ions in mass spectrometry filters, analyzing stress points in piezoelectric materials, and designing linear ion traps for quantum computing.

##### Problem Statement
Three point charges lie on a straight line in vacuum. Charge $A$ ($q_A$) is positioned at the origin. Charge $B$ ($q_B$) is located at a distance $d$ to the right of $A$. Charge $C$ ($q_C$) is located at a distance $2d$ to the right of $B$. All charges are fixed in position. Derive the net electrostatic force acting on charge $B$.  

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $q_A$, $q_B$, $q_C$, $d$, and the electrostatic constant $k$ (where $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$). Adhere to the following conventions:  
- Rightward force is positive  
- Use exact fractions (e.g., $\frac{1}{4}$)  
- Denote powers as $d^2$ (not $d{\wedge}2$)  
- Explicitly write multiplication signs (e.g., $k \cdot q_B$)

### Solution
**Step 1: Force on $B$ due to $A$**  
By Coulomb's law, the magnitude of force between $A$ and $B$ is:  
$$F_{BA} = k \frac{|q_A q_B|}{r_{AB}^2}$$  
where $r_{AB} = d$. The direction depends on charge signs:  
- If $q_A$ and $q_B$ have the same sign, the force is repulsive. Since $A$ is left of $B$, repulsion pushes $B$ rightward ($+$ direction).  
- If $q_A$ and $q_B$ have opposite signs, the force is attractive, pulling $B$ leftward ($-$ direction).  

This directional dependence is captured by:  
$$\vec{F}_{BA} = k \frac{q_A q_B}{d^2} \hat{\imath}$$  
where $\hat{\imath}$ is the unit vector in the positive $x$-direction. The sign of the product $q_A q_B$ determines the direction.

**Step 2: Force on $B$ due to $C$**  
The distance between $B$ and $C$ is $r_{BC} = 2d$. The force magnitude is:  
$$F_{BC} = k \frac{|q_B q_C|}{(2d)^2} = k \frac{|q_B q_C|}{4d^2}$$  
Direction analysis:  
- $C$ is right of $B$. If $q_B$ and $q_C$ have the same sign, repulsion pushes $B$ leftward ($-$ direction).  
- If $q_B$ and $q_C$ have opposite signs, attraction pulls $B$ rightward ($+$ direction).  

The vector form is:  
$$\vec{F}_{BC} = k \frac{q_B q_C}{(2d)^2} (-\hat{\imath}) = -k \frac{q_B q_C}{4d^2} \hat{\imath}$$  
The negative sign accounts for the leftward push when $q_B q_C > 0$.

**Step 3: Net force via superposition**  
The net force on $B$ is the vector sum:  
$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_{BA} + \vec{F}_{BC}$$  
Substituting the expressions:  
$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \left( k \frac{q_A q_B}{d^2} \right) \hat{\imath} + \left( -k \frac{q_B q_C}{4d^2} \right) \hat{\imath}$$  
Factor out $k q_B$ and $\hat{\imath}$:  
$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = k q_B \left( \frac{q_A}{d^2} - \frac{q_C}{4d^2} \right) \hat{\imath}$$  
Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:  
$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = k q_B \left( \frac{4q_A - q_C}{4d^2} \right) \hat{\imath}$$  
The scalar component (as specified in the problem) is:  
$$F_{\text{net}} = k q_B \frac{4q_A - q_C}{4d^2}$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{k \cdot q_B \cdot \frac{4q_A - q_C}{4d^2}}$$

### Problem 1
##### Background
In an experimental setup to study electrostatic forces, four point charges are fixed at the vertices of a square with side length $a$. The charges are arranged such that two adjacent vertices carry positive charge $+q$, while the other two adjacent vertices carry negative charge $-q$. A fifth point charge $Q$ is positioned at the geometric center of the square. This configuration models simplified electrostatic quadrupoles used in particle beam focusing systems and mass spectrometry.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Application of Coulomb's law for point charges.
2. Vector superposition of electrostatic forces.
3. Distance calculations in symmetric geometries.
4. Component-wise vector addition in Cartesian coordinates.
5. Magnitude calculation of resultant force vectors.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem extends to electric field calculations, as the force on $Q$ equals $Q \vec{E}$, where $\vec{E}$ is the net electric field at the center due to the four charges. It also reinforces the principle of superposition, fundamental to electrostatics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The charge arrangement resembles molecular quadrupoles in chemistry and electrostatic lenses in accelerator physics. The solution technique (vector decomposition) applies to gravitational force calculations in celestial mechanics.

##### Real-World Applications
Electrostatic quadrupoles focus charged particle beams in cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, and linear accelerators. Similar principles are used in quadrupole ion traps for precise mass measurements in analytical chemistry.

##### Problem Statement
Consider a square with side length $a$. Charges are fixed at its vertices: $+q$ at $(0,0)$, $+q$ at $(a,0)$, $-q$ at $(a,a)$, and $-q$ at $(0,a)$. A point charge $Q$ is placed at the center $\left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right)$.

Determine the magnitude of the net electrostatic force acting on $Q$. Express your answer symbolically using Coulomb's constant $k$, the charges $q$ and $Q$, and the side length $a$.

**Answer Format Instructions**:
- Provide an exact analytic expression.
- Use $\sqrt{\cdot}$ for square roots and $\frac{}{}$ for fractions.
- Do not substitute numerical values or constants.

### Solution
**Step 1: Distance from center to vertex**  
The distance $r$ from the center $\left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right)$ to any vertex (e.g., $(0,0)$) is:  
$$ r = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{a}{2} - 0 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{a}{2} - 0 \right)^2 } = \sqrt{ \frac{a^2}{4} + \frac{a^2}{4} } = \sqrt{ \frac{a^2}{2} } = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} $$

**Step 2: Force magnitude due to each charge**  
The magnitude of the electrostatic force on $Q$ due to any corner charge $q_i$ is:  
$$ F_i = k \frac{ |q_i| |Q| }{r^2} = k \frac{ q Q }{ \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 } = k \frac{q Q}{ \frac{a^2}{2} } = \frac{2kqQ}{a^2} $$  
This magnitude is identical for all four charges since $|q_i| = q$.

**Step 3: Force vectors**  
Assume $Q > 0$ for direction (magnitude is sign-independent). Define unit vectors based on force directions:  
- **Force from $+q$ at $(0,0)$ (A)**: Repulsive, so direction away from A. Vector from A to center: $\left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right)$. Unit vector: $\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)$.  
  $$\vec{F}_A = \frac{2kqQ}{a^2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^2} (1, 1)$$  
- **Force from $+q$ at $(a,0)$ (B)**: Repulsive. Vector from B to center: $\left( -\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right)$. Unit vector: $\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)$.  
  $$\vec{F}_B = \frac{2kqQ}{a^2} \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^2} (-1, 1)$$  
- **Force from $-q$ at $(a,a)$ (C)**: Attractive, so direction toward C. Vector from center to C: $\left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right)$. Unit vector: $\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)$.  
  $$\vec{F}_C = \frac{2kqQ}{a^2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^2} (1, 1)$$  
- **Force from $-q$ at $(0,a)$ (D)**: Attractive. Vector from center to D: $\left( -\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right)$. Unit vector: $\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)$.  
  $$\vec{F}_D = \frac{2kqQ}{a^2} \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^2} (-1, 1)$$  

**Step 4: Vector sum**  
Sum x-components:  
$$ F_x = \frac{\sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^2} \left[ 1 \, (\text{A}) + (-1) \, (\text{B}) + 1 \, (\text{C}) + (-1) \, (\text{D}) \right] = 0 $$  
Sum y-components:  
$$ F_y = \frac{\sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^2} \left[ 1 \, (\text{A}) + 1 \, (\text{B}) + 1 \, (\text{C}) + 1 \, (\text{D}) \right] = \frac{\sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^2} \times 4 = \frac{4 \sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^2} $$  

**Step 5: Magnitude of net force**  
Since $F_x = 0$, the net force magnitude is $|F_y|$:  
$$ |\vec{F}_{\text{net}}| = \left| \frac{4 \sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^2} \right| = \frac{4 \sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^2} $$  
(The expression is positive as it represents magnitude.)

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{4 \sqrt{2} k q Q}{a^{2}}}$$

### Problem 10
##### Background
In experimental physics, the superposition principle for electrostatic forces is fundamental for analyzing systems with multiple charges.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Vector superposition of forces in two dimensions.
3. Trigonometric resolution of vectors in Cartesian coordinates.
4. Geometric properties of equilateral triangles and centroid.

- **Vector Algebra**: Resolving forces into components and summing vectors.
- **Electrostatics**: Applying Coulomb's law with varying charge signs and magnitudes.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications

- **Electrostatic Levitators**: Devices that suspend objects using balanced electrostatic forces, applied in material science research.

##### Problem Statement
Three point charges are fixed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The distance from the geometric center of the triangle to any vertex is $R$. The charges are:
- Vertex A: $+Q$
- Vertex B: $-Q$
- Vertex C: $+Q$

A test charge $+q$ is placed at the center. Using a coordinate system where the center is at the origin $(0,0)$, vertex C is on the negative $y$-axis at $(0, -R)$, vertex A is at $\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}R, \frac{1}{2}R\right)$, and vertex B is at $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}R, \frac{1}{2}R\right)$, derive the net electrostatic force vector $\vec{F}$ acting on the test charge. Express $\vec{F}$ in terms of Coulomb's constant $k$, $q$, $Q$, $R$, and unit vectors $\hat{\mathbf{i}}$ (x-direction) and $\hat{\mathbf{j}}$ (y-direction). Provide the answer in component form.

### Solution
The net force on the test charge $+q$ is the vector sum of the forces due to each vertex charge. Coulomb's law gives the force magnitude between two charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by distance $r$ as $k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$, with direction along the line joining them. Since the distance from the center to each vertex is $R$, the force magnitudes depend on $R$. The direction depends on the sign of the charges and the position vectors.

**Step 1: Force due to charge at A ($+Q$)**  
Position of A: $\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}R, \frac{1}{2}R\right)$  
Vector from A to center: $\left(0 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}R, 0 - \frac{1}{2}R\right) = \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}R, -\frac{1}{2}R\right)$  
Distance: $R$  
Unit vector from A to center: $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}\right)$  
Since both charges are positive, the force on $+q$ is repulsive and in the direction of the unit vector from A to center:  

$$
\vec{F}_A = k \frac{(q)(Q)}{R^2} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \hat{\mathbf{i}} - \frac{1}{2} \hat{\mathbf{j}}\right) = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \hat{\mathbf{i}} - \frac{1}{2} \hat{\mathbf{j}}\right)
$$


**Step 2: Force due to charge at B ($-Q$)**  
Position of B: $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}R, \frac{1}{2}R\right)$  
Vector from B to center: $\left(0 - \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}R\right), 0 - \frac{1}{2}R\right) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}R, -\frac{1}{2}R\right)$  
Unit vector from B to center: $\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}\right)$  
Charge at B is negative, so the force on $+q$ is attractive (toward B). Thus, the force direction is the same as the unit vector from B to center:  

$$
\vec{F}_B = k \frac{(q)(|-Q|)}{R^2} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \hat{\mathbf{i}} - \frac{1}{2} \hat{\mathbf{j}}\right) = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \hat{\mathbf{i}} - \frac{1}{2} \hat{\mathbf{j}}\right)
$$


**Step 3: Force due to charge at C ($+Q$)**  
Position of C: $(0, -R)$  
Vector from C to center: $(0 - 0, 0 - (-R)) = (0, R)$  
Unit vector from C to center: $(0, 1)$  
Both charges positive, so force on $+q$ is repulsive and in the direction of the unit vector from C to center:  

$$
\vec{F}_C = k \frac{(q)(Q)}{R^2} (0 \hat{\mathbf{i}} + 1 \hat{\mathbf{j}}) = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} (0 \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \hat{\mathbf{j}})
$$


**Step 4: Vector sum of forces**  
Sum the x-components and y-components separately:  

$$
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_A + \vec{F}_B + \vec{F}_C
$$
  
x-component:  

$$
F_x = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \frac{k q Q}{R^2} (0) = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 0
$$
  
y-component:  

$$
F_y = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{k q Q}{R^2} (1) = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + 1\right) = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} ( -1 + 1 ) = 0
$$
  
This yields $\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = 0$, but recheck the directions:

- $\vec{F}_A$: Repulsive from A → downward-left  
- $\vec{F}_B$: Attractive to B → downward-right  
- $\vec{F}_C$: Repulsive from C → upward  

Reevaluate $\vec{F}_C$:  
The unit vector from C to center is $(0, 1)$, so repulsive force on $+q$ is upward, $+ \hat{\mathbf{j}}$.  
For $\vec{F}_B$:  
Attraction toward B means the force direction is along the vector from $+q$ to B. The vector from $+q$ (center) to B is $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}R, \frac{1}{2}R\right)$, so unit vector $\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$. Thus:  

$$
\vec{F}_B = k \frac{(q)(|-Q|)}{R^2} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \frac{1}{2} \hat{\mathbf{j}}\right) = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \frac{1}{2} \hat{\mathbf{j}}\right)
$$
  
Now recalculate the sum:  
x-component:  

$$
F_x = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \frac{k q Q}{R^2} (0) = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\sqrt{3}\right)
$$
  
y-component:  

$$
F_y = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{k q Q}{R^2} (1) = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left(-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + 1\right) = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} (1)
$$
  
Thus:  

$$
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{k q Q}{R^2} \left( -\sqrt{3} \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \hat{\mathbf{j}} \right)
$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{k q Q}{R^{2}} \left( -\sqrt{3}\ \hat{\mathbf{i}} + \hat{\mathbf{j}} \right)}$$

------
### Problem 11
##### Background
In electrostatics, multipole arrangements of charges are crucial for understanding complex electric fields beyond simple monopoles or dipoles. A linear quadrupole is formed by two dipoles arranged antiparallel, creating a configuration with no net charge or dipole moment. Such arrangements are found in devices like quadrupole ion traps used in mass spectrometry and particle accelerators, where precise control of charged particles is essential.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Coulomb's law**: Force between two point charges.
2. **Superposition principle**: Net force on a charge as the vector sum of individual forces.
3. **Vector addition in one dimension**: Handling direction via algebraic signs.
4. **Quadrupole fields**: Characteristic $1/r^4$ force dependence at large distances.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to electric field calculations and multipole expansions in electrostatics.
- Reinforces vector addition skills and symmetry arguments used in dipole and higher-order multipole analyses.
- Provides foundation for understanding electrostatic potential and field gradients.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Chemistry**: Quadrupole mass spectrometers separate ions based on mass-to-charge ratios.
- **Engineering**: Quadrupole fields stabilize particle beams in accelerators (e.g., linear particle colliders).
- **Materials science**: Analyzes charge distributions in molecules and crystals.

##### Real-World Applications
- **Mass spectrometry**: Quadrupole filters selectively allow ions with specific $m/q$ to pass by balancing electrostatic forces.
- **Particle traps**: Confine ions using oscillating quadrupole fields (Paul traps).
- **Molecular physics**: Models interactions in linear symmetric molecules like CO₂.

##### Problem Statement
Consider a linear electric quadrupole composed of three collinear point charges on the $x$-axis:  
- $+Q$ at $x = -d$,  
- $-2Q$ at $x = 0$,  
- $+Q$ at $x = d$.  

A test charge $q$ is placed on the positive $x$-axis at $x = a$, where $a > d$. Derive an expression for the net electrostatic force acting on $q$. Use the Coulomb constant $k$, and express the force in terms of $k$, $Q$, $q$, $d$, and $a$.  

**Answer format requirements**:  
- The force is a scalar representing the $x$-component (positive/negative indicates direction).  
- Write the final expression in analytic form.  
- Use explicit fractions with two-field notation (e.g., $\frac{1}{r^2}$).  
- For inverse trigonometric functions, use $\arcsin$, $\arccos$, etc.  
- For powers, use $x^{n}$ with braces (e.g., $(a-d)^2$).

### Solution
The net force on the test charge $q$ is the vector sum of forces from each quadrupole charge. Since all charges lie on the $x$-axis, the force is purely in the $x$-direction. We compute each force component using Coulomb's law:  
$$ F_i = k \cdot \frac{q \cdot Q_i}{|r_i|^2} \cdot \text{sign}(r_i), $$  
where $r_i = a - x_i$ is the displacement from $Q_i$ to $q$, and $\text{sign}(r_i)$ gives direction ($+1$ for repulsion, $-1$ for attraction).  

**Step 1: Force from charge at $x = -d$ ($+Q$)**  
- Displacement $r_1 = a - (-d) = a + d$.  
- Since $q$ and $Q$ are both positive, the force is repulsive ($+x$ direction).  
- Magnitude:  
$$ F_1 = k \cdot \frac{q \cdot Q}{(a + d)^2}. $$  
- Direction makes $F_1 > 0$.  

**Step 2: Force from charge at $x = 0$ ($-2Q$)**  
- Displacement $r_2 = a - 0 = a$.  
- Opposite signs cause attraction ($-x$ direction).  
- Magnitude:  
$$ F_2 = -k \cdot \frac{q \cdot 2Q}{a^2} = -\frac{2kqQ}{a^2}. $$  

**Step 3: Force from charge at $x = d$ ($+Q$)**  
- Displacement $r_3 = a - d$.  
- Repulsive force ($+x$ direction):  
$$ F_3 = k \cdot \frac{q \cdot Q}{(a - d)^2}. $$  

**Step 4: Net force via superposition**  
Sum the components:  
$$ F_{\text{net}} = F_1 + F_2 + F_3 = kqQ \left[ \frac{1}{(a + d)^2} - \frac{2}{a^2} + \frac{1}{(a - d)^2} \right]. $$  

This expression is valid for $a > d$, ensuring denominators are positive and non-zero.

### Answer
$$ \boxed{ k q Q \left( \frac{1}{(a + d)^2} - \frac{2}{a^2} + \frac{1}{(a - d)^2} \right) } $$

### Problem 12
##### Background
In electrostatic systems, the net force on a charged particle is the vector sum of forces exerted by all other charges. This principle, known as superposition, is fundamental in understanding interactions in atomic physics, molecular bonding, and semiconductor devices.

##### Problem Statement
Three point charges are fixed at the vertices of a right triangle. At the vertex corresponding to the right angle (point O), there is a charge of $-Q$. At the other two vertices (points A and B), there are charges of $+3Q$ and $+4Q$, respectively. The leg adjacent to charge $+3Q$ has length $d$, and the leg adjacent to charge $+4Q$ has length $2d$. The hypotenuse is the line segment connecting $+3Q$ and $+4Q$.  
Determine the **magnitude** of the net electrostatic force acting on the charge $-Q$ at point O. Express your answer symbolically in terms of Coulomb's constant $k$, the fundamental charge magnitude $Q$, and the length $d$. Use exact fractions and radicals where applicable.  
*Instructions for final answer format*:  
- Express all forces using symbolic variables only.  
- Use $\theta$ for angles and specify trigonometric functions explicitly (e.g., $\cos\theta$, not $\cos \theta$).  
- For the net force magnitude, combine terms into a single simplified radical expression.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Define the geometry and force directions
Place point O at the origin (0,0). Let charge $+3Q$ be at point A $(d, 0)$ and charge $+4Q$ at point B $(0, 2d)$. The distance from O to A is $d$, and from O to B is $2d$. The hypotenuse AB has length $\sqrt{d^2 + (2d)^2} = \sqrt{5}d$.

##### Step 2: Calculate individual force magnitudes
The electrostatic force on $-Q$ at O due to $+3Q$ at A is attractive and directed along OA. Its magnitude is:  
$$ F_{OA} = k \frac{|(-Q)(3Q)|}{d^2} = k \frac{3Q^2}{d^2} $$  

The force on $-Q$ at O due to $+4Q$ at B is attractive and directed along OB. Its magnitude is:  
$$ F_{OB} = k \frac{|(-Q)(4Q)|}{(2d)^2} = k \frac{4Q^2}{4d^2} = k \frac{Q^2}{d^2} $$  

##### Step 3: Resolve forces into components
- **Force due to A ($F_{OA}$)**: Along the positive x-axis (from O to A). Thus:  
  $$ F_{OA,x} = F_{OA} = k \frac{3Q^2}{d^2}, \quad F_{OA,y} = 0 $$  
- **Force due to B ($F_{OB}$)**: Along the positive y-axis (from O to B). Thus:  
  $$ F_{OB,x} = 0, \quad F_{OB,y} = F_{OB} = k \frac{Q^2}{d^2} $$  

##### Step 4: Superpose the force components
Net force components on $-Q$:  
$$ F_{\text{net},x} = F_{OA,x} + F_{OB,x} = k \frac{3Q^2}{d^2} + 0 = k \frac{3Q^2}{d^2} $$  
$$ F_{\text{net},y} = F_{OA,y} + F_{OB,y} = 0 + k \frac{Q^2}{d^2} = k \frac{Q^2}{d^2} $$  

##### Step 5: Compute the magnitude of the net force
The magnitude is:  
$$ F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{ F_{\text{net},x}^2 + F_{\text{net},y}^2 } = \sqrt{ \left( k \frac{3Q^2}{d^2} \right)^2 + \left( k \frac{Q^2}{d^2} \right)^2 } $$  
Factor out common terms:  
$$ F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{ k^2 \frac{Q^4}{d^4} (3^2 + 1^2) } = k \frac{Q^2}{d^2} \sqrt{9 + 1} = k \frac{Q^2}{d^2} \sqrt{10} $$

### Answer
$$ \boxed{k \frac{Q^{2}}{d^{2}} \sqrt{10} $$

### Problem 13
##### Background
In an experimental setup, two point charges with unequal magnitudes are fixed along a straight line. A third charge is positioned exactly midway between them. This scenario models real-world systems like electrostatic filters in air purifiers, where charged particles experience forces from multiple electrodes. The Coulomb constant is denoted by $k$.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Coulomb's law for electrostatic force
- Principle of superposition of forces
- Vector addition in one dimension
- Coordinate system application

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
Connects to electric field concepts (force derivation from field strength) and equilibrium analysis (why the midpoint isn't an equilibrium point for asymmetric charges).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Relates to ionic crystal lattices in chemistry (forces on interstitial ions) and electrostatic precipitation in environmental engineering (particle trajectory control).

##### Real-World Applications
Used in designing mass spectrometer ion traps, electrostatic dust removal systems, and scanning probe microscopy where localized charge interactions occur.

##### Problem Statement
Two point charges are fixed on the x-axis: $Q_1 = Q$ at $x = 0$ and $Q_2 = -2Q$ at $x = d$, where $Q > 0$. A third point charge $q > 0$ is placed at the midpoint $(x = d/2)$. Derive the analytic expression for the net electrostatic force's x-component acting on $q$. Use only the parameters $Q$, $q$, $d$, and $k$ in your solution.

### Solution
**Step 1: Establish coordinate system and forces**  
Set reference frame: $Q_1$ at $x=0$, $Q_2$ at $x=d$, $q$ at $x=d/2$.  
Force on $q$ due to $Q_1$:  
- Distance: $r_1 = |d/2 - 0| = d/2$  
- Direction: Both positive ⇒ repulsive ⇒ **+x direction**  
- Magnitude: $F_1 = k \frac{|q Q_1|}{(d/2)^2} = k \frac{q Q}{(d^2/4)} = \frac{4k q Q}{d^2}$  
- **Vector form**: $\vec{F}_1 = +\frac{4k q Q}{d^2} \hat{\imath}$  

Force on $q$ due to $Q_2$:  
- Distance: $r_2 = |d - d/2| = d/2$  
- Direction: $q>0$, $Q_2<0$ ⇒ attractive ⇒ **+x direction** (toward $Q_2$ at right)  
- Magnitude: $F_2 = k \frac{|q (-2Q)|}{(d/2)^2} = k \frac{2q Q}{d^2/4} = \frac{8k q Q}{d^2}$  
- **Vector form**: $\vec{F}_2 = +\frac{8k q Q}{d^2} \hat{\imath}$  

**Step 2: Apply superposition principle**  
Net force x-component:  
$$F_{\text{net},x} = F_{1x} + F_{2x} = \frac{4k q Q}{d^2} + \frac{8k q Q}{d^2} = \frac{12k q Q}{d^2}$$  

**Verification via general formula**:  
General 1D force for charge at midpoint:  
$$F_{\text{net}} = \frac{4k q}{d^2} (Q_1 - Q_2)$$  
Substitute $Q_1 = Q$, $Q_2 = -2Q$:  
$$F_{\text{net}} = \frac{4k q}{d^2} [Q - (-2Q)] = \frac{4k q}{d^2} (3Q) = \frac{12k q Q}{d^2}$$  
Both methods yield identical results.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{12 k q Q}{d^{2}}}$$

### Problem 14
##### Background
In electrostatics, Coulomb's law describes the force between two point charges. When multiple charges are present, the net force on any charge is the vector sum of the forces due to each of the other charges. This problem explores the superposition of forces in a symmetric geometric arrangement. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides of equal length, and its diagonals have unique properties that can simplify force calculations.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Coulomb's law for electrostatic force between point charges.
2. Vector addition and superposition of forces.
3. Symmetry arguments in force resolution.
4. Trigonometric identities and geometric properties of a rhombus.
5. Magnitude calculation of a vector from its components.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- The problem connects to vector algebra in physics, as forces are resolved into components.
- It reinforces the concept of inverse-square laws, central to electrostatics.
- The geometric properties of the rhombus (e.g., diagonals, angles) are applied to simplify the vector sum.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Geometry**: Properties of rhombi, such as diagonals bisecting vertex angles and side-length relations, are used.
- **Trigonometry**: Half-angle identities and dot products are employed to resolve force components.
- **Algebra**: Symbolic manipulation and simplification of expressions are required.

##### Real-World Applications
- Understanding force superposition is crucial in designing electrostatic devices, such as capacitors and sensors.
- Symmetry-based simplifications are used in molecular physics to compute forces in crystal lattices or symmetric molecules.
- The rhombus configuration models real systems like certain crystal structures or engineered materials with periodic symmetry.

##### Problem Statement
Four point charges are fixed at the vertices of a rhombus labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The rhombus has side length $a$ and an acute angle $\theta$ at vertex $A$. The charges are:
- $ +Q $ at vertices $A$ and $C$,
- $ -Q $ at vertices $B$ and $D$.

Find the magnitude of the net electrostatic force on the charge at vertex $A$. Express your answer in terms of $Q$, $a$, $\theta$, and the Coulomb's constant $k$.

### Solution
The net force on the charge at $A$ is found by superposition. The force due to each charge is calculated using Coulomb's law, and vector addition is applied. By symmetry, the net force is along the diagonal $AC$.

**Step 1: Diagonal length $AC$**  
The distance between $A$ and $C$ is found using the law of cosines in triangle $ABC$ (or by vector addition). The diagonal $AC$ is given by:  
$$ AC = |\overrightarrow{AC}| = |\overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{AD}| $$  
Given the angle at $A$ is $\theta$, and $|\overrightarrow{AB}| = |\overrightarrow{AD}| = a$:  
$$ AC = \sqrt{a^2 + a^2 + 2a^2 \cos \theta} = a\sqrt{2(1 + \cos \theta)} $$  
Using the identity $1 + \cos \theta = 2 \cos^2(\theta/2)$:  
$$ AC = a\sqrt{2 \cdot 2 \cos^2(\theta/2)} = 2a \cos(\theta/2) $$  
since $\theta$ is acute, $\cos(\theta/2) > 0$.

**Step 2: Force due to charge at $C$**  
The force on $A$ (charge $+Q$) due to $C$ (charge $+Q$) is repulsive and directed along $AC$ away from $C$. The magnitude is:  
$$ F_{AC} = \frac{k Q^2}{(AC)^2} = \frac{k Q^2}{4a^2 \cos^2(\theta/2)} $$  
The force vector is along the direction from $A$ to $C$.

**Step 3: Forces due to charges at $B$ and $D$**  
The forces on $A$ due to $B$ and $D$ (both charge $-Q$) are attractive. Thus:  
- The force due to $B$ is directed toward $B$, with magnitude $kQ^2 / a^2$.  
- The force due to $D$ is directed toward $D$, with magnitude $kQ^2 / a^2$.  

**Step 4: Resolving forces along diagonal $AC$**  
Define $\phi = \theta/2$. The unit vector along $AC$ is:  
$$ \hat{u}_{AC} = \frac{\overrightarrow{AC}}{|\overrightarrow{AC}|} = \frac{(a(1 + \cos \theta), a \sin \theta)}{2a \cos \phi} = \frac{(2a \cos^2 \phi, 2a \sin \phi \cos \phi)}{2a \cos \phi} = (\cos \phi, \sin \phi) $$  
- **Force due to $B$:** The unit vector from $A$ to $B$ is $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$. The attractive force is toward $B$, so its direction is opposite to this unit vector. The component along $AC$ is:  
  $$ (F_{AB} \cdot \hat{u}_{AC})_{\parallel} = -\frac{k Q^2}{a^2} (\cos \theta \cos \phi + \sin \theta \sin \phi) = -\frac{k Q^2}{a^2} \cos(\theta - \phi) $$  
  Since $\theta = 2\phi$, $\theta - \phi = \phi$:  
  $$ \cos(\theta - \phi) = \cos \phi \implies (F_{AB} \cdot \hat{u}_{AC})_{\parallel} = -\frac{k Q^2}{a^2} \cos \phi $$  
- **Force due to $D$:** The unit vector from $A$ to $D$ is $(1, 0)$. The attractive force is toward $D$, so:  
  $$ (F_{AD} \cdot \hat{u}_{AC})_{\parallel} = -\frac{k Q^2}{a^2} (1 \cdot \cos \phi + 0 \cdot \sin \phi) = -\frac{k Q^2}{a^2} \cos \phi $$  

**Step 5: Net force along $AC$ and magnitude**  
The net force component along $AC$ is the sum:  
$$ F_{\parallel} = F_{AC} + (F_{AB} \cdot \hat{u}_{AC})_{\parallel} + (F_{AD} \cdot \hat{u}_{AC})_{\parallel} = \frac{k Q^2}{4a^2 \cos^2 \phi} - \frac{k Q^2}{a^2} \cos \phi - \frac{k Q^2}{a^2} \cos \phi = \frac{k Q^2}{a^2} \left( \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \phi} - 2 \cos \phi \right) $$  
For acute $\theta$ (so $\phi < 45^\circ$), the expression in parentheses is negative, as $2 \cos \phi > 1/(4 \cos^2 \phi)$ when $\cos \phi > 0.5$ (which holds for $\phi < 60^\circ$, true since $\theta < 90^\circ$). The magnitude is the absolute value:  
$$ |F_{\parallel}| = \frac{k Q^2}{a^2} \left( 2 \cos \phi - \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \phi} \right) $$  
Substituting $\phi = \theta/2$:  
$$ |F_{\text{net}}| = \frac{k Q^2}{a^2} \left( 2 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 (\theta/2)} \right) $$  
Perpendicular components cancel by symmetry, so this is the net force magnitude.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{k Q^{2}}{a^{2}} \left(2 \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - \frac{1}{4 \cos^{2}\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}\right)}$$

------
### Problem 15
##### Background
In electrostatics, the force between point charges is governed by Coulomb's law, which states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The net force on any charge is the vector sum of the individual forces exerted by all other charges, known as the superposition principle. The centroid of a triangle is the point where its three medians intersect and coincides with the center of mass for a uniform triangular lamina. For an isosceles triangle, the centroid lies along the axis of symmetry.

2. Superposition principle for vector addition of forces.
3. Coordinate geometry for determining positions and distances.
4. Properties of centroids in triangles.
5. Symmetry arguments to simplify force components.
6. Algebraic manipulation of vector expressions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects electrostatic force calculations with vector algebra and geometric properties of triangles. It reinforces the concept that symmetry can reduce computational complexity in physics problems, particularly when combining forces from multiple sources.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Mathematics**: Coordinate geometry for centroid location and distance formulas; vector decomposition and trigonometry for force components.
- **Engineering**: Practical applications in electrostatic device design, where symmetric charge arrangements are used to control electric fields.

##### Real-World Applications
Understanding forces in symmetric charge configurations is essential for designing:
1. **Electrostatic precipitators** (used in air pollution control), where charged particles are manipulated by electric fields.
2. **Capacitive sensors** in touchscreens, which rely on symmetric electrode arrangements.
3. **Particle traps** in atomic physics, where ions are confined using precisely arranged charges.

##### Problem Statement
Three point charges are fixed at the vertices of an isosceles triangle with base length $b$ and height $h$. Charges of magnitude $q$ are located at the base vertices, $(-b/2, 0)$ and $(b/2, 0)$. A charge of magnitude $Q$ is located at the apex vertex, $(0, h)$. A fourth point charge $q_0$ is placed at the centroid of the triangle.

Determine the magnitude of the net electrostatic force acting on $q_0$ due to the other three charges. Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of Coulomb's constant $k$, $q$, $Q$, $q_0$, $b$, and $h$.

**Note**:  
- The centroid coordinates are the arithmetic mean of the vertex coordinates. For this triangle, the centroid is at $(0, h/3)$.  
- The final answer must be expressed as an absolute value to ensure a non-negative magnitude.  
- Use exact symbolic form; no numerical substitutions.

### Solution
The net force on $q_0$ is found by applying Coulomb's law and the superposition principle. We compute the force from each charge and sum them vectorially. Positions:  
- Charge $q$ at $A(-b/2, 0)$  
- Charge $q$ at $B(b/2, 0)$  
- Charge $Q$ at $C(0, h)$  
- Charge $q_0$ at centroid $G(0, h/3)$  

**Step 1: Force due to charge at $A$ on $q_0$**  
Vector $\overrightarrow{GA} = A - G = (-b/2 - 0, 0 - h/3) = (-b/2, -h/3)$.  
Distance $|\overrightarrow{GA}| = \sqrt{(-b/2)^2 + (-h/3)^2} = \sqrt{b^2/4 + h^2/9} = \frac{\sqrt{9b^2 + 4h^2}}{6}$.  
Force magnitude: $|\vec{F}_A| = k \frac{|q q_0|}{|\overrightarrow{GA}|^2}$.  
The direction is along $\overrightarrow{GA}$. The unit vector is $\left( \frac{-b/2}{|\overrightarrow{GA}|}, \frac{-h/3}{|\overrightarrow{GA}|} \right)$.  
Thus,  

$$
\vec{F}_A = k \frac{q q_0}{|\overrightarrow{GA}|^3} \overrightarrow{GA} = k q q_0 \left( \frac{-b/2}{\left( \frac{\sqrt{9b^2 + 4h^2}}{6} \right)^3}, \frac{-h/3}{\left( \frac{\sqrt{9b^2 + 4h^2}}{6} \right)^3} \right).
$$
  
Simplify the denominator:  

$$
|\overrightarrow{GA}|^3 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{9b^2 + 4h^2}}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}}{216}.
$$
  
So,  

$$
\vec{F}_A = k q q_0 \left( \frac{-b/2}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}/216}, \frac{-h/3}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}/216} \right) = k q q_0 \left( \frac{-108b}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}}, \frac{-72h}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} \right).
$$
  

**Step 2: Force due to charge at $B$ on $q_0$**  
Vector $\overrightarrow{GB} = B - G = (b/2 - 0, 0 - h/3) = (b/2, -h/3)$.  
By symmetry, $|\overrightarrow{GB}| = |\overrightarrow{GA}|$. The force is:  

$$
\vec{F}_B = k \frac{q q_0}{|\overrightarrow{GB}|^3} \overrightarrow{GB} = k q q_0 \left( \frac{b/2}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}/216}, \frac{-h/3}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}/216} \right) = k q q_0 \left( \frac{108b}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}}, \frac{-72h}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} \right).
$$
  

**Step 3: Force due to charge at $C$ on $q_0$**  
Vector $\overrightarrow{GC} = C - G = (0 - 0, h - h/3) = (0, 2h/3)$.  
Distance $|\overrightarrow{GC}| = |2h/3| = 2h/3$ (since $h > 0$).  
Force magnitude: $|\vec{F}_C| = k \frac{|Q q_0|}{(2h/3)^2} = k \frac{|Q q_0|}{4h^2/9} = k \frac{9|Q q_0|}{4h^2}$.  
The direction is along $\overrightarrow{GC}$. The unit vector is $(0, 1)$. Thus,  

$$
\vec{F}_C = k \frac{Q q_0}{(2h/3)^2} \cdot (0, 1) = k Q q_0 \cdot \frac{9}{4h^2} \cdot (0, 1) = \left( 0, k Q q_0 \frac{9}{4h^2} \right).
$$
  

**Step 4: Sum the forces**  
Net force components:  
- $x$-component:  

$$
F_{\text{net},x} = F_{A,x} + F_{B,x} + F_{C,x} = k q q_0 \left( \frac{-108b}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} \right) + k q q_0 \left( \frac{108b}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} \right) + 0 = 0.
$$
  
- $y$-component:  

$$
F_{\text{net},y} = F_{A,y} + F_{B,y} + F_{C,y} = k q q_0 \left( \frac{-72h}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} \right) + k q q_0 \left( \frac{-72h}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} \right) + k Q q_0 \frac{9}{4h^2}.
$$
  

$$
F_{\text{net},y} = k q q_0 \left( \frac{-144h}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} \right) + k Q q_0 \frac{9}{4h^2} = k q_0 \left( \frac{-144 q h}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} + \frac{9Q}{4h^2} \right).
$$
  

**Step 5: Magnitude of net force**  
Since $F_{\text{net},x} = 0$, the net force is entirely in the $y$-direction. The magnitude is the absolute value:  

$$
|\vec{F}_{\text{net}}| = \left| k q_0 \left( \frac{-144 q h}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} + \frac{9Q}{4h^2} \right) \right| = k |q_0| \left| \frac{9Q}{4h^2} - \frac{144 q h}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} \right|.
$$
  
Factor out 9:  

$$
|\vec{F}_{\text{net}}| = 9k |q_0| \left| \frac{Q}{4h^2} - \frac{16 q h}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} \right|.
$$
  
The absolute value ensures the magnitude is non-negative for all possible charge signs and values.

### Answer
$$
\boxed{9k \left| q_0 \left( \frac{Q}{4h^2} - \frac{16 q h}{(9b^2 + 4h^2)^{3/2}} \right) \right|}
$$

##### Background
Electric dipoles are fundamental systems in electrostatics, consisting of two equal and opposite charges separated by a fixed distance. When multiple dipoles interact, the net force on a charge is found using the superposition principle. This problem explores the force on a test charge at the intersection point of two perpendicular dipoles, a configuration relevant to molecular physics and materials science where dipole orientations affect intermolecular forces.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Vector superposition of forces in two dimensions.
3. Coordinate-based calculation of force components.
4. Electric dipole structure and charge distribution.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The configuration models cross-oriented molecular dipoles in chemistry and biochemistry, such as in hydrogen bonding networks. It also relates to antenna design in telecommunications where perpendicular dipoles create specific radiation patterns.

##### Real-World Applications
Perpendicular dipole systems appear in liquid crystal displays (LCDs) where molecular orientation affects optical properties, and in scanning probe microscopy techniques that measure nanoscale electrostatic forces between crossed tips.

##### Problem Statement
Two electric dipoles are perpendicular to each other and share a common center at the origin. The first dipole has charges $+q_1$ and $-q_1$ separated by distance $d_1$ along the x-axis, with $+q_1$ at $\left(\frac{d_1}{2}, 0, 0\right)$ and $-q_1$ at $\left(-\frac{d_1}{2}, 0, 0\right)$. The second dipole has charges $+q_2$ and $-q_2$ separated by distance $d_2$ along the y-axis, with $+q_2$ at $\left(0, \frac{d_2}{2}, 0\right)$ and $-q_2$ at $\left(0, -\frac{d_2}{2}, 0\right)$. A test charge $Q$ is placed at the origin $(0,0,0)$.  

Derive the net electrostatic force vector $\vec{F}$ acting on $Q$ due to all four dipole charges. Express $\vec{F}$ in terms of $q_1$, $q_2$, $d_1$, $d_2$, $Q$, and $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}$, using Cartesian unit vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Force due to $+q_1$ on $Q$**  
Position of $+q_1$: $\left(\frac{d_1}{2}, 0, 0\right)$  
Vector from $+q_1$ to $Q$: $\left(0 - \frac{d_1}{2}, 0 - 0, 0 - 0\right) = \left(-\frac{d_1}{2}, 0, 0\right)$  
Distance: $\left|\left(-\frac{d_1}{2}, 0, 0\right)\right| = \frac{d_1}{2}$  
Force by Coulomb's law:  
$$\vec{F}_{+q_1} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{(Q)(q_1)}{\left(\frac{d_1}{2}\right)^2} \cdot \frac{\left(-\frac{d_1}{2}, 0, 0\right)}{\frac{d_1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q q_1}{\frac{d_1^2}{4}} \left(-1, 0, 0\right) = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{4Q q_1}{d_1^2} \hat{i}$$

**Step 2: Force due to $-q_1$ on $Q$**  
Position of $-q_1$: $\left(-\frac{d_1}{2}, 0, 0\right)$  
Vector from $-q_1$ to $Q$: $\left(0 - \left(-\frac{d_1}{2}\right), 0 - 0, 0 - 0\right) = \left(\frac{d_1}{2}, 0, 0\right)$  
Force:

Net force from first dipole:  
$$\vec{F}_{1} = \vec{F}_{+q_1} + \vec{F}_{-q_1} = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{4Q q_1}{d_1^2} \hat{i} - \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{4Q q_1}{d_1^2} \hat{i} = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{8Q q_1}{d_1^2} \hat{i}$$

Force:  
$$\vec{F}_{+q_2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{(Q)(q_2)}{\left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2} \cdot \frac{\left(0, -\frac{d_2}{2}, 0\right)}{\frac{d_2}{2}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q q_2}{\frac{d_2^2}{4}} (0, -1, 0) = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{4Q q_2}{d_2^2} \hat{j}$$

**Step 4: Force due to $-q_2$ on $Q$**

Vector from $-q_2$ to $Q$: $\left(0 - 0, 0 - \left(-\frac{d_2}{2}\right), 0 - 0\right) = \left(0, \frac{d_2}{2}, 0\right)$  
Force:  
$$\vec{F}_{-q_2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{(Q)(-q_2)}{\left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2} \cdot \frac{\left(0, \frac{d_2}{2}, 0\right)}{\frac{d_2}{2}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{-Q q_2}{\frac{d_2^2}{4}} (0, 1, 0) = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{4Q q_2}{d_2^2} \hat{j}$$  
Net force from second dipole:  
$$\vec{F}_{2} = \vec{F}_{+q_2} + \vec{F}_{-q_2} = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{4Q q_2}{d_2^2} \hat{j} - \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{4Q q_2}{d_2^2} \hat{j} = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{8Q q_2}{d_2^2} \hat{j}$$

**Step 5: Total force on $Q$**  
Superposition of all forces:  
$$\vec{F}_{\text{total}} = \vec{F}_{1} + \vec{F}_{2} = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{8Q q_1}{d_1^2} \hat{i} - \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{8Q q_2}{d_2^2} \hat{j}$$  
Factor out constants:

### Answer

### Problem 17
##### Background
In electrostatic systems with symmetric charge distributions, the net force on a charge can be determined using Coulomb's law and the superposition principle. A regular pentagon provides a symmetric arrangement where charges are equidistant from a central point, allowing for the application of geometric and trigonometric properties to simplify force calculations.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Coulomb's law for electrostatic force between point charges.
2. Vector addition of forces using the superposition principle.
3. Symmetry properties of regular polygons.
4. Trigonometric resolution of force components.
5. Exact values of trigonometric functions for specific angles (e.g., 18° and 54°).

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to vector decomposition in physics, rotational symmetry in geometry, and the algebraic simplification of expressions involving radicals and constants. It reinforces the understanding of how symmetric configurations reduce computational complexity.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The solution employs geometric properties of regular pentagons (e.g., internal angles, diagonal lengths) and trigonometric identities from mathematics. It also illustrates how symmetry arguments used in crystallography and molecular physics can be applied to electrostatic systems.

##### Real-World Applications
Understanding force superposition in symmetric charge distributions is crucial in designing electrostatic filters, analyzing crystal lattice stability, and modeling molecular forces in chemistry. The pentagonal symmetry appears in viral capsids, nanoparticle assemblies, and architectural structures.

##### Problem Statement
Five identical point charges, each of magnitude $ q $, are fixed at the vertices of a regular pentagon with side length $ a $. Find the magnitude of the net electrostatic force on any one charge due to the other four charges. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $ q $, $ a $, and Coulomb's constant $ k $. Use exact values and simplify the expression.

**Answer Format Requirements:**
- Express the magnitude as a single analytic expression.
- Use the following notations:
  - Natural logarithm: `\ln`
  - Trigonometric functions: use radians unless specified; for degrees, omit the degree symbol (e.g., `\cos(35)` for 35 degrees).
  - Square roots: `\sqrt{}`
  - Fractions: `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`
- Do not substitute numerical values for constants; retain exact forms.

### Solution
The net force on a charge (e.g., charge 1) is the vector sum of the forces from the other four charges. Due to the pentagon's rotational symmetry, the net force acts along the axis of symmetry passing through charge 1 and the center. We resolve each force into components along this axis and sum them.

**Step 1: Identify force contributions and angles**  
- **Adjacent charges (e.g., charges 2 and 5)**: Distance = $ a $.  
  Force magnitude from one adjacent charge:  
  $$
  F_{\text{adj}} = k \frac{q^2}{a^2}
  $$  
  The angle between the force vector (along the side of the pentagon) and the symmetry axis is 54° (since the internal angle is 108°, and the axis bisects it). The component along the symmetry axis is:  
  $$
  F_{\text{adj},x} = F_{\text{adj}} \cos(54^\circ) = k \frac{q^2}{a^2} \cos(54^\circ)
  $$  

- **Non-adjacent charges (e.g., charges 3 and 4)**: Distance = diagonal length $ d $.  
  For a regular pentagon, $ d = a \phi $, where $ \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} $ (golden ratio). Thus,  
  $$
  d^2 = a^2 \phi^2 = a^2 \left( \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)
  $$  
  Force magnitude from one non-adjacent charge:  
  $$
  F_{\text{diag}} = k \frac{q^2}{d^2} = k \frac{q^2}{a^2} \cdot \frac{2}{3 + \sqrt{5}}
  $$  
  Rationalizing the denominator:  
  $$
  \frac{2}{3 + \sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{3 - \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(3 - \sqrt{5})}{4} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
  $$  
  The angle between the force vector and the symmetry axis is 18° (from geometric properties). The component along the symmetry axis is:  
  $$
  F_{\text{diag},x} = F_{\text{diag}} \cos(18^\circ) = k \frac{q^2}{a^2} \cdot \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \cos(18^\circ)
  $$  

**Step 2: Sum the components**  
The net force magnitude is twice the sum from adjacent and non-adjacent charges (due to symmetry):  
$$
F_{\text{net}} = 2 F_{\text{adj},x} + 2 F_{\text{diag},x} = 2k \frac{q^2}{a^2} \cos(54^\circ) + 2k \frac{q^2}{a^2} \cdot \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \cos(18^\circ)
$$  
Simplify:  
$$
F_{\text{net}} = \frac{2k q^2}{a^2} \left[ \cos(54^\circ) + \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \cos(18^\circ) \right]
$$  

**Step 3: Substitute exact trigonometric values**  
- $\cos(54^\circ) = \sin(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}$  
- $\cos(18^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}$  

Substitute:  
$$
F_{\text{net}} = \frac{2k q^2}{a^2} \left[ \frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} + \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \right]
$$  
Factor out $\frac{1}{4}$:  
$$
F_{\text{net}} = \frac{2k q^2}{a^2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \left[ \sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}} + \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}} \right] = \frac{k q^2}{2a^2} \left[ \sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}} + \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}} \right]
$$  

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
Let $ S = \sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}} + \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}} $. Compute $ S^2 $:  
$$
S^2 = \left( \sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 2 \cdot \sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}} + \left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}} \right)^2
$$  
Simplify each term:  
- First term: $ 10 - 2\sqrt{5} $  
- Second term: $ (3 - \sqrt{5}) \sqrt{ (10 - 2\sqrt{5})(10 + 2\sqrt{5}) } = (3 - \sqrt{5}) \sqrt{100 - 20} = (3 - \sqrt{5}) \sqrt{80} = (3 - \sqrt{5}) \cdot 4\sqrt{5} = 4(3\sqrt{5} - 5) $  
- Third term: $ \left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 (10 + 2\sqrt{5}) = \frac{(3 - \sqrt{5})^2}{4} \cdot 2(5 + \sqrt{5}) = \frac{9 - 6\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} \cdot 2(5 + \sqrt{5}) = \frac{14 - 6\sqrt{5}}{4} \cdot 2(5 + \sqrt{5}) = \frac{14 - 6\sqrt{5}}{2} (5 + \sqrt{5}) = (7 - 3\sqrt{5})(5 + \sqrt{5}) $  
  Expand: $ 7 \cdot 5 + 7 \cdot \sqrt{5} - 3\sqrt{5} \cdot 5 - 3\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{5} = 35 + 7\sqrt{5} - 15\sqrt{5} - 15 = 20 - 8\sqrt{5} $  

Combine all terms:  
$$
S^2 = (10 - 2\sqrt{5}) + 4(3\sqrt{5} - 5) + (20 - 8\sqrt{5}) = 10 - 2\sqrt{5} + 12\sqrt{5} - 20 + 20 - 8\sqrt{5} = (10 - 20 + 20) + (-2\sqrt{5} + 12\sqrt{5} - 8\sqrt{5}) = 10 + 2\sqrt{5}
$$  
Thus,  
$$
S = \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}
$$  
since $ S > 0 $. The net force is:  
$$
F_{\text{net}} = \frac{k q^2}{2a^2} S = \frac{k q^2}{2a^2} \sqrt{10 + 2\sqrt{5}}
$$  
This is the magnitude of the net electrostatic force.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{k q^{2} \sqrt{10 + 2 \sqrt{5}}}{2 a^{2}}}$$

### Problem 18
##### Background
In atomic force microscopy, a charged probe scans surfaces to detect electrostatic forces. Consider a simplified model where four identical ions are fixed at the corners of a square platform with side length $a$, lying in the $xy$-plane centered at the origin. The ions each carry charge $Q$. A probe modeled as a point charge $q$ is positioned at a height $d$ directly above the center of the square along the $z$-axis.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Coulomb's law for electrostatic force between point charges.
2. Principle of superposition for vector forces.
3. Vector decomposition in three dimensions.
4. Symmetry analysis in charge configurations.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to electric field theory, as the force on the probe relates to the field generated by the fixed charges. It also reinforces vector mathematics, essential for electromagnetism and dynamics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The configuration resembles ion traps in quantum computing, where charged particles are confined by electrostatic fields. Understanding force profiles is critical for designing such devices and modeling molecular interactions in physical chemistry.

##### Real-World Applications
Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) uses a charged probe to map surface charge distributions. This problem models EFM calibration, where the force on the probe quantifies charge density or sample properties in nanotechnology and materials science.

##### Problem Statement
The four ions are fixed at $(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}, 0)$, and $(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2}, 0)$. The probe charge $q$ is at $(0, 0, d)$. Determine the net electrostatic force $\vec{F}$ on $q$ due to the four ions. Express $\vec{F}$ in component form using $k$ (electrostatic constant), $Q$, $q$, $a$, and $d$. Justify any components that vanish by symmetry.

### Solution
The net force on $q$ is found by superposition, summing the forces from each ion. Coulomb's law gives the force on $q$ at $\vec{r} = (0,0,d)$ due to a charge $Q_i$ at $\vec{r}_i$:  
$$ \vec{F}_i = k \frac{q Q_i}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i|^3} (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i). $$  
The distance $r$ from any corner charge to $q$ is identical by symmetry. For a corner charge at $(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}, 0)$:  
$$ |\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i| = \sqrt{ \left(0 - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(0 - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + (d - 0)^2 } = \sqrt{ \frac{a^2}{2} + d^2 } \equiv r. $$  
The vector $\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i$ for this charge is $(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2}, d)$. Thus, the force $\vec{F}_1$ is:  
$$ \vec{F}_1 = k \frac{q Q}{r^3} \left( -\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2}, d \right). $$  
For the charge at $(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i = (-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}, d)$, so:  
$$ \vec{F}_2 = k \frac{q Q}{r^3} \left( -\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}, d \right). $$  
For $(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i = (\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2}, d)$, so:  
$$ \vec{F}_3 = k \frac{q Q}{r^3} \left( \frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2}, d \right). $$  
For $(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i = (\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}, d)$, so:  
$$ \vec{F}_4 = k \frac{q Q}{r^3} \left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2}, d \right). $$  
Summing the $x$-components:  
$$ F_x = \frac{k q Q}{r^3} \left[ -\frac{a}{2} - \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2} \right] = 0. $$  
Summing the $y$-components:  
$$ F_y = \frac{k q Q}{r^3} \left[ -\frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2} - \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2} \right] = 0. $$  
The $x$ and $y$ components vanish due to symmetry: forces from diagonally opposite charges cancel pairwise. Summing the $z$-components:  
$$ F_z = \frac{k q Q}{r^3} \left[ d + d + d + d \right] = \frac{4 k q Q d}{r^3}. $$  
Substituting $r = \sqrt{ \frac{a^2}{2} + d^2 }$:  
$$ r^3 = \left( \frac{a^2}{2} + d^2 \right)^{3/2}. $$  
Thus, the net force is:  
$$ \vec{F} = \left( 0,\ 0,\ \frac{4 k q Q d}{\left( \frac{a^2}{2} + d^2 \right)^{3/2}} \right). $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \left( 0,\ 0,\ \dfrac{4 k q Q d}{\left( \dfrac{a^{2}}{2} + d^{2} \right)^{3/2}} \right) }$$

### Problem 19
##### Background
In microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) used in sensors and actuators, charged components are often arranged in specific geometric patterns to control electrostatic forces. Consider an L-shaped configuration of three point charges, inspired by MEMS design principles. The corner charge is positioned at the origin, with two other charges fixed along the positive x- and y-axes. This arrangement models how forces can be engineered in miniaturized devices.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Coulomb's law for electrostatic force between point charges.
2. Vector superposition of forces in two dimensions.
3. Magnitude calculation of a resultant force vector.
4. Coordinate geometry for charge positions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to electric field calculations (since force relates to field via $ \vec{F} = q\vec{E} $) and potential energy concepts. It extends to continuous charge distributions by demonstrating discrete superposition principles.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The L-shape geometry appears in circuit board layouts (electrical engineering) and crystallography (materials science). The vector addition technique is fundamental to statics in mechanical engineering and kinematics in robotics.

##### Real-World Applications
- MEMS accelerometers use similar charge configurations to detect directional forces.
- Atomic force microscopy employs electrostatic forces between charged tips and samples, requiring precise force calculations.
- Particle trapping in biophysics often involves asymmetric charge arrangements for controlled manipulation.

##### Problem Statement
Three point charges are fixed in an L-shaped configuration:
- Charge $ q_0 $ at the origin $ (0, 0) $.
- Charge $ q_1 $ at $ (a, 0) $, where $ a > 0 $.
- Charge $ q_2 $ at $ (0, b) $, where $ b > 0 $.

The charges $ q_0 $, $ q_1 $, and $ q_2 $ may be positive or negative. Derive the magnitude of the net electrostatic force on $ q_0 $ due to $ q_1 $ and $ q_2 $. Express your answer symbolically in terms of the Coulomb constant $ k $, the charges $ q_0 $, $ q_1 $, and $ q_2 $, and the distances $ a $ and $ b $.  
**Final Answer Format Requirements**:  
- Provide only the magnitude expression enclosed in \boxed{}.  
- Use absolute values where necessary to ensure the expression is non-negative.  
- Do not simplify by substituting numerical values for physical constants.

### Solution
The net force on $ q_0 $ is the vector sum of the forces due to $ q_1 $ and $ q_2 $. We compute each force using Coulomb's law and then find the magnitude of the resultant vector.

**Step 1: Force on $ q_0 $ due to $ q_1 $**  
- Distance between $ q_0 $ and $ q_1 $: $ a $.  
- The force vector $ \vec{F}_{10} $ (force on $ q_0 $ from $ q_1 $) is directed along the line joining them. The unit vector from $ q_1 $ to $ q_0 $ is $ \frac{(0 - a, 0 - 0)}{a} = (-1, 0) $.  
- By Coulomb's law:  

$$
\vec{F}_{10} = k \frac{q_0 q_1}{a^2} \cdot (-1, 0) = \left( -k \frac{q_0 q_1}{a^2},\  0 \right).
$$


**Step 2: Force on $ q_0 $ due to $ q_2 $**  
- Distance between $ q_0 $ and $ q_2 $: $ b $.  
- The unit vector from $ q_2 $ to $ q_0 $ is $ \frac{(0 - 0, 0 - b)}{b} = (0, -1) $.  
- By Coulomb's law:  

$$
\vec{F}_{20} = k \frac{q_0 q_2}{b^2} \cdot (0, -1) = \left( 0,\ -k \frac{q_0 q_2}{b^2} \right).
$$


**Step 3: Net force vector on $ q_0 $**  
- Superposition gives:  

$$
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_{10} + \vec{F}_{20} = \left( -k \frac{q_0 q_1}{a^2},\ -k \frac{q_0 q_2}{b^2} \right).
$$


**Step 4: Magnitude of net force**  
- The magnitude is $ |\vec{F}_{\text{net}}| = \sqrt{ F_x^2 + F_y^2 } $, where:  

$$
F_x = -k \frac{q_0 q_1}{a^2}, \quad F_y = -k \frac{q_0 q_2}{b^2}.
$$
  
- Thus,  

$$
|\vec{F}_{\text{net}}| = \sqrt{ \left( -k \frac{q_0 q_1}{a^2} \right)^2 + \left( -k \frac{q_0 q_2}{b^2} \right)^2 } = \sqrt{ k^2 \frac{q_0^2 q_1^2}{a^4} + k^2 \frac{q_0^2 q_2^2}{b^4} }.
$$
  
- Factor out common terms:  

$$
|\vec{F}_{\text{net}}| = k \sqrt{ q_0^2 \left( \frac{q_1^2}{a^4} + \frac{q_2^2}{b^4} \right) } = k |q_0| \sqrt{ \frac{q_1^2}{a^4} + \frac{q_2^2}{b^4} },
$$
  
since $ \sqrt{q_0^2} = |q_0| $ to ensure non-negativity. The expression under the square root is always positive.

### Answer
$$\boxed{ k \left| q_0 \right| \sqrt{ \dfrac{q_1^{2}}{a^{4}} + \dfrac{q_2^{2}}{b^{4}} }$$

------
### Problem 2
##### Background
In an experimental setup, two fixed positive point charges, $ Q_1 $ and $ Q_2 $, are placed along the x-axis at positions $ x = 0 $ and $ x = d $, respectively. A small bead with a negative charge $ -q $ (where $ q > 0 $) is free to move along the x-axis. The goal is to determine the point where this bead experiences zero net electrostatic force. This scenario models systems like electrostatic levitation devices or particle traps, where equilibrium positions are critical for stability.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Coulomb's law for electrostatic force between point charges.
2. Principle of superposition for vector forces.
3. Equilibrium condition (net force equals zero).
4. Solving quadratic equations derived from physical constraints.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to electric field concepts: the equilibrium point coincides with the location where the electric field due to $ Q_1 $ and $ Q_2 $ is zero. It also relates to potential energy minimization, as stable equilibrium occurs at a local minimum of the system's potential energy.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The mathematical framework applies to gravitational systems, such as finding the point between two celestial bodies where gravitational forces balance (e.g., Lagrange points). The quadratic equilibrium equation also arises in spring-mass systems and fluid dynamics.

##### Real-World Applications
Determining equilibrium positions of charged particles is essential in mass spectrometry, ion trapping for quantum computing, and electrostatic sorting of colloidal particles. It also aids in designing electrostatic precipitators for air pollution control.

##### Problem Statement
Two positive point charges, $ Q_1 $ and $ Q_2 $, are fixed on the x-axis at positions $ x = 0 $ and $ x = d $, respectively. A negatively charged bead of charge $ -q $ (with $ q > 0 $) is constrained to move along the x-axis. Find the position $ x $ (where $ 0 < x < d $) at which the net electrostatic force on the bead is zero. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $ d $, $ Q_1 $, and $ Q_2 $.  
**Note**: The constant from Coulomb's law ($ k $) will cancel in your derivation and should not appear in the final expression.

### Solution
The net force on the bead at position $ x $ is the vector sum of forces from $ Q_1 $ and $ Q_2 $.  
- Force due to $ Q_1 $ (at $ x = 0 $):  
  Since $ Q_1 > 0 $ and the bead is negative ($ -q $), the force is attractive (toward $ x = 0 $). The distance is $ x $, so:  
  
$$
  \vec{F}_1 = -k \frac{Q_1 q}{x^2} \hat{i}
  $$
  
- Force due to $ Q_2 $ (at $ x = d $):  
  Similarly attractive (toward $ x = d $), with distance $ d - x $:  
  
$$
  \vec{F}_2 = k \frac{Q_2 q}{(d - x)^2} \hat{i}
  $$
  
- Net force:  
  
$$
  \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 = k q \left[ -\frac{Q_1}{x^2} + \frac{Q_2}{(d - x)^2} \right] \hat{i}
  $$
  
Set $ \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = 0 $ for equilibrium:  

$$
-\frac{Q_1}{x^2} + \frac{Q_2}{(d - x)^2} = 0
$$
  
Rearrange to:  

$$
\frac{Q_1}{x^2} = \frac{Q_2}{(d - x)^2}
$$
  
Cross-multiply:  

$$
Q_1 (d - x)^2 = Q_2 x^2
$$
  
Expand and simplify:  

$$
Q_1 (d^2 - 2dx + x^2) = Q_2 x^2
$$
  

$$
Q_1 d^2 - 2Q_1 d x + Q_1 x^2 - Q_2 x^2 = 0
$$
  

$$
(Q_1 - Q_2) x^2 - 2Q_1 d x + Q_1 d^2 = 0
$$
  
This is a quadratic equation $ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ with:  

$$
a = Q_1 - Q_2, \quad b = -2Q_1 d, \quad c = Q_1 d^2
$$
  
The solutions are:  

$$
x = \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a}
$$
  
Substitute coefficients:  

$$
x = \frac{ 2Q_1 d \pm \sqrt{ (2Q_1 d)^2 - 4(Q_1 - Q_2) Q_1 d^2 } }{2(Q_1 - Q_2)}
$$
  
Simplify the discriminant:  

$$
(2Q_1 d)^2 - 4(Q_1 - Q_2)Q_1 d^2 = 4Q_1^2 d^2 - 4Q_1 d^2 (Q_1 - Q_2) = 4Q_1^2 d^2 - 4Q_1^2 d^2 + 4Q_1 Q_2 d^2 = 4Q_1 Q_2 d^2
$$
  
Thus:  

$$
x = \frac{ 2Q_1 d \pm \sqrt{4Q_1 Q_2 d^2} }{2(Q_1 - Q_2)} = \frac{ 2Q_1 d \pm 2d \sqrt{Q_1 Q_2} }{2(Q_1 - Q_2)} = \frac{ Q_1 d \pm d \sqrt{Q_1 Q_2} }{ Q_1 - Q_2 }
$$
  
Factor $ d $:  

$$
x = d \left( \frac{ Q_1 \pm \sqrt{Q_1 Q_2} }{ Q_1 - Q_2 } \right)
$$
  
Rewrite the denominator as $ (\sqrt{Q_1})^2 - (\sqrt{Q_2})^2 = (\sqrt{Q_1} - \sqrt{Q_2})(\sqrt{Q_1} + \sqrt{Q_2}) $:  

$$
x = d \left( \frac{ \sqrt{Q_1} ( \sqrt{Q_1} \pm \sqrt{Q_2} ) }{ (\sqrt{Q_1} - \sqrt{Q_2})(\sqrt{Q_1} + \sqrt{Q_2}) } \right)
$$
  
- For the $ + $ sign:  
  
$$
  x = d \left( \frac{ \sqrt{Q_1} ( \sqrt{Q_1} + \sqrt{Q_2} ) }{ (\sqrt{Q_1} - \sqrt{Q_2})(\sqrt{Q_1} + \sqrt{Q_2}) } \right) = d \left( \frac{ \sqrt{Q_1} }{ \sqrt{Q_1} - \sqrt{Q_2} } \right)
  $$
  
  This gives $ x > d $ or $ x < 0 $ (unphysical for $ 0 < x < d $).  
- For the $ - $ sign:  
  
$$
  x = d \left( \frac{ \sqrt{Q_1} ( \sqrt{Q_1} - \sqrt{Q_2} ) }{ (\sqrt{Q_1} - \sqrt{Q_2})(\sqrt{Q_1} + \sqrt{Q_2}) } \right) = d \left( \frac{ \sqrt{Q_1} }{ \sqrt{Q_1} + \sqrt{Q_2} } \right)
  $$
  
  This satisfies $ 0 < x < d $ for all $ Q_1 > 0 $, $ Q_2 > 0 $.  
Thus, the equilibrium position is:  

$$
x = \frac{ d \sqrt{Q_1} }{ \sqrt{Q_1} + \sqrt{Q_2} }
$$

### Problem 20
##### Background
In the design of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, precise control of electrostatic forces is essential. Consider a simplified model where four point charges are fixed at the vertices of a parallelogram-shaped sensor element. The parallelogram has adjacent sides of length $a$ and $b$, with an included angle $\theta$. Understanding the net force on a specific charge helps engineers predict mechanical stress and stability in such devices.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Coulomb's law for electrostatic force
- Vector superposition of forces
- Trigonometry in vector decomposition
- Coordinate geometry for spatial configurations

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem extends the concept of force superposition to two-dimensional charge distributions, reinforcing vector addition principles from mechanics. It also connects to electric field calculations in continuous charge distributions.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The parallelogram geometry links to crystallography (atomic lattice arrangements) and mechanical engineering (structural analysis of trusses). The trigonometric resolution of vectors is fundamental in robotics and computer graphics.

##### Real-World Applications
- MEMS accelerometers that detect forces via charge displacement
- Electrostatic levitation systems for material processing
- Modeling ionic bonds in crystal structures like sodium chloride

##### Problem Statement
A parallelogram has vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ with adjacent sides $AB = a$, $AD = b$, and included angle $\angle BAD = \theta$. Charges are placed as follows:  
- $+q$ at vertex $A$  
- $+q$ at vertex $B$  
- $-q$ at vertex $C$ (opposite to $A$)  
- $+q$ at vertex $D$  

Using the coordinate system where $A$ is at the origin $(0,0)$, $B$ is at $(a, 0)$, and $D$ is at $(b \cos \theta, b \sin \theta)$, derive the magnitude of the net electrostatic force on the charge at $D$. Express your result symbolically in terms of $k$ (Coulomb's constant), $q$, $a$, $b$, and $\theta$.  

**Answer Format Requirements:**  
1. Provide a **single closed-form analytic expression** for the force magnitude.  
2. Use $\theta$ in radians for trigonometric functions.  
3. Express vectors in Cartesian components.  
4. Final answer must use $\sqrt{\cdot}$ for square roots and explicit fractions.  
5. Do not evaluate trigonometric functions (e.g., leave as $\cos \theta$).

### Solution
**Step 1: Define Position Vectors**  
Place vertex $A$ at $(0,0)$. Then:  
- $B$ is at $(a, 0)$  
- $D$ is at $(b \cos \theta, b \sin \theta)$  
- $C$ (diagonally opposite) is at $A + (B - A) + (D - A) = (a + b \cos \theta, b \sin \theta)$  

**Step 2: Force on $D$ due to $A$**  
- Charge at $D$: $+q$, charge at $A$: $+q$ → Repulsive force.  
- Displacement vector $\vec{r}_{DA} = (b \cos \theta, b \sin \theta) - (0,0) = (b \cos \theta, b \sin \theta)$  
- Distance $|\vec{r}_{DA}| = b$  
- Force $\vec{F}_{AD} = k \frac{(q)(q)}{b^2} \hat{r}_{DA}$, where $\hat{r}_{DA}$ is the unit vector from $A$ to $D$:  
  $$
  \hat{r}_{DA} = \left( \cos \theta, \sin \theta \right)
  $$  
  Thus,  
  $$
  \vec{F}_{AD} = \frac{k q^2}{b^2} (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)
  $$  

**Step 3: Force on $D$ due to $B$**  
- Charge at $D$: $+q$, charge at $B$: $+q$ → Repulsive force.  
- Displacement vector $\vec{r}_{DB} = (b \cos \theta, b \sin \theta) - (a, 0) = (b \cos \theta - a, b \sin \theta)$  
- Distance $|\vec{r}_{DB}| = \sqrt{(b \cos \theta - a)^2 + (b \sin \theta)^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos \theta}$  
- Force $\vec{F}_{BD} = k \frac{(q)(q)}{|\vec{r}_{DB}|^2} \hat{r}_{DB}$, where $\hat{r}_{DB}$ is the unit vector from $B$ to $D$:  
  $$
  \hat{r}_{DB} = \frac{(b \cos \theta - a, b \sin \theta)}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos \theta}}
  $$  
  Thus,  
  $$
  \vec{F}_{BD} = \frac{k q^2}{a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos \theta} \cdot \frac{(b \cos \theta - a, b \sin \theta)}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos \theta}} = k q^2 \frac{(b \cos \theta - a, b \sin \theta)}{(a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos \theta)^{3/2}}
  $$  

**Step 4: Force on $D$ due to $C$**  
- Charge at $D$: $+q$, charge at $C$: $-q$ → Attractive force.  
- Displacement vector $\vec{r}_{DC} = (b \cos \theta, b \sin \theta) - (a + b \cos \theta, b \sin \theta) = (-a, 0)$  
- Distance $|\vec{r}_{DC}| = a$  
- Force $\vec{F}_{CD} = k \frac{(q)(-q)}{a^2} \hat{r}_{CD}$, where $\hat{r}_{CD}$ is the unit vector from $C$ to $D$:  
  $$
  \hat{r}_{CD} = \frac{(-a, 0)}{a} = (-1, 0)
  $$  
  Since the force is attractive, it acts *toward* $C$, opposite to $\hat{r}_{CD}$:  
  $$
  \vec{F}_{CD} = -\left[ -\frac{k q^2}{a^2} (-1, 0) \right] = \frac{k q^2}{a^2} (1, 0)
  $$  
  (Note: The double negative arises because attraction reverses direction relative to the repulsive case.)  

**Step 5: Sum Force Components**  
Net force $\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_{AD} + \vec{F}_{BD} + \vec{F}_{CD}$:  
- $x$-component:  
  $$
  F_x = \frac{k q^2 \cos \theta}{b^2} + k q^2 \frac{b \cos \theta - a}{(a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos \theta)^{3/2}} + \frac{k q^2}{a^2}
  $$  
- $y$-component:  
  $$
  F_y = \frac{k q^2 \sin \theta}{b^2} + k q^2 \frac{b \sin \theta}{(a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos \theta)^{3/2}}
  $$  

**Step 6: Magnitude of Net Force**  
$$
F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2} = k q^2 \sqrt{ \left[ \frac{\cos \theta}{b^2} + \frac{b \cos \theta - a}{(a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos \theta)^{3/2}} + \frac{1}{a^2} \right]^2 + \left[ \frac{\sin \theta}{b^2} + \frac{b \sin \theta}{(a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos \theta)^{3/2}} \right]^2 }
$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{k q^{2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{a^{2}} + \frac{\cos \theta}{b^{2}} + \frac{b \cos \theta - a}{\left(a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b \cos \theta\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\sin \theta}{b^{2}} + \frac{b \sin \theta}{\left(a^{2} + b^{2} - 2 a b \cos \theta\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right)^{2}}}$$

### Problem 21
##### Background
In electrostatics, Coulomb's law describes the force between two point charges. When multiple charges are present, the net force on any charge is the vector sum of the forces exerted by each of the other charges, a principle known as superposition. Consider a configuration of three positive point charges fixed at the vertices of a scalene triangle, where all sides have different lengths. The side opposite a given charge is the side connecting the other two charges. This problem focuses on the net force magnitude on the charge located opposite the smallest side of the triangle.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Coulomb's law for electrostatic force between point charges.
2. Vector superposition of forces.
3. Magnitude of the resultant force using the law of cosines.
4. Application of the law of cosines to relate triangle side lengths and angles.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem integrates vector addition and trigonometry with electrostatic principles, illustrating how geometric properties influence physical forces. It also reinforces the concept of inverse-square dependence in Coulomb's law.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The solution requires trigonometry (law of cosines) from mathematics to determine the angle between force vectors, demonstrating the interdependence of physics and geometry in problem-solving.

##### Real-World Applications
Understanding force superposition is crucial in designing electrostatic systems, such as particle traps in atomic physics, MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors, and analyzing molecular structures in chemistry where charged particles form non-symmetric arrangements.

##### Problem Statement
Three positive point charges, $q_A$, $q_B$, and $q_C$, are fixed at the vertices of a scalene triangle. The side lengths are $BC = a$, $AC = b$, and $AB = c$, where $c$ is the smallest side. The charge opposite side $c$ (i.e., the charge not at vertices $A$ or $B$) is $q_C$. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the net electrostatic force on $q_C$. Express your answer in terms of the Coulomb constant $k$, the charges $q_A$, $q_B$, $q_C$, and the side lengths $a$, $b$, $c$.

### Solution
The net force on $q_C$ is the vector sum of the forces due to $q_A$ and $q_B$. Since all charges are positive, both forces are repulsive.

**Step 1: Individual force magnitudes**  
- Force due to $q_A$ on $q_C$:  
  
$$
  F_{CA} = k \frac{q_A q_C}{b^2}
  $$
  
  This force acts along the line connecting $A$ and $C$, directed away from $A$.  
- Force due to $q_B$ on $q_C$:  
  
$$
  F_{CB} = k \frac{q_B q_C}{a^2}
  $$
  
  This force acts along the line connecting $B$ and $C$, directed away from $B$.

**Step 2: Angle between the forces**  
The angle $\gamma$ between the force vectors $\vec{F}_{CA}$ and $\vec{F}_{CB}$ is equal to the angle at vertex $C$ in triangle $ABC$. By the law of cosines:  

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos \gamma
$$
  
Solving for $\cos \gamma$:  

$$
\cos \gamma = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}
$$


**Step 3: Net force magnitude**  
The magnitude of the net force on $q_C$ is given by the vector addition formula:  

$$
F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{F_{CA}^2 + F_{CB}^2 + 2 F_{CA} F_{CB} \cos \gamma}
$$
  
Substitute $F_{CA}$, $F_{CB}$, and $\cos \gamma$:  

$$
F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{
\left( k \frac{q_A q_C}{b^2} \right)^2 + 
\left( k \frac{q_B q_C}{a^2} \right)^2 + 
2 \left( k \frac{q_A q_C}{b^2} \right) \left( k \frac{q_B q_C}{a^2} \right) \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} \right)
}
$$
  
Factor out $k q_C$:  

$$
F_{\text{net}} = k q_C \sqrt{
\frac{q_A^2}{b^4} + 
\frac{q_B^2}{a^4} + 
\frac{q_A q_B (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}{a^3 b^3}
}
$$
  
The expression under the square root is:  

$$
\frac{q_A^2}{b^4} + \frac{q_B^2}{a^4} + \frac{q_A q_B (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}{a^3 b^3}
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the net force is:  

$$
F_{\text{net}} = k q_C \sqrt{ \frac{q_A^2}{b^4} + \frac{q_B^2}{a^4} + \frac{q_A q_B (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}{a^3 b^3} }
$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{ k  q_{C}  \sqrt{ \frac{q_{A}^{2}}{b^{4}} + \frac{q_{B}^{2}}{a^{4}} + \frac{q_{A} q_{B} \left( a^{2} + b^{2} - c^{2} \right)}{a^{3} b^{3}} } }$$

### Problem 22
##### Background
In a physics experiment, four identical positive point charges, each of magnitude $Q$, are fixed in the xy-plane at specific positions:  
- Two charges on the x-axis at $(d, 0)$ and $(-d, 0)$.  
- Two charges on the y-axis at $(0, d)$ and $(0, 2d)$.  
The charge at $(0, 2d)$ is the subject of interest. Due to the asymmetric positions (specifically, the unequal y-coordinates of the charges on the y-axis), the net electrostatic force on this charge must be computed from first principles. Coulomb's law and the superposition principle govern the interactions.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Coulomb's law**: The force between two point charges is $F = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{r^2}$, where $r$ is the distance between them.  
2. **Superposition principle**: The net force on a charge is the vector sum of forces exerted by all other charges.  
3. **Vector resolution**: Forces must be decomposed into Cartesian components for summation.  
4. **Symmetry analysis**: Identifying cancellations or reinforcements in force components due to geometric arrangements.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- This problem extends the concept of electrostatic forces to 2D configurations, bridging to electric field theory, where vector sums of fields replace forces.  
- It reinforces vector algebra skills critical for analyzing continuous charge distributions and dipole systems.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- Vector decomposition and magnitude calculations are fundamental in mechanics (e.g., net force in statics) and electromagnetics (e.g., magnetic fields).  
- Coordinate geometry is essential for spatial problem-solving in engineering and computer graphics.

##### Real-World Applications
- Calculating electrostatic forces is vital for designing particle traps in mass spectrometers, electrostatic precipitators for pollution control, and capacitive touchscreens.  
- Understanding asymmetric charge arrangements helps model molecular interactions in chemistry and material science.

##### Problem Statement
Calculate the magnitude of the net electrostatic force acting on the charge at $(0, 2d)$ due to the other three charges. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $k$ (Coulomb's constant), $Q$, and $d$.  
**Answer format requirement**: Provide a single closed-form analytic expression. Use $\sqrt{\cdot}$ for square roots and rationalize where necessary. Do not evaluate numerically.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Define the setup and forces
- Charges:  
  - Charge A: $+Q$ at $(d, 0)$.  
  - Charge B: $+Q$ at $(-d, 0)$.  
  - Charge C: $+Q$ at $(0, d)$.  
  - Charge D (test charge): $+Q$ at $(0, 2d)$.  
- Net force on D: $\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_{AD} + \vec{F}_{BD} + \vec{F}_{CD}$, where $\vec{F}_{AD}$ is the force on D due to A, etc.

##### Step 2: Force due to charge at $(d, 0)$
- Distance $r_{AD} = \sqrt{(d - 0)^2 + (0 - 2d)^2} = \sqrt{5d^2} = d\sqrt{5}$.  
- Unit vector from A to D:  
  
$$
  \hat{r}_{AD} = \frac{(0 - d, 2d - 0)}{d\sqrt{5}} = \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right).
  $$
  
- Force $\vec{F}_{AD}$ (repulsive):  
  
$$
  \vec{F}_{AD} = \frac{k Q \cdot Q}{(d\sqrt{5})^2} \hat{r}_{AD} = \frac{kQ^2}{5d^2} \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = \frac{kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}} (-1, 2).
  $$
  
- Components:  
  
$$
  F_{AD,x} = -\frac{kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}}, \quad F_{AD,y} = \frac{2kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}}.
  $$


##### Step 3: Force due to charge at $(-d, 0)$
- Distance $r_{BD} = \sqrt{(-d - 0)^2 + (0 - 2d)^2} = d\sqrt{5}$ (same as $r_{AD}$).  
- Unit vector from B to D:  
  
$$
  \hat{r}_{BD} = \frac{(0 - (-d), 2d - 0)}{d\sqrt{5}} = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right).
  $$
  
- Force $\vec{F}_{BD}$ (repulsive):  
  
$$
  \vec{F}_{BD} = \frac{kQ^2}{5d^2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = \frac{kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}} (1, 2).
  $$
  
- Components:  
  
$$
  F_{BD,x} = \frac{kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}}, \quad F_{BD,y} = \frac{2kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}}.
  $$


##### Step 4: Force due to charge at $(0, d)$
- Distance $r_{CD} = |2d - d| = d$.  
- Unit vector from C to D: $(0, 1)$.  
- Force $\vec{F}_{CD}$ (repulsive along y-axis):  
  
$$
  \vec{F}_{CD} = \frac{kQ^2}{d^2} (0, 1) = \left( 0, \frac{kQ^2}{d^2} \right).
  $$
  
- Components:  
  
$$
  F_{CD,x} = 0, \quad F_{CD,y} = \frac{kQ^2}{d^2}.
  $$


##### Step 5: Sum force components
- x-components (cancel due to symmetry):  
  
$$
  F_x = F_{AD,x} + F_{BD,x} + F_{CD,x} = -\frac{kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}} + \frac{kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}} + 0 = 0.
  $$
  
- y-components (add):  
  
$$
  F_y = F_{AD,y} + F_{BD,y} + F_{CD,y} = \frac{2kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}} + \frac{2kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}} + \frac{kQ^2}{d^2} = \frac{4kQ^2}{5d^2 \sqrt{5}} + \frac{kQ^2}{d^2}.
  $$
  
- Simplify $F_y$:  
  
$$
  F_y = \frac{kQ^2}{d^2} \left( \frac{4}{5\sqrt{5}} + 1 \right) = \frac{kQ^2}{d^2} \left( 1 + \frac{4}{5\sqrt{5}} \right).
  $$


##### Step 6: Compute magnitude of net force
- Since $F_x = 0$, $|\vec{F}_{\text{net}}| = |F_y|$ (positive as all forces repel upward).  
- Rationalize the expression:  
  
$$
  F_y = \frac{kQ^2}{d^2} \left( 1 + \frac{4}{5\sqrt{5}} \right) = \frac{kQ^2}{d^2} \left( \frac{5\sqrt{5} + 4}{5\sqrt{5}} \right).
  $$
  
- Multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{5}$:  
  
$$
  F_y = \frac{kQ^2}{d^2} \cdot \frac{5\sqrt{5} + 4}{5\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{kQ^2}{d^2} \cdot \frac{(5\sqrt{5} + 4) \sqrt{5}}{25} = \frac{kQ^2}{d^2} \cdot \frac{25 + 4\sqrt{5}}{25}.
  $$
  
- Final magnitude:  
  
$$
  |\vec{F}_{\text{net}}| = \frac{kQ^2 (25 + 4\sqrt{5})}{25 d^2}.
  $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{kQ^{2}\left(25 + 4\sqrt{5}\right)}{25d^{2}}}$$

### Problem 23
##### Background
In a physics laboratory experiment, three charged particles are fixed in place on a semicircular frame. The frame has a radius $R$ and lies in the $xy$-plane with its diameter aligned along the $x$-axis. The center of the semicircle is at the origin $(0, 0)$. Charges $q_A$ and $q_B$ are fixed at the endpoints of the semicircle, which are $(-R, 0)$ and $(R, 0)$, respectively. A third charge $q_0$ is fixed at the center $(0, 0)$. The goal is to determine the net electrostatic force on $q_0$ due to the other two charges.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Coulomb's law for the electrostatic force between point charges.
2. Principle of superposition for vector forces.
3. Vector decomposition and addition in Cartesian coordinates.
4. Symmetry considerations in force calculations.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to electric field theory, as the force on a charge can also be interpreted via the electric field produced by other charges. It also reinforces fundamental concepts in electrostatics, such as the inverse-square nature of Coulomb's law and vector addition of forces.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The superposition principle is crucial in wave optics (interference of light waves) and quantum mechanics (wave function superposition). The vector addition of forces is fundamental in classical mechanics, engineering statics, and astrophysics (e.g., gravitational forces in multi-body systems).

##### Real-World Applications
Understanding electrostatic forces is essential in designing particle accelerators, inkjet printers (droplet deflection), and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). It also applies to sensor technologies, such as charge-coupled devices (CCDs), and electrostatic precipitation in air purification systems.

##### Problem Statement
Using the coordinate system described, find the $x$-component of the net electrostatic force on the charge $q_0$ due to $q_A$ and $q_B$. Express your answer symbolically in terms of the Coulomb's constant $k$, the charges $q_A$, $q_B$, $q_0$, and the radius $R$.

### Solution
The net electrostatic force on $q_0$ is the vector sum of the forces exerted by $q_A$ and $q_B$. We will calculate each force using Coulomb's law and then add them component-wise.

**Step 1: Force due to $q_A$ on $q_0$**  
The distance between $q_A$ at $(-R, 0)$ and $q_0$ at $(0, 0)$ is $R$. The direction from $q_A$ to $q_0$ is along the positive $x$-axis. The unit vector in this direction is $\hat{r}_{A0} = (1, 0)$. By Coulomb's law, the force on $q_0$ due to $q_A$ is:  
$$ \vec{F}_{A0} = k \frac{q_0 q_A}{R^2} \hat{r}_{A0} = k \frac{q_0 q_A}{R^2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} $$  
Thus, the $x$-component is $k \frac{q_0 q_A}{R^2}$, and the $y$-component is $0$.

**Step 2: Force due to $q_B$ on $q_0$**  
The distance between $q_B$ at $(R, 0)$ and $q_0$ at $(0, 0)$ is also $R$. The direction from $q_B$ to $q_0$ is along the negative $x$-axis. The unit vector in this direction is $\hat{r}_{B0} = (-1, 0)$. By Coulomb's law, the force on $q_0$ due to $q_B$ is:  
$$ \vec{F}_{B0} = k \frac{q_0 q_B}{R^2} \hat{r}_{B0} = k \frac{q_0 q_B}{R^2} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} $$  
Thus, the $x$-component is $-k \frac{q_0 q_B}{R^2}$, and the $y$-component is $0$.

**Step 3: Net force on $q_0$**  
The net force is the vector sum:  
$$ \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_{A0} + \vec{F}_{B0} = \begin{pmatrix} k \frac{q_0 q_A}{R^2} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -k \frac{q_0 q_B}{R^2} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} k \frac{q_0}{R^2} (q_A - q_B) \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} $$  
The $y$-component is $0$ due to symmetry. The $x$-component of the net force is:  
$$ F_{\text{net},x} = k \frac{q_0}{R^2} (q_A - q_B) $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{k q_0 (q_A - q_B)}{R^2}}$$

### Problem 3
##### Background
In electrostatics, Coulomb's law governs the force between charged particles. Consider a system where three point charges $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$ are fixed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$. The charges are unequal, leading to asymmetric forces that require vector superposition for analysis.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Vector addition of forces in two dimensions.
3. Coordinate geometry of equilateral triangles.
4. Principle of superposition for electrostatic forces.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
The vector decomposition technique is fundamental in classical mechanics (e.g., net force calculations). Trigonometric principles used here are essential in structural engineering for analyzing symmetric frameworks under multiple loads.

##### Real-World Applications
Understanding asymmetric force distributions is critical in designing electrostatic precipitators (air pollution control devices), analyzing molecular structures in crystallography, and optimizing charged-particle beam steering in particle accelerators.

##### Problem Statement
Three point charges $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$ are fixed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$. Using a coordinate system where $q_1$ is at the origin $(0, 0)$, $q_2$ is at $(a, 0)$, and $q_3$ is at $\left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a \sqrt{3}}{2} \right)$, derive the net electrostatic force vector $\vec{F}$ acting on $q_1$. Express $\vec{F}$ in component form $(F_x, F_y)$ using Coulomb's constant $k$, the charges $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$, and side length $a$.  

Ensure all trigonometric functions are evaluated symbolically.  
**Answer format hierarchy**: Provide an analytic expression for $\vec{F}$ as $(F_x, F_y)$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Force on $q_1$ due to $q_2$**  
- Distance between $q_1$ and $q_2$ is $a$.  
- Force magnitude: $ |\vec{F}_{12}| = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{a^2} $.  
- Direction: The vector from $q_2$ to $q_1$ is $(-a, 0)$, so the unit vector is $(-1, 0)$.  
- $\vec{F}_{12}$ components (accounting for sign via $q_1 q_2$):  

$$
\vec{F}_{12} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{a^2} (-1, 0) = \left( -k \frac{q_1 q_2}{a^2},\  0 \right).
$$


**Step 2: Force on $q_1$ due to $q_3$**  
- Distance between $q_1$ and $q_3$ is $a$.  
- Force magnitude: $ |\vec{F}_{13}| = k \frac{|q_1 q_3|}{a^2} $.  
- Direction: Vector from $q_3$ to $q_1$ is $\left( -\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a \sqrt{3}}{2} \right)$, so the unit vector is $\left( -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)$.  
- $\vec{F}_{13}$ components:  

$$
\vec{F}_{13} = k \frac{q_1 q_3}{a^2} \left( -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = \left( -k \frac{q_1 q_3}{2a^2},\ -k \frac{q_1 q_3 \sqrt{3}}{2a^2} \right).
$$


**Step 3: Superposition of forces**  
Net force $\vec{F} = \vec{F}_{12} + \vec{F}_{13}$:  

$$
F_x = \left( -k \frac{q_1 q_2}{a^2} \right) + \left( -k \frac{q_1 q_3}{2a^2} \right) = -\frac{k q_1}{a^2} \left( q_2 + \frac{q_3}{2} \right),
$$
  

$$
F_y = (0) + \left( -k \frac{q_1 q_3 \sqrt{3}}{2a^2} \right) = -\frac{k q_1 q_3 \sqrt{3}}{2a^2}.
$$
  
Thus, the force vector is:  

$$
\vec{F} = \left( -\frac{k q_1}{a^2} \left( q_2 + \frac{q_3}{2} \right),\ -\frac{\sqrt{3} k q_1 q_3}{2a^2} \right).
$$

### Answer
$$
\boxed{ \left( -\dfrac{ k  q_{1}  }{ a^{2} } \left( q_{2} + \dfrac{ q_{3} }{ 2 } \right) ,  -\dfrac{ \sqrt{3}  k  q_{1}  q_{3} }{ 2  a^{2} } \right) }
$$

### Problem 4
##### Background
In electrostatic systems, charged objects experience forces due to other charges, governed by Coulomb's law. When suspended by insulating threads, these objects can reach equilibrium under the combined effects of gravitational, electrostatic, and tension forces. This problem explores a symmetric configuration where a charged sphere hangs between two identical fixed charges, requiring derivation of the tension in the supporting thread.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Vector decomposition of forces into components.
3. Conditions for static equilibrium (net force balance in vertical and horizontal directions).
4. Symmetry principles in physical systems.
5. Coordinate geometry for distance calculations.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to electrostatics (force superposition, electric fields) and mechanics (equilibrium, vector addition).
- Reinforces the concept of inverse-square laws and their applications in force calculations.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications

##### Problem Statement
Two identical positive point charges $Q$ are fixed at positions $(-d, 0)$ and $(d, 0)$ in the $xy$-plane, where the $y$-axis is vertical (positive upward). A small sphere of mass $m$ and positive charge $q$ is suspended by a massless, insulating thread of length $L$ from a fixed point $P$ at $(0, H)$. Due to symmetry, the sphere hangs vertically below $P$ at position $C = (0, y)$, where $y = H - L$. The gravitational acceleration is $g$, and the electrostatic constant is $k$. Assume $H > L > 0$ and that the charges are point charges. Derive an expression for the tension $T$ in the thread at equilibrium. Express $T$ symbolically in terms of $m$, $g$, $k$, $q$, $Q$, $d$, $H$, and $L$.

**Answer format requirements**:
- Provide an analytic expression for $T$ using the given symbolic parameters.
- Use $\cos$ and $\sin$ for trigonometric functions, and specify angles in radians.
- For fractions, use the form $\frac{a}{b}$.
- Explicitly include multiplication operators (e.g., $k \cdot q$).

### Solution
The sphere is in static equilibrium, so the net force on it is zero. We analyze the forces acting on the sphere at point $C = (0, y)$ where $y = H - L$:

1. **Gravitational force**: $\vec{F_g} = -mg \hat{\jmath}$ (downward, along the negative $y$-direction).

2. **Tension force**: The thread exerts a force $\vec{T}$ along the thread toward $P$. Since the sphere hangs vertically below $P$, the thread is parallel to the $y$-axis. Thus, $\vec{T} = T \hat{\jmath}$ (upward, positive $y$-direction).

3. **Electrostatic forces**:  
   - The fixed charge at $(-d, 0)$ exerts a repulsive force $\vec{F_1}$ on $q$ (since both charges are positive).  
   - The fixed charge at $(d, 0)$ exerts a repulsive force $\vec{F_2}$ on $q$.  
   By symmetry, the horizontal components of $\vec{F_1}$ and $\vec{F_2}$ cancel out, leaving only vertical components.  

The distance from $C(0, y)$ to each fixed charge is identical due to symmetry:  
$$r = \sqrt{(0 - (-d))^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(0 - d)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{d^2 + y^2}.$$  
The magnitude of the force from one fixed charge is:  
$$F_{\text{mag}} = k \cdot \frac{q \cdot Q}{r^2} = k \cdot \frac{q \cdot Q}{d^2 + y^2}.$$  

The direction of $\vec{F_1}$ is along the vector from $(-d, 0)$ to $(0, y)$, which is $(d, y)$. The unit vector in this direction is $\left( \frac{d}{\sqrt{d^2 + y^2}}, \frac{y}{\sqrt{d^2 + y^2}} \right)$. Similarly, for $\vec{F_2}$ (from $(d, 0)$ to $(0, y)$), the unit vector is $\left( \frac{-d}{\sqrt{d^2 + y^2}}, \frac{y}{\sqrt{d^2 + y^2}} \right)$.  

The $y$-components of the forces are:  
$$\vec{F_{1y}} = \left( k \cdot \frac{q \cdot Q}{d^2 + y^2} \right) \cdot \frac{y}{\sqrt{d^2 + y^2}} \hat{\jmath} = k \cdot q \cdot Q \cdot \frac{y}{(d^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} \hat{\jmath},$$  
$$\vec{F_{2y}} = \left( k \cdot \frac{q \cdot Q}{d^2 + y^2} \right) \cdot \frac{y}{\sqrt{d^2 + y^2}} \hat{\jmath} = k \cdot q \cdot Q \cdot \frac{y}{(d^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} \hat{\jmath}.$$  
The total electrostatic force in the $y$-direction is:  
$$\vec{F_{\text{elec},y}} = \vec{F_{1y}} + \vec{F_{2y}} = 2 \cdot k \cdot q \cdot Q \cdot \frac{y}{(d^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} \hat{\jmath}.$$  

**Force balance in the $y$-direction**:  
The net force in the $y$-direction must be zero:  
$$T \hat{\jmath} - mg \hat{\jmath} + \vec{F_{\text{elec},y}} = 0.$$  
Substituting $\vec{F_{\text{elec},y}}$:  
$$T - mg + 2 \cdot k \cdot q \cdot Q \cdot \frac{y}{(d^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} = 0.$$  
Solving for $T$:  
$$T = mg - 2 \cdot k \cdot q \cdot Q \cdot \frac{y}{(d^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}.$$  
Since $y = H - L$, substitute this value:  
$$T = mg - 2 \cdot k \cdot q \cdot Q \cdot \frac{H - L}{(d^2 + (H - L)^2)^{3/2}}.$$  

This is the expression for the tension in the thread.

### Answer
$$\boxed{mg - 2 \cdot k \cdot q \cdot Q \cdot \frac{H - L}{\left(d^{2} + \left(H - L\right)^{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}}$$

### Problem 5
##### Background
In electrostatic systems, the net force on a point charge results from the vector sum of forces exerted by all other charges, governed by Coulomb's law. Consider a rectangular arrangement of four point charges. The rectangle has width $a$ and height $b$. The charges are positioned as follows:  
- Charge $Q_1$ at the top-left corner $(0, b)$,  
- Charge $Q_2$ at the top-right corner $(a, b)$,  
- Charge $Q_3$ at the bottom-right corner $(a, 0)$, and  
- Charge $Q_4$ at the bottom-left corner $(0, 0)$.  

The charges have asymmetric values, meaning $Q_1$, $Q_2$, $Q_3$, and $Q_4$ are distinct and may have different signs. The electrostatic force magnitude follows an inverse-square law, with Coulomb's constant denoted as $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications
Such charge configurations model electrostatic interactions in molecules, ionic crystals, and electronic components like capacitors. Understanding net forces is crucial in designing electrostatic levitators, particle traps, and sensors in nanotechnology.  

##### Problem Statement
Calculate the magnitude of the net electrostatic force acting on the charge $Q_4$ at the bottom-left corner $(0, 0)$ due to the other three charges. Express your answer symbolically in terms of the parameters $a$, $b$, $Q_1$, $Q_2$, $Q_3$, $Q_4$, and $k$. Ensure the expression is non-negative and accounts for charge signs.  

**Answer Format Requirements**:  
- Use $k$ for Coulomb's constant.  
- The magnitude must be expressed as a single analytic expression.  
- Do not substitute numerical values; keep all parameters symbolic.  
- Use the notation $\sqrt{\cdot}$ for square roots and $\left| \cdot \right|$ for absolute values where necessary.

### Solution
The net force on $Q_4$ is the vector sum of the forces from $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$. We use Coulomb's law and the superposition principle.  

**Step 1: Force due to $Q_1$ on $Q_4$**  
- Distance: $b$ (along the y-axis).  
- Vector from $Q_1$ to $Q_4$: $(0 - 0, 0 - b) = (0, -b)$.  
- Unit vector in the direction from $Q_1$ to $Q_4$: $(0, -1)$.  
- Force:  
  
$$
  \vec{F}_{14} = k \frac{Q_1 Q_4}{b^2} \cdot (0, -1) = \left( 0, -k \frac{Q_1 Q_4}{b^2} \right)
  $$


**Step 2: Force due to $Q_3$ on $Q_4$**  
- Distance: $a$ (along the x-axis).  
- Vector from $Q_3$ to $Q_4$: $(0 - a, 0 - 0) = (-a, 0)$.  
- Unit vector: $(-1, 0)$.  
- Force:  
  
$$
  \vec{F}_{34} = k \frac{Q_3 Q_4}{a^2} \cdot (-1, 0) = \left( -k \frac{Q_3 Q_4}{a^2}, 0 \right)
  $$


**Step 3: Force due to $Q_2$ on $Q_4$**  
- Distance: $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.  
- Vector from $Q_2$ to $Q_4$: $(0 - a, 0 - b) = (-a, -b)$.  
- Unit vector: $\left( -\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}, -\frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \right)$.  
- Force:  
  
$$
  \vec{F}_{24} = k \frac{Q_2 Q_4}{a^2 + b^2} \cdot \left( -\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}, -\frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \right) = k \frac{Q_2 Q_4}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} (-a, -b) = \left( -k \frac{Q_2 Q_4 a}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}}, -k \frac{Q_2 Q_4 b}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right)
  $$


**Step 4: Sum the force components**  
- Total x-component:  
  
$$
  F_x = -k \frac{Q_3 Q_4}{a^2} - k \frac{Q_2 Q_4 a}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} = -k Q_4 \left( \frac{Q_3}{a^2} + \frac{Q_2 a}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right)
  $$
  
- Total y-component:  
  
$$
  F_y = -k \frac{Q_1 Q_4}{b^2} - k \frac{Q_2 Q_4 b}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} = -k Q_4 \left( \frac{Q_1}{b^2} + \frac{Q_2 b}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right)
  $$
  

**Step 5: Magnitude of net force**  
The net force magnitude is:  

$$
F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2}
$$
  
Substitute $F_x$ and $F_y$:  

$$
F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{ \left[ -k Q_4 \left( \frac{Q_3}{a^2} + \frac{Q_2 a}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right) \right]^2 + \left[ -k Q_4 \left( \frac{Q_1}{b^2} + \frac{Q_2 b}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right) \right]^2 }
$$
  
Factor $k^2 Q_4^2$:  

$$
F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{ k^2 Q_4^2 \left[ \left( \frac{Q_3}{a^2} + \frac{Q_2 a}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{Q_1}{b^2} + \frac{Q_2 b}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right)^2 \right] }
$$
  
Since $k > 0$ and the magnitude must be non-negative:  

$$
F_{\text{net}} = k |Q_4| \sqrt{ \left( \frac{Q_3}{a^2} + \frac{Q_2 a}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{Q_1}{b^2} + \frac{Q_2 b}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right)^2 }
$$
  
This is the magnitude of the net electrostatic force on $Q_4$.

### Answer
$$
\boxed{ k |Q_4| \sqrt{ \left( \frac{Q_3}{a^2} + \frac{Q_2 a}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{Q_1}{b^2} + \frac{Q_2 b}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}} \right)^2 } }
$$

### Problem 6
##### Background
In electrostatic systems, the net force on a charge arises from the vector sum of individual Coulomb forces.

##### Problem Statement
Two identical positive point charges, each of magnitude $Q$, are fixed at points $A$ and $B$, separated by a distance $d$. A third positive point charge $q$ is placed at point $P$ on the perpendicular bisector of segment $AB$, at a distance $y$ from the midpoint $O$ of $AB$. Define $R = \sqrt{(d/2)^2 + y^2}$ as the distance from $A$ to $P$. Using a coordinate system with $O$ at $(0,0)$, $A$ at $(-d/2, 0)$, $B$ at $(d/2, 0)$, and $P$ at $(0, y)$, find the angle $\beta$ that the net force on the charge at $A$ makes with the negative x-axis (the line extending leftward from $A$). Express $\beta$ as $\beta = \arctan(\text{expression})$ using $Q$, $q$, $d$, and $y$.

### Solution
**Step 1: Force on charge at $A$ due to charge at $B$**  
The force is repulsive (since $Q > 0$), so it acts away from $B$. As $B$ is to the right of $A$, the force is in the negative x-direction. By Coulomb's law:  
$$ \vec{F}_{AB} = -\frac{k Q^2}{d^2} \hat{i} $$  
Thus, the components are:  
$$ F_{AB,x} = -\frac{k Q^2}{d^2}, \quad F_{AB,y} = 0 $$

**Step 2: Force on charge at $A$ due to charge at $P$**  
The displacement vector from $A$ to $P$ is $\vec{r}_{AP} = (0 - (-d/2), (y - 0)) = (d/2, y)$. The distance $|\vec{r}_{AP}| = R$. The force is repulsive, so it acts in the direction of $-\vec{r}_{AP}$ (away from $P$). Using Coulomb's law:  
$$ \vec{F}_{AP} = k \frac{Q q}{R^3} \left( -\frac{d}{2}, -y \right) = \left( -\frac{k Q q d}{2 R^3}, -\frac{k Q q y}{R^3} \right) $$

**Step 3: Net force on charge at $A$**  
Superposing the forces:  
$$ \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_{AB} + \vec{F}_{AP} = \left( -\frac{k Q^2}{d^2} - \frac{k Q q d}{2 R^3}, -\frac{k Q q y}{R^3} \right) $$  
The components are:  
$$ F_x = -k \left( \frac{Q^2}{d^2} + \frac{Q q d}{2 R^3} \right), \quad F_y = -k \frac{Q q y}{R^3} $$  
Both components are negative, placing $\vec{F}_{\text{net}}$ in the third quadrant.

**Step 4: Angle $\beta$ with the negative x-axis**  
The angle $\beta$ is formed between $\vec{F}_{\text{net}}$ and the negative x-axis. The magnitudes of the components are:  
$$ |F_x| = k \left( \frac{Q^2}{d^2} + \frac{Q q d}{2 R^3} \right), \quad |F_y| = k \frac{Q q y}{R^3} $$  
Thus,  
$$ \tan \beta = \frac{|F_y|}{|F_x|} = \frac{k Q q y / R^3}{k \left( Q^2 / d^2 + Q q d / (2 R^3) \right)} = \frac{q y / R^3}{Q / d^2 + q d / (2 R^3)} $$  
Simplifying by multiplying numerator and denominator by $2 d^2 R^3$:  
$$ \tan \beta = \frac{2 q y d^2}{2 Q R^3 + q d^3} $$  
Therefore,  
$$ \beta = \arctan \left( \frac{2 q y d^2}{2 Q R^3 + q d^3} \right) $$  
where $R = \sqrt{(d/2)^2 + y^2}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\arctan\left(\dfrac{2qyd^{2}}{2QR^{3} + qd^{3}}\right)}$$

### Problem 7
##### Background
In molecular physics and electrostatics, linear arrangements of alternating charges are found in certain ionic crystals and polar molecules. These configurations create complex electric fields. Consider a simplified model where three point charges are fixed along the x-axis: a positive charge $+Q$ at $x = -d$, a negative charge $-Q$ at $x = 0$, and a positive charge $+Q$ at $x = d$. A small positive test charge $+q$ is placed on the x-axis at a position $x > d$.

##### Problem Statement
Three point charges are fixed along the x-axis: $+Q$ at $x = -d$, $-Q$ at $x = 0$, and $+Q$ at $x = d$. A positive test charge $+q$ is placed on the x-axis at $x > d$. Derive the exact position $x$ (in terms of $d$) where the net electrostatic force on the test charge vanishes. Use the Coulomb constant $k$ in your derivation. Express the final answer symbolically as $x = f(d)$, where $f$ is a function of $d$.

### Solution
The net electrostatic force on the test charge $+q$ at position $x > d$ is the vector sum of forces from the three fixed charges. Define the positive x-direction as rightward. Apply Coulomb's law and the superposition principle:

1. **Force from $+Q$ at $x = -d$ (leftmost charge)**:
   - The test charge is positive, so the force is repulsive. Since the test charge is to the right of this charge, the force acts rightward (positive direction).
   - Distance between charges: $x - (-d) = x + d$.
   - Force magnitude: $F_1 = k \frac{(Q)(q)}{(x + d)^2}$.
   - Direction: $+x$, so $F_1 = k \frac{Q q}{(x + d)^2}$.

2. **Force from $-Q$ at $x = 0$ (middle charge)**:
   - The test charge is positive and the fixed charge is negative, so the force is attractive. The test charge is to the right of this charge, so attraction pulls it leftward (negative direction).
   - Distance: $x - 0 = x$.
   - Force magnitude: $F_2 = k \frac{|(-Q)(q)|}{x^2} = k \frac{Q q}{x^2}$.
   - Direction: $-x$, so $F_2 = -k \frac{Q q}{x^2}$.

3. **Force from $+Q$ at $x = d$ (rightmost charge)**:
   - The test charge is positive, so the force is repulsive. The test charge is to the right of this charge, so repulsion pushes it rightward (positive direction).
   - Distance: $x - d$.
   - Force magnitude: $F_3 = k \frac{(Q)(q)}{(x - d)^2}$.
   - Direction: $+x$, so $F_3 = k \frac{Q q}{(x - d)^2}$.

The net force $F_{\text{net}}$ is:

$$
F_{\text{net}} = F_1 + F_2 + F_3 = k Q q \left[ \frac{1}{(x + d)^2} - \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{(x - d)^2} \right].
$$


Set $F_{\text{net}} = 0$ for equilibrium:

$$
\frac{1}{(x + d)^2} - \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{(x - d)^2} = 0.
$$


Simplify the equation:

$$
\frac{1}{(x + d)^2} + \frac{1}{(x - d)^2} = \frac{1}{x^2}.
$$


Introduce the dimensionless variable $u = \frac{x}{d}$ (since $x > d$, $u > 1$):

$$
\frac{1}{(u d + d)^2} + \frac{1}{(u d - d)^2} = \frac{1}{(u d)^2} \implies \frac{1}{d^2 (u + 1)^2} + \frac{1}{d^2 (u - 1)^2} = \frac{1}{d^2 u^2}.
$$


Multiply both sides by $d^2$:

$$
\frac{1}{(u + 1)^2} + \frac{1}{(u - 1)^2} = \frac{1}{u^2}.
$$


Combine the left side over a common denominator:

$$
\frac{(u - 1)^2 + (u + 1)^2}{(u + 1)^2 (u - 1)^2} = \frac{1}{u^2}.
$$


Expand the numerator:

$$
(u - 1)^2 + (u + 1)^2 = u^2 - 2u + 1 + u^2 + 2u + 1 = 2u^2 + 2.
$$


The denominator is $(u^2 - 1)^2$ since $(u + 1)^2 (u - 1)^2 = [(u + 1)(u - 1)]^2 = (u^2 - 1)^2$. Thus:

$$
\frac{2u^2 + 2}{(u^2 - 1)^2} = \frac{1}{u^2}.
$$


Cross-multiply:

$$
(2u^2 + 2) u^2 = (u^2 - 1)^2.
$$


Expand both sides:

$$
\text{Left: } 2u^4 + 2u^2, \quad \text{Right: } u^4 - 2u^2 + 1.
$$


Set equal:

$$
2u^4 + 2u^2 = u^4 - 2u^2 + 1.
$$


Rearrange to form a polynomial equation:

$$
2u^4 + 2u^2 - u^4 + 2u^2 - 1 = 0 \implies u^4 + 4u^2 - 1 = 0.
$$


Solve for $u^2$ using the quadratic formula. Let $v = u^2$:

$$
v^2 + 4v - 1 = 0, \quad v = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = -2 \pm \sqrt{5}.
$$


Since $u > 1$, $v = u^2 > 1$. Note that $-2 + \sqrt{5} \approx -2 + 2.236 = 0.236 > 0$ and $-2 - \sqrt{5} < 0$. Thus, $v = -2 + \sqrt{5}$.  
So:

$$
u^2 = -2 + \sqrt{5} \implies u = \sqrt{-2 + \sqrt{5}} \quad (\text{since } u > 0).
$$


Revert to $x$:

$$
x = u d = d \sqrt{-2 + \sqrt{5}}.
$$


The position where the net force vanishes is $x = d \sqrt{-2 + \sqrt{5}}$.

### Answer

### Problem 8

A third point charge $q$ is placed at $(0, h)$, where $h$ is the perpendicular displacement from the midpoint of the line segment joining $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. The electrostatic force between charges follows Coulomb's law with constant $k$.

##### Problem Statement
Derive an expression for the magnitude of the net electrostatic force acting on the charge $q$. Express your answer symbolically using $k$, $Q_1$, $Q_2$, $q$, $d$, and $h$.  
**Important**:  
- Use exact symbolic forms; do not substitute numerical values.  
- Express the magnitude as a single closed-form analytic expression.  
- Follow the notation rules:  
  - Use $k$ for the Coulomb constant.  
  - For powers, write $(d^2 + h^2)^{3/2}$ using curly braces as shown.  
  - For square roots, use $\sqrt{...}$.

### Solution
The net force on charge $q$ is the vector sum of the forces due to $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. Let $\vec{F}_1$ be the force on $q$ due to $Q_1$, and $\vec{F}_2$ be the force on $q$ due to $Q_2$. By Coulomb's law:  

The distance $r_1$ from $Q_1$ at $(-d, 0)$ to $q$ at $(0, h)$ is:  
$$ r_1 = \sqrt{(-d - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2} = \sqrt{d^2 + h^2}. $$  
Similarly, the distance $r_2$ from $Q_2$ at $(d, 0)$ to $q$ at $(0, h)$ is:  
$$ r_2 = \sqrt{(d - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2} = \sqrt{d^2 + h^2}. $$  
Thus, $r_1 = r_2 = \sqrt{d^2 + h^2} \equiv r$.  

The force $\vec{F}_1$ is directed along the line joining $Q_1$ and $q$. The vector from $Q_1$ to $q$ is $(0 - (-d), h - 0) = (d, h)$. The unit vector in this direction is $\left( \frac{d}{r}, \frac{h}{r} \right)$. Hence,  
$$ \vec{F}_1 = k \frac{Q_1 q}{r^2} \left( \frac{d}{r}, \frac{h}{r} \right) = k Q_1 q \left( \frac{d}{r^3}, \frac{h}{r^3} \right). $$  

Similarly, the force $\vec{F}_2$ is directed along the line joining $Q_2$ and $q$. The vector from $Q_2$ to $q$ is $(0 - d, h - 0) = (-d, h)$. The unit vector is $\left( -\frac{d}{r}, \frac{h}{r} \right)$. Hence,  
$$ \vec{F}_2 = k \frac{Q_2 q}{r^2} \left( -\frac{d}{r}, \frac{h}{r} \right) = k Q_2 q \left( -\frac{d}{r^3}, \frac{h}{r^3} \right). $$  

The net force $\vec{F}_{\text{net}}$ on $q$ is:  
$$ \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 = k q \left[ Q_1 \left( \frac{d}{r^3}, \frac{h}{r^3} \right) + Q_2 \left( -\frac{d}{r^3}, \frac{h}{r^3} \right) \right] = k q \left( \frac{d (Q_1 - Q_2)}{r^3}, \frac{h (Q_1 + Q_2)}{r^3} \right). $$  

The components of $\vec{F}_{\text{net}}$ are:  
- $x$-component: $ F_x = k q \frac{d (Q_1 - Q_2)}{r^3} $,  
- $y$-component: $ F_y = k q \frac{h (Q_1 + Q_2)}{r^3} $.  

The magnitude $F_{\text{net}}$ is:  
$$ F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{ F_x^2 + F_y^2 } = \frac{k q}{r^3} \sqrt{ \left[ d (Q_1 - Q_2) \right]^2 + \left[ h (Q_1 + Q_2) \right]^2 }. $$  
Substituting $r = \sqrt{d^2 + h^2}$:  
$$ r^3 = \left( d^2 + h^2 \right)^{3/2}. $$  
Thus,  
$$ F_{\text{net}} = \frac{k q}{\left( d^2 + h^2 \right)^{3/2}} \sqrt{ d^2 (Q_1 - Q_2)^2 + h^2 (Q_1 + Q_2)^2 }. $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \dfrac{ k q \sqrt{ d^{2} \left( Q_{1} - Q_{2} \right)^{2} + h^{2} \left( Q_{1} + Q_{2} \right)^{2} } }{ \left( d^{2} + h^{2} \right)^{3/2} } }$$

### Problem 9
##### Background
In electrostatic systems, the net force on a point charge arises from the vector sum of forces exerted by other charges, governed by Coulomb's law. This problem examines a symmetric charge configuration in an isosceles triangle, a setup encountered in molecular physics and materials science, where symmetric arrangements of ions or charged particles lead to predictable force patterns. The goal is to derive the magnitude of the resultant force on the apex charge by modeling the superposition of forces from the base charges.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Coulomb's law for electrostatic force magnitude between point charges.
2. Vector superposition principles for forces.
3. Resolution of vectors into components using trigonometry.
4. Symmetry arguments to simplify vector addition.
5. Geometric relationships in isosceles triangles.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to electric field theory, as the force on a charge is foundational for defining electric fields. It also reinforces concepts in vector algebra and Newtonian mechanics, particularly the addition of force vectors and equilibrium conditions.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Mathematics**: Requires vector decomposition, trigonometry (angle determination), and algebraic manipulation of radical expressions.
- **Chemistry**: Models symmetric molecular structures (e.g., water molecule analogs) where electrostatic forces influence geometry.
- **Engineering**: Relevant to electrostatic levitation systems and sensor designs using symmetric charge configurations.

##### Real-World Applications
- **Mass spectrometry**: Symmetric ion traps use similar principles to confine charged particles.
- **Electrostatic precipitation**: Forces on particles in symmetric electrode arrays remove pollutants from gases.
- **Material science**: Predicts stability of crystal lattices with ionic bonding.

##### Problem Statement
Three point charges are fixed at the vertices of an isosceles triangle. The apex charge has magnitude $ q_0 $, and the two base charges each have magnitude $ q $. The base of the triangle has length $ b $, and the height from the apex to the base is $ h $. Derive the magnitude of the net electrostatic force on the apex charge. Express your answer symbolically in terms of the Coulomb constant $ k $, $ q_0 $, $ q $, $ b $, and $ h $.

### Solution
**Step 1: Define the coordinate system and charge positions**  
Place the apex charge at $(0, h)$, and the base charges at $(-b/2, 0)$ and $(b/2, 0)$. The distance $ r $ from the apex to either base charge is:  
$$ r = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + h^2 } = \sqrt{ \frac{b^2}{4} + h^2 } $$  

**Step 2: Apply Coulomb's law for force magnitude**  
The magnitude of the force between the apex charge and one base charge is:  
$$ F = \frac{k q_0 q}{r^2} $$  
This force acts along the line connecting the apex charge to the base charge.  

**Step 3: Resolve forces into components**  
Due to symmetry, the horizontal components of the forces from the two base charges cancel. Only the vertical components contribute to the net force. The angle $ \theta $ between the line connecting the apex to a base charge and the vertical axis satisfies:  
$$ \cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{h}{r} $$  
The vertical component of the force from one base charge is:  
$$ F_y = F \cos \theta = \left( \frac{k q_0 q}{r^2} \right) \left( \frac{h}{r} \right) = \frac{k q_0 q h}{r^3} $$  

**Step 4: Apply superposition for net force**  
The net vertical force is twice $ F_y $ (from both base charges):  
$$ F_{\text{net}} = 2 \cdot \frac{k q_0 q h}{r^3} $$  

**Step 5: Substitute for $ r $**  
Replace $ r $ with the geometric expression:  
$$ r^3 = \left( \sqrt{ \frac{b^2}{4} + h^2 } \right)^3 = \left( \frac{b^2}{4} + h^2 \right)^{3/2} $$  
Thus,  
$$ F_{\text{net}} = \frac{2 k q_0 q h}{ \left( \frac{b^2}{4} + h^2 \right)^{3/2} } $$  

**Final expression for force magnitude:**  
The magnitude of the net electrostatic force on the apex charge is:  
$$ F_{\text{net}} = \frac{2 k q_0 q h}{ \left( h^2 + \frac{b^2}{4} \right)^{3/2} } $$

### Answer
$$ \boxed{\dfrac{2 k q_{0} q h}{\left( h^{2} + \dfrac{b^{2}}{4} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}} $$

## temperature scale conversions (Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit)

### Problem 0
##### Background
In thermometry, the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined using two reference points: the freezing point of water (0°C or 32°F) and the boiling point of water (100°C or 212°F). A linear relationship exists between these scales because equal temperature intervals produce proportional changes. While standard conversion formulas are often memorized, understanding their derivation from fundamental principles is essential for scientific literacy.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Algebraic derivation of conversion formulas  
3. Unit transformation principles  
4. Solving linear equations  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to linear functions in algebra (slope-intercept form) and calibration methods in experimental physics, where instruments are scaled using fixed physical phenomena.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Meteorology**: Weather reports require unit conversions for international data sharing.  
- **Materials Science**: Thermal expansion coefficients often need cross-scale calculations.  
- **Culinary Arts**: Oven temperature settings vary globally (e.g., 180°C vs. 356°F).

##### Real-World Applications
Medical devices like fever thermometers must switch between scales; a hypothermia warning at 35°C (95°F) illustrates critical conversions. Sensor networks in smart homes also process multi-scale temperature data.

##### Problem Statement
Derive the general formula to convert a temperature $T_C$ in degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit using the freezing and boiling points of water as reference. Then, apply this formula to find the Fahrenheit equivalent of 25°C. Express your final answer as an exact numerical value without units.

### Solution
The relationship between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) is linear. Define two reference points:  
- Freezing point of water: $(T_{C1}, T_{F1}) = (0, 32)$  
- Boiling point of water: $(T_{C2}, T_{F2}) = (100, 212)$  

The general linear equation is:  
$$ T_F = a T_C + b $$  
Substitute the first reference point:  
$$ 32 = a \cdot 0 + b \implies b = 32 $$  
Substitute the second reference point:  
$$ 212 = a \cdot 100 + 32 $$  
Solve for $a$:  
$$ 212 - 32 = 100a \implies 180 = 100a \implies a = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $$  
Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_C + 32 $$  

For $T_C = 25$:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 25 + 32 = 45 + 32 = 77 $$  
The exact Fahrenheit equivalent is 77.

### Answer
$$\boxed{77}$$

### Problem 1
##### Background

- Freezing point of water: 0 °C = 273.15 K = 32 °F  
- Boiling point of water: 100 °C = 373.15 K = 212 °F  

##### Knowledge Points Tested

- Applying algebraic reasoning to relate Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit scales.  
- Calculating specific temperature values using derived relationships.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Temperature conversions are essential in meteorology (weather reporting), engineering (material science), culinary arts (international recipes), and environmental science (climate data analysis).  

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate temperature conversion is critical for international scientific collaboration, manufacturing processes requiring precise thermal control, medical equipment calibration, and interpreting weather forecasts across regions using different scales.  

##### Problem Statement
Using the fixed points of water provided in the background, derive a general formula to convert a temperature $T_K$ in Kelvin to degrees Fahrenheit. Then, apply your formula to express absolute zero (0 K) in degrees Fahrenheit. Express your final answer as a numerical value rounded to two decimal places.  

*Note: Your derivation must start from the linear relationships between the scales and use only the given reference points. Do not use pre-memorized conversion formulas.*

### Solution
**Step 1: Establish linear relationships**  
The Celsius (°C) and Kelvin (K) scales are related by:  
$$ T_C = T_K - 273.15 $$  
where $T_C$ is temperature in Celsius and $T_K$ in Kelvin.  

The Celsius and Fahrenheit (°F) scales are related by:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_C + 32 $$  
where $T_F$ is temperature in Fahrenheit.  

**Step 2: Derive the Kelvin-to-Fahrenheit formula**  
Substitute the Celsius-Kelvin relationship into the Celsius-Fahrenheit equation:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} (T_K - 273.15) + 32 $$  
Expand the expression:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_K - \frac{9}{5} \cdot 273.15 + 32 $$  

**Step 3: Compute the constant term**  
Calculate $\frac{9}{5} \cdot 273.15$:  
$$ \frac{9}{5} \cdot 273.15 = 9 \cdot 54.63 = 491.67 $$  
Substitute this result:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_K - 491.67 + 32 $$  
Simplify:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_K - 459.67 $$  

**Step 4: Apply the formula to absolute zero**  
Set $T_K = 0$:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 0 - 459.67 = -459.67 $$  

**Verification using reference points**  
- **Freezing point (T_K = 273.15)**:  
  $$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 273.15 - 459.67 = 491.67 - 459.67 = 32 \quad \text{(matches given)} $$  
- **Boiling point (T_K = 373.15)**:  
  $$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 373.15 - 459.67 = 671.67 - 459.67 = 212 \quad \text{(matches given)} $$  

The derived formula is consistent with the fixed points.

### Answer

The Kelvin scale is an absolute thermodynamic scale where 0 K represents absolute zero (the theoretical absence of thermal energy), and the triple point of water—the unique state where solid, liquid, and vapor phases coexist—is defined as exactly 273.16 K. This triple point occurs at 0.01°C on the Celsius scale.

##### Problem Statement
a) Derive the linear conversion formula from Celsius ($C$) to Kelvin ($K$) using the following information:  
   - Absolute zero (0 K) corresponds to -273.15°C.  
   - A change of 1°C equals a change of 1 K.  
   Express $K$ in terms of $C$ as $K = aC + b$, determining constants $a$ and $b$.  

b) Derive the linear conversion formula from Celsius ($C$) to Fahrenheit ($F$) using:  
   - Freezing point of water: $0^{\circ}\mathrm{C} = 32^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$.  
   - Boiling point of water: $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C} = 212^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$.  
   Express $F$ in terms of $C$ as $F = mC + n$, determining constants $m$ and $n$.  

c) Using the formulas from (a) and (b), convert the triple point of water (0.01°C) to Kelvin and Fahrenheit.  
Express the final temperatures as an ordered pair $(K, F)$, providing exact numerical values without units.

### Solution
##### Solution to Part (a)  
The conversion from Celsius to Kelvin is linear:  
$$ K = aC + b $$  
Given that a change of 1°C equals a change of 1 K, the slope $a = 1$. Thus:  
$$ K = C + b $$  
Absolute zero (0 K) corresponds to -273.15°C:  
$$ 0 = -273.15 + b $$  
Solving for $b$:  
$$ b = 273.15 $$  
The conversion formula is:  
$$ K = C + 273.15 $$  

##### Solution to Part (b)  
The conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit is linear:  
$$ F = mC + n $$  
Using the freezing point ($C = 0$, $F = 32$):  
$$ 32 = m \cdot 0 + n \implies n = 32 $$  
Using the boiling point ($C = 100$, $F = 212$):  
$$ 212 = m \cdot 100 + 32 $$  
$$ 180 = 100m $$  
$$ m = 1.8 $$  
The conversion formula is:  
$$ F = 1.8C + 32 $$  

##### Solution to Part (c)  
For the triple point of water, $C = 0.01$:  
- **Kelvin conversion**:  
  $$ K = 0.01 + 273.15 = 273.16 $$  
- **Fahrenheit conversion**:  
  $$ F = 1.8 \cdot 0.01 + 32 = 0.018 + 32 = 32.018 $$  
The ordered pair is $(273.16, 32.018)$.

$$\boxed{\left(273.16,\ 32.018\right)}$$

### Problem 11
##### Background
Temperature scales are human-defined systems to quantify thermal energy. The Celsius scale (°C), based on water's freezing and boiling points at standard pressure, sets 0°C for freezing and 100°C for boiling. The Kelvin scale (K) is an absolute thermodynamic scale where 0 K represents absolute zero—the point of minimal thermal motion. The Fahrenheit scale (°F), used primarily in the United States, sets water's freezing point at 32°F and boiling point at 212°F. Astronomical observations reveal that the Sun's photosphere (visible surface) emits radiation consistent with a thermal equilibrium temperature of 5500°C. Understanding scale conversions is essential for international scientific collaboration and instrumentation calibration.

- Spacecraft thermal shielding design (e.g., Parker Solar Probe withstands 1377°C using Kelvin-based simulations).
- Global climate models converting between datasets (e.g., NOAA uses Celsius, historical records in Fahrenheit).
- Medical equipment sterilization standards (e.g., autoclaves at 121°C or 250°F).

##### Problem Statement
The Sun’s surface temperature is measured as 5500°C. Derive the conversion formulas from Celsius to Kelvin and from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the following fundamental definitions:  
- Absolute zero is at -273.15°C (0 K).  
- Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) and boils at 100°C (212°F).  
Apply your derived formulas to express the Sun’s surface temperature in Kelvin and Fahrenheit. For the final answer, **provide the difference between the Kelvin and Fahrenheit values** (i.e., $ T_K - T_F $), rounded to five significant figures.  
*Note: All steps must use symbolic algebra until the final numerical substitution. Express temperatures as exact values where possible.*

### Solution
##### Step 1: Derive Celsius to Kelvin conversion  
The Kelvin scale shares the same unit size as Celsius but starts at absolute zero. Given:  
- $ 0  \text{K} = -273.15^\circ \text{C} $  
- A temperature difference of 1 K equals 1°C.  
The linear relationship is:  
$$ T_K = T_C + 273.15 $$  
where $ T_C $ is temperature in Celsius.  

##### Step 2: Derive Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion  
The Fahrenheit scale has a different zero point and unit size. Using the freezing and boiling points of water:  
- At $ T_C = 0 $, $ T_F = 32 $  
- At $ T_C = 100 $, $ T_F = 212 $  
Assume a linear relationship: $ T_F = a \cdot T_C + b $.  
**Substitute freezing point:**  
$$ 32 = a \cdot 0 + b \implies b = 32 $$  
**Substitute boiling point:**  
$$ 212 = a \cdot 100 + 32 $$  
$$ 212 - 32 = 100a $$  
$$ 180 = 100a \implies a = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $$  
Thus:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_C + 32 $$  

##### Step 3: Apply conversions to Sun’s temperature  
Given $ T_C = 5500 $:  
- **Kelvin:**  
  $$ T_K = 5500 + 273.15 = 5773.15  \text{K} $$  
- **Fahrenheit:**  
  $$ T_F = \frac{9}{5}(5500) + 32 = 9 \cdot 1100 + 32 = 9900 + 32 = 9932  ^\circ \text{F} $$  

##### Step 4: Compute $ T_K - T_F $  
$$ T_K - T_F = 5773.15 - 9932 = -4158.85 $$  
Rounded to five significant figures:  
$$ -4158.85 \approx -4158.9 $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{-4158.9}$$

### Problem 12
##### Background
Temperature scales are defined by specific fixed points. The Fahrenheit scale sets the freezing point of water at 32°F and the boiling point at 212°F. The Celsius scale sets the freezing point at 0°C and the boiling point at 100°C. The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale where 0 K represents absolute zero and the size of one Kelvin degree is identical to one Celsius degree. The Kelvin scale is defined such that 0°C corresponds to 273.15 K. These relationships are crucial for scientific applications, such as analyzing extreme conditions on planetary surfaces.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Derivation of linear conversion formulas between temperature scales using defining fixed points.
2. Application of derived formulas to convert a specific temperature value.
3. Understanding the additive offset between Celsius and Kelvin scales.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Problem Statement
Using only the defining fixed points of the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scales, derive the general conversion formula from Fahrenheit to Kelvin. Express the Kelvin temperature $T_K$ as a function of Fahrenheit temperature $T_F$.  
Then, apply this formula to convert Mars' lowest recorded surface temperature of -125°F to Kelvin.  
Round your final answer to two decimal places.  
*Note: Start by deriving the Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion, then Celsius-to-Kelvin. Do not use memorized conversion formulas; derive them from first principles.*

### Solution
**Step 1: Derive Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion formula**  
The relationship between Fahrenheit ($T_F$) and Celsius ($T_C$) is linear. Using the fixed points:  
- Freezing point: $T_F = 32$, $T_C = 0$  
- Boiling point: $T_F = 212$, $T_C = 100$  

The general linear equation is:  
$$ T_C = aT_F + b $$  
Substitute the freezing point:  
$$ 0 = a(32) + b \implies b = -32a $$  
Substitute the boiling point:  
$$ 100 = a(212) + b = 212a - 32a = 180a \implies a = \frac{100}{180} = \frac{5}{9} $$  
Then,  
$$ b = -32 \cdot \frac{5}{9} = -\frac{160}{9} $$  
Thus,  
$$ T_C = \frac{5}{9}T_F - \frac{160}{9} = \frac{5}{9}(T_F - 32) $$  

**Step 2: Derive Celsius-to-Kelvin conversion formula**  
The Kelvin scale ($T_K$) has the same unit size as Celsius but an absolute zero offset:  
$$ T_K = T_C + 273.15 $$  

**Step 3: Combine for Fahrenheit-to-Kelvin formula**  
Substitute $T_C$ from Step 1 into Step 2:  
$$ T_K = \frac{5}{9}(T_F - 32) + 273.15 $$  

**Step 4: Apply to Mars' temperature ($T_F = -125$)**  
Substitute $T_F = -125$:  
$$ T_K = \frac{5}{9}(-125 - 32) + 273.15 = \frac{5}{9}(-157) + 273.15 $$  
Calculate:  
$$ \frac{5}{9} \times (-157) = \frac{-785}{9} \approx -87.222222 $$  
Then:  
$$ T_K = -87.222222 + 273.15 = 185.927778 $$  

**Step 5: Round to two decimal places**  
185.927778 rounded to two decimal places: The third decimal digit is 7 ≥ 5, so round up the second decimal place:  
$$ 185.93 $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{185.93}$$

### Problem 13
##### Background
Temperature scales are essential tools in science and everyday life, with Celsius (°C), Kelvin (K), and Fahrenheit (°F) being the most common. While specific temperature conversions use offset formulas (e.g., °F = (9/5)°C + 32), temperature *differences* behave differently because additive constants cancel out. This distinction is critical in fields like thermodynamics and engineering, where differences drive processes like heat transfer.

##### Problem Statement
The difference between the boiling points of water and ethanol is exactly 21.1°C. Derive a general expression to convert any temperature difference from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Using this expression, compute the equivalent temperature difference in degrees Fahrenheit. Round your final answer to one decimal place.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Establish the Fahrenheit conversion formula  
The standard conversion for a specific temperature is:  
$$ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $$  
where $F$ is the temperature in Fahrenheit and $C$ is the temperature in Celsius.  

##### Step 2: Define the temperature difference  
Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two temperatures in Celsius. The difference in Celsius is:  
$$ \Delta C = C_1 - C_2 $$  

##### Step 3: Express the corresponding Fahrenheit difference  
Convert $C_1$ and $C_2$ to Fahrenheit:  
$$ F_1 = \frac{9}{5}C_1 + 32 $$  
$$ F_2 = \frac{9}{5}C_2 + 32 $$  
The difference in Fahrenheit is:  
$$ \Delta F = F_1 - F_2 = \left( \frac{9}{5}C_1 + 32 \right) - \left( \frac{9}{5}C_2 + 32 \right) $$  

##### Step 4: Simplify the expression  
The additive constant (32) cancels out:  
$$ \Delta F = \frac{9}{5}C_1 - \frac{9}{5}C_2 = \frac{9}{5}(C_1 - C_2) $$  
Substitute $\Delta C = C_1 - C_2$:  
$$ \Delta F = \frac{9}{5} \Delta C $$  
This is the general conversion factor for temperature differences.  

##### Step 5: Apply to the given difference  
Given $\Delta C = 21.1$:  
$$ \Delta F = \frac{9}{5} \times 21.1 $$  

##### Step 6: Compute numerically  
First, simplify $\frac{9}{5}$:  
$$ \frac{9}{5} = 1.8 $$  
Now multiply:  
$$ 1.8 \times 21.1 = 37.98 $$  

##### Step 7: Round to one decimal place  
37.98 rounded to one decimal place is 38.0 (since the digit in the hundredths place, 8, is ≥5).

### Answer
$$\boxed{38.0}$$

### Problem 14
##### Background
Temperature scales are essential in science and daily life. The Celsius (°C) scale is used globally, the Fahrenheit (°F) scale is common in the United States, and the Kelvin (K) scale is the SI base unit for thermodynamic temperature. The conversions between these scales are defined by linear equations. This problem explores a unique condition where the Fahrenheit reading equals half the Celsius reading, requiring a derivation to find the corresponding Kelvin temperature.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conversion formulas between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin temperature scales.
2. Solving linear equations with fractional coefficients.
3. Manipulating exact fractions and constants in algebraic expressions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to linear algebra (solving equations) and thermodynamics (understanding absolute zero and scale relationships). It reinforces the concept that temperature scales are linear transformations of each other.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Temperature conversions are critical in meteorology (weather reporting across regions), engineering (calibrating instruments), and chemistry (reaction kinetics). For example, a chemical engineer might need to convert experimental data from Fahrenheit to Kelvin for thermodynamic modeling.

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate temperature conversion is vital in international collaborations. For instance, a U.S. aerospace engineer working with European colleagues must convert Fahrenheit measurements to Kelvin for spacecraft thermal analysis. Similarly, medical researchers converting body temperature data between scales for global studies rely on precise conversions.

##### Problem Statement
The conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit is given by:
$$ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $$
and the conversion from Celsius to Kelvin is given by:
$$ K = C + 273.15 $$
Find the Kelvin temperature $K$ at which the Fahrenheit reading equals half the Celsius reading (i.e., $ F = \frac{1}{2} C $). Express your answer as an exact fraction. Provide only the numerical value for $K$ without units.

### Solution
We start with the condition that Fahrenheit equals half the Celsius reading:
$$ F = \frac{1}{2} C \quad (1) $$
The conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit is:
$$ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \quad (2) $$
Substitute equation (1) into equation (2):
$$ \frac{1}{2} C = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $$
To solve for $C$, isolate the terms involving $C$ on one side. Subtract $\frac{9}{5}C$ from both sides:
$$ \frac{1}{2} C - \frac{9}{5} C = 32 $$
Find a common denominator for the fractions on the left. The denominators are 2 and 5, so the common denominator is 10:
$$ \frac{5}{10} C - \frac{18}{10} C = 32 $$
Combine the terms:
$$ \frac{5 - 18}{10} C = 32 \implies -\frac{13}{10} C = 32 $$
Multiply both sides by $-\frac{10}{13}$ to solve for $C$:
$$ C = 32 \times \left(-\frac{10}{13}\right) = -\frac{320}{13} $$
Now, convert this Celsius temperature to Kelvin using the conversion formula:
$$ K = C + 273.15 $$
Substitute $C = -\frac{320}{13}$:
$$ K = -\frac{320}{13} + 273.15 $$
Convert 273.15 to a fraction. Since 273.15 = $\frac{27315}{100}$, simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 5:
$$ 273.15 = \frac{5463}{20} $$
Now substitute:
$$ K = -\frac{320}{13} + \frac{5463}{20} $$
Find a common denominator for 13 and 20, which is 260:
$$ K = \frac{-320 \times 20}{260} + \frac{5463 \times 13}{260} = \frac{-6400}{260} + \frac{71019}{260} $$
Combine the fractions:
$$ K = \frac{-6400 + 71019}{260} = \frac{64619}{260} $$
Check if $\frac{64619}{260}$ can be simplified. The prime factorization of 260 is $2^2 \times 5 \times 13$. Test divisibility:
- 64619 is odd (not divisible by 2).
- 64619 ends in 9 (not divisible by 5).
- For 13: divide 64619 by 13 → $13 \times 4970 = 64610$, remainder 9 (not divisible).
Thus, $\frac{64619}{260}$ is already simplified. The Kelvin temperature is $\frac{64619}{260}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{64619}{260}}$$

### Problem 15
##### Background
Temperature scales are essential tools in science, engineering, and daily life. The Kelvin (K) scale is an absolute thermodynamic scale where 0 K represents absolute zero—the point at which all molecular motion ceases. The Celsius (°C) scale, used worldwide, sets water's freezing point at 0°C and boiling point at 100°C. The Fahrenheit (°F) scale, primarily used in the United States, sets water's freezing point at 32°F and boiling point at 212°F. Understanding the relationships between these scales requires deriving conversion formulas from fundamental principles.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Deriving linear conversion formulas between Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit scales using fixed reference points.
- Applying algebraic manipulation to express temperature conversions.
- Understanding the physical significance of absolute zero.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to thermodynamics (absolute zero), algebra (linear equations), and measurement systems. It reinforces the concept that temperature scales are linear transformations of one another.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Physics**: Absolute zero and kinetic theory of gases.
- **Meteorology**: Standard temperature reporting across regions using different scales.
- **Engineering**: Cryogenic systems (e.g., superconductors, MRI machines) operating near 4 K.

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate temperature conversion is critical when:
1. Interpreting data from scientific instruments (e.g., space telescopes reporting in Kelvin).
2. Calibrating medical equipment (e.g., cryopreservation at cryogenic temperatures).
3. Manufacturing materials requiring precise thermal control (e.g., semiconductor fabrication).

##### Problem Statement
A) Derive the formula to convert a temperature $K$ in Kelvin to degrees Celsius ($C$) using the known relationship between absolute zero and the Celsius scale.  
B) Derive the formula to convert $C$ in Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit ($F$) using the freezing and boiling points of water.  
C) Liquid helium, used to cool superconducting magnets, has a temperature of 4 K. Apply your derived formulas to compute its temperature in Fahrenheit. Express your answer as a decimal number.

### Solution
##### Solution

**Part A: Derive Kelvin to Celsius formula**  
Absolute zero (0 K) corresponds to $-273.15^\circ \text{C}$. The Celsius and Kelvin scales share identical unit sizes (a 1 K change equals a 1°C change). Thus, the conversion is linear:  
$$ C = K - 273.15 $$  

**Part B: Derive Celsius to Fahrenheit formula**  
The Fahrenheit scale uses:  
- Freezing point of water: $0^\circ \text{C} = 32^\circ \text{F}$  
- Boiling point of water: $100^\circ \text{C} = 212^\circ \text{F}$  
Assume a linear relationship: $F = mC + b$.  
1. Substitute $(C, F) = (0, 32)$:  
   $$ 32 = m(0) + b \implies b = 32 $$  
2. Substitute $(C, F) = (100, 212)$:  
   $$ 212 = m(100) + 32 $$  
   $$ 180 = 100m \implies m = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $$  
Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $$  

**Part C: Convert 4 K to Fahrenheit**  
1. Convert 4 K to Celsius:  
   $$ C = K - 273.15 = 4 - 273.15 = -269.15 $$  
2. Convert $-269.15^\circ \text{C}$ to Fahrenheit:  
   $$ F = \frac{9}{5}(-269.15) + 32 $$  
   Compute stepwise:  
   $$ \frac{9}{5} \times (-269.15) = 1.8 \times (-269.15) = -484.47 $$  
   $$ -484.47 + 32 = -452.47 $$  
The temperature is $-452.47^\circ \text{F}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{-452.47}$$

2. Derivation of conversion formulas through algebraic reasoning  
3. Combining linear transformations across multiple scales  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

- Aerospace engineering (e.g., re-entry temperatures in Kelvin)  
- Cooking (converting oven temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius)  

##### Problem Statement
Using water's freezing and boiling points as references, derive a direct conversion formula from degrees Fahrenheit to Kelvin. Apply this formula to convert 100°F to Kelvin. Express your final answer as a numerical value (without units) rounded to three significant figures.

### Solution
**Step 1: Derive Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion**  
The relationship is linear: $ T_C = a \cdot T_F + b $.  
Using freezing point (32°F, 0°C):  

$$ 0 = a \cdot 32 + b \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = -32a \quad (1) $$
  
Using boiling point (212°F, 100°C):  

$$ 100 = a \cdot 212 + b \quad (2) $$
  
Substitute (1) into (2):  

$$ 100 = 212a - 32a = 180a \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = \frac{100}{180} = \frac{5}{9} $$
  
From (1):  

$$ b = -32 \cdot \frac{5}{9} = -\frac{160}{9} $$
  
Thus:  

$$ T_C = \frac{5}{9} T_F - \frac{160}{9} = \frac{5}{9} (T_F - 32) $$
  

**Step 2: Derive Celsius to Kelvin conversion**  

$$ T_K = T_C + 273.15 $$
  

**Step 3: Combine for direct Fahrenheit to Kelvin formula**  
Substitute Step 1 into Step 2:  

$$ T_K = \frac{5}{9} (T_F - 32) + 273.15 $$
  

**Step 4: Apply to 100°F**  

$$ T_K = \frac{5}{9} (100 - 32) + 273.15 = \frac{5}{9} \cdot 68 + 273.15 $$
  

$$ \frac{5}{9} \cdot 68 = \frac{340}{9} \approx 37.7778 $$
  

$$ T_K \approx 37.7778 + 273.15 = 310.9278 $$
  
Rounded to three significant figures: 311.  

**Additional note**: The Celsius equivalent is $ T_C = \frac{5}{9}(100 - 32) = \frac{340}{9} \approx 37.8^\circ \text{C} $ (rounded to three significant figures).

### Problem 17
##### Background
In meteorology, the diurnal temperature range (DTR) measures the difference between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures. This range is a critical indicator of climate patterns, especially in desert regions where large temperature swings occur due to low humidity and minimal cloud cover. The Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K) scales are used to measure temperature, but converting a temperature *range* requires understanding how differences scale across these systems. While absolute temperature conversions involve additive constants, range conversions depend solely on the proportional relationship between units.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Derivation of scaling factors for unit conversions from fundamental principles.
3. Algebraic manipulation to isolate variables in linear equations.

- Energy Systems: Solar panel efficiency varies with daily temperature cycles.

##### Problem Statement
A desert weather station records a diurnal temperature range of $ \Delta T_{\text{C}} = 40^\circ \text{C} $. Derive general expressions for the equivalent range in Fahrenheit ($ \Delta T_{\text{F}} $) and Kelvin ($ \Delta T_{\text{K}} $) using only the proportional relationships between the scales. Begin with the absolute temperature conversion formulas:  

$$ T_{\text{F}} = \frac{9}{5} T_{\text{C}} + 32, \quad T_{\text{K}} = T_{\text{C}} + 273.15 $$
  
where $ T_{\text{C}} $, $ T_{\text{F}} $, and $ T_{\text{K}} $ represent temperatures in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, respectively.  

After deriving the general expressions for $ \Delta T_{\text{F}} $ and $ \Delta T_{\text{K}} $ in terms of $ \Delta T_{\text{C}} $, compute the numerical values for $ \Delta T_{\text{C}} = 40 $.  

Present your final answer as two numbers: first the Fahrenheit value, then the Kelvin value, without units.  

**Note**: Temperature ranges (differences) eliminate additive constants in conversions. Use this to simplify your derivations.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Derive the general expression for $ \Delta T_{\text{F}} $  
Let $ T_{\text{C1}} $ and $ T_{\text{C2}} $ be two temperatures in Celsius, with the range $ \Delta T_{\text{C}} = T_{\text{C1}} - T_{\text{C2}} $.  
Convert to Fahrenheit:  

$$ T_{\text{F1}} = \frac{9}{5} T_{\text{C1}} + 32, \quad T_{\text{F2}} = \frac{9}{5} T_{\text{C2}} + 32 $$
  
The range in Fahrenheit is:  

$$ \Delta T_{\text{F}} = T_{\text{F1}} - T_{\text{F2}} = \left( \frac{9}{5} T_{\text{C1}} + 32 \right) - \left( \frac{9}{5} T_{\text{C2}} + 32 \right) = \frac{9}{5} (T_{\text{C1}} - T_{\text{C2}}) = \frac{9}{5} \Delta T_{\text{C}} $$
  

##### Step 2: Derive the general expression for $ \Delta T_{\text{K}} $  
Convert $ T_{\text{C1}} $ and $ T_{\text{C2}} $ to Kelvin:  

$$ T_{\text{K1}} = T_{\text{C1}} + 273.15, \quad T_{\text{K2}} = T_{\text{C2}} + 273.15 $$
  
The range in Kelvin is:  

$$ \Delta T_{\text{K}} = T_{\text{K1}} - T_{\text{K2}} = (T_{\text{C1}} + 273.15) - (T_{\text{C2}} + 273.15) = T_{\text{C1}} - T_{\text{C2}} = \Delta T_{\text{C}} $$
  

##### Step 3: Compute numerical values for $ \Delta T_{\text{C}} = 40 $  
- Fahrenheit range:  

$$ \Delta T_{\text{F}} = \frac{9}{5} \times 40 = 72 $$
  
- Kelvin range:  

$$ \Delta T_{\text{K}} = 40 $$
  

##### Key Insight  
Additive constants (e.g., 32 in Fahrenheit, 273.15 in Kelvin) cancel out when calculating temperature differences. Thus, only the scaling factor $ \frac{9}{5} $ applies for Fahrenheit, while Kelvin ranges match Celsius ranges identically.

### Answer
\boxed{72, 40}

### Problem 18
##### Background  
Temperature scales are essential tools in science, engineering, and daily life. The Celsius scale (°C) is based on water's freezing (0°C) and boiling (100°C) points at standard atmospheric pressure. The Fahrenheit scale (°F) uses 32°F for freezing and 212°F for boiling. The Kelvin scale (K) is an absolute thermodynamic scale where 0 K represents absolute zero, and its degree increment matches Celsius. Gold, a critical material in electronics and jewelry, melts at 1064°C.  

##### Knowledge Points Tested  
1. Derivation of linear conversion formulas between temperature scales using reference points.  
2. Application of algebraic reasoning to relate Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.  
3. Understanding the physical significance of absolute zero and scaling factors.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections  
This problem connects to thermodynamics (absolute zero), algebra (linear equations), and materials science (melting points of elements).  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections  
- **Physics**: Thermodynamic principles defining absolute temperature.  
- **Chemistry**: Phase transitions and material properties.  
- **Engineering**: Calibration of temperature-sensitive instruments across scales.  

##### Real-World Applications  
- Global scientific communication (e.g., reporting melting points in research).  
- Industrial processes (e.g., metallurgy, where precise temperature control is vital).  
- Aerospace engineering (e.g., thermal protection systems using gold alloys).  

##### Problem Statement  
(a) Derive the general linear equation to convert temperature from degrees Celsius ($T_C$) to degrees Fahrenheit ($T_F$) using water's freezing and boiling points.  
(b) Derive the general linear equation to convert $T_C$ to Kelvin ($T_K$) using absolute zero and the Celsius scale's properties.  
(c) Apply your derived equations to express the melting point of gold (1064°C) in Fahrenheit and Kelvin.  
Provide numerical values rounded to **one decimal place for $T_F$** and **one decimal place for $T_K$**. Do not include units in the final answer.

### Solution
**(a) Deriving $T_C$ to $T_F$ conversion**  
The linear relationship is $T_F = a \cdot T_C + b$. Using water's reference points:  
- Freezing: $T_C = 0$ → $T_F = 32$  
- Boiling: $T_C = 100$ → $T_F = 212$  

Substitute freezing point:  
$$ 32 = a \cdot 0 + b \implies b = 32 $$  

Substitute boiling point:  
$$ 212 = a \cdot 100 + 32 \implies 100a = 180 \implies a = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $$  

Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_C + 32 $$  

**(b) Deriving $T_C$ to $T_K$ conversion**  
Kelvin shares the same unit size as Celsius. Absolute zero ($0$ K) corresponds to $-273.15$°C, so:  
$$ T_K = T_C + 273.15 $$  

**(c) Applying to gold's melting point**  
Given $T_C = 1064$:  
- **Fahrenheit**:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 1064 + 32 = \frac{9576}{5} + 32 = 1915.2 + 32 = 1947.2 $$  
Rounded to one decimal place: $1947.2$.  
- **Kelvin**:  
$$ T_K = 1064 + 273.15 = 1337.15 $$  
Rounded to one decimal place: $1337.2$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{1947.2}$$

### Problem 19
##### Background
Temperature scales are defined using fixed reference points. The Celsius (°C) scale uses the freezing point of water (0°C) and boiling point (100°C) at standard atmospheric pressure. The Kelvin (K) scale is an absolute thermodynamic scale where 0 K represents absolute zero (the theoretical minimum temperature), and the size of one kelvin is identical to one degree Celsius. The Fahrenheit (°F) scale defines the freezing point of water as 32°F and the boiling point as 212°F. 

The Delta scale is a hypothetical absolute temperature scale proposed for scientific use. It shares the same zero point as Kelvin (absolute zero) but uses a degree size identical to the Fahrenheit scale. This means a temperature interval of 1 Delta degree equals 1 Fahrenheit degree, but the scale starts from absolute zero.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Understanding linear relationships between temperature scales.
- Deriving conversion formulas using fixed reference points.
- Applying conversion formulas to compute specific values.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects temperature measurement concepts in thermodynamics, including absolute zero, scale calibration, and energy equivalence.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Temperature conversions are essential in chemistry (reaction kinetics), engineering (material science), and meteorology (climate modeling).

##### Real-World Applications
The Rankine scale (used in some engineering systems) is analogous to the Delta scale—an absolute scale with Fahrenheit-sized degrees. Precise temperature conversions are critical in aerospace engineering (e.g., spacecraft thermal management) and cryogenics.

##### Problem Statement
Derive the general conversion formula from degrees Celsius (°C) to the Delta scale. Using this formula, compute the Delta scale temperature equivalent of -50°C. Express your final answer as a decimal number rounded to two decimal places.

### Solution
##### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Convert Celsius to Kelvin**  
   The Kelvin scale is an absolute scale where 0 K = absolute zero. The freezing point of water is 273.15 K. The relationship between Celsius and Kelvin is linear:  
   $$ T_K = T_C + 273.15 $$  
   where $ T_K $ is the temperature in Kelvin and $ T_C $ is the temperature in Celsius.

2. **Relate Kelvin to the Delta Scale**  
   The Delta scale shares the same zero point as Kelvin (absolute zero) but uses Fahrenheit-sized degrees. The size ratio between Fahrenheit and Celsius degrees is derived from the fixed points of water:  
   - Freezing to boiling range in Celsius: 100°C  
   - Freezing to boiling range in Fahrenheit: 180°F (212°F - 32°F)  
   Thus, 1°C = $ \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $ °F.  
   Since the Kelvin and Celsius degrees are identical, 1 K = $ \frac{9}{5} $ Delta degrees.  
   Because both scales start at absolute zero, the temperature in Delta ($ T_{\Delta} $) is proportional to $ T_K $:  
   $$ T_{\Delta} = \frac{9}{5} T_K $$  

3. **Combine the Formulas**  
   Substitute the Kelvin conversion into the Delta formula:  
   $$ T_{\Delta} = \frac{9}{5} (T_C + 273.15) $$  
   This is the general conversion formula from Celsius to Delta.

4. **Apply to $ T_C = -50 $**  
   Substitute $ T_C = -50 $ into the formula:  
   $$ T_{\Delta} = \frac{9}{5} (-50 + 273.15) = \frac{9}{5} (223.15) $$  
   Compute the product:  
   $$ \frac{9}{5} \times 223.15 = \frac{9 \times 223.15}{5} = \frac{2008.35}{5} = 401.67 $$  
   The result is exact and rounded to two decimal places as required.

### Answer
$$\boxed{401.67}$$

### Problem 2
##### Background
Temperature scales are essential in science, engineering, and daily life. The Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) scales relate through a linear transformation:  
$$ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $$  
where $F$ is the temperature in Fahrenheit and $C$ is the temperature in Celsius. This equation converts specific temperatures, but **temperature changes** (Δ) behave differently because the constant offset (32) cancels out when calculating differences. Understanding how to convert temperature changes is crucial for applications like material expansion calculations and climate science.

- Medicine: Ensuring consistent interpretation of temperature changes in clinical studies across countries.  

##### Problem Statement
Starting from the fundamental Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion formula, derive a general equation for converting a temperature change in degrees Celsius (ΔC) to the corresponding change in degrees Fahrenheit (ΔF). Express ΔF solely in terms of ΔC. Then, using your derived equation, calculate the Fahrenheit equivalent of a temperature change of 15°C.  

Provide your final answer as a numerical value without units.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Establish the conversion formula for specific temperatures  
The Celsius-Fahrenheit relationship is:  
$$ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \quad (1) $$  

##### Step 2: Define initial and final states  
Let:  
- $C_1$ = initial temperature in Celsius  
- $C_2$ = final temperature in Celsius  
- $F_1$ = initial temperature in Fahrenheit  
- $F_2$ = final temperature in Fahrenheit  

From Equation (1):  
$$ F_1 = \frac{9}{5}C_1 + 32 \quad (2) $$  
$$ F_2 = \frac{9}{5}C_2 + 32 \quad (3) $$  

##### Step 3: Express temperature changes  
The change in Celsius is:  
$$ \Delta C = C_2 - C_1 \quad (4) $$  
The change in Fahrenheit is:  
$$ \Delta F = F_2 - F_1 \quad (5) $$  

##### Step 4: Derive ΔF in terms of ΔC  
Subtract Equation (2) from Equation (3):  
$$ F_2 - F_1 = \left( \frac{9}{5}C_2 + 32 \right) - \left( \frac{9}{5}C_1 + 32 \right) $$  
Simplify:  
$$ \Delta F = \frac{9}{5}C_2 - \frac{9}{5}C_1 + 32 - 32 $$  
$$ \Delta F = \frac{9}{5} (C_2 - C_1) $$  
Substitute Equation (4):  
$$ \Delta F = \frac{9}{5} \Delta C \quad (6) $$  

##### Step 5: Calculate for ΔC = 15  
Substitute ΔC = 15 into Equation (6):  
$$ \Delta F = \frac{9}{5} \times 15 = 27 $$

##### Problem Statement
A chemist calibrates a thermometer using the freezing and boiling points of water. Derive the general conversion formulas from Celsius to Fahrenheit and from Celsius to Kelvin using these reference points. Apply your formulas to express the boiling point of ethanol (78.4°C) in degrees Fahrenheit and Kelvin.  
- Express Fahrenheit as a numerical value rounded to one decimal place  
- Express Kelvin as a numerical value rounded to two decimal places  
- Provide only numerical values without units in your final expressions

### Solution
**Step 1: Derive Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion**  
The relationship between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) is linear. Using the reference points:  
- Freezing point of water: (0°C, 32°F)  
- Boiling point of water: (100°C, 212°F)  

Let $ F = aC + b $, where $C$ is Celsius and $F$ is Fahrenheit.  
Substitute the first reference point:  
$$ 32 = a(0) + b \implies b = 32 $$  
Substitute the second reference point:  
$$ 212 = a(100) + 32 $$  
Solve for $a$:  
$$ 212 - 32 = 100a \implies 180 = 100a \implies a = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $$  
Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $$  

**Step 2: Derive Celsius to Kelvin conversion**  
Kelvin (K) is an absolute scale with the same unit size as Celsius. The freezing point of water is 273.15 K at 0°C. The general conversion is:  
$$ K = C + 273.15 $$  

**Step 3: Apply formulas to ethanol's boiling point (78.4°C)**  
- **Fahrenheit conversion**:  
  $$ F = \frac{9}{5}(78.4) + 32 $$  
  Calculate:  
  $$ \frac{9}{5} \times 78.4 = 1.8 \times 78.4 = 141.12 $$  
  $$ F = 141.12 + 32 = 173.12 \approx 173.1 \quad \text{(rounded to one decimal place)} $$  

- **Kelvin conversion**:  
  $$ K = 78.4 + 273.15 = 351.55 \quad \text{(exact, no rounding needed for two decimal places)} $$  

**Conclusion**  
The derived formulas are $ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $ and $ K = C + 273.15 $. For ethanol boiling at 78.4°C:  
- Fahrenheit: 173.1  
- Kelvin: 351.55

### Problem 21
##### Background
Liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic fluid widely used in scientific research, medical applications, and industrial cooling due to its extremely low temperature. Its boiling point is a critical parameter for handling and storage. The Celsius (°C), Kelvin (K), and Fahrenheit (°F) scales are interrelated through linear transformations based on fundamental thermodynamic fixed points: absolute zero (0 K), the freezing point of water (0°C or 32°F), and the boiling point of water (100°C or 212°F). 

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Derivation of linear conversion formulas between temperature scales using fixed points.
2. Algebraic manipulation to solve for constants in affine transformations.
3. Application of derived formulas to convert a given temperature.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

- Algebra: Solving systems of linear equations and fractional arithmetic.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- Chemistry: Properties of cryogenic fluids and phase behavior.
- Engineering: Calibration of temperature sensors in extreme environments.
- History of Science: Development of temperature scales (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).

##### Real-World Applications
- Cryopreservation of biological samples requires precise temperature control.
- Superconducting magnets in MRI machines operate at cryogenic temperatures.
- Aerospace engineering uses liquid nitrogen for rocket propulsion testing.

##### Problem Statement
The Celsius-to-Kelvin conversion is defined by $ T_K = T_C + a $, and the Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion by $ T_F = b \cdot T_C + c $, where $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants. Using the fixed points:  
- Absolute zero: $ 0  \text{K} = -273.15  \text{°C} $  
- Freezing point of water: $ 0  \text{°C} = 32  \text{°F} $  
- Boiling point of water: $ 100  \text{°C} = 212  \text{°F} $  

Derive the values of $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $. Then, using these formulas, compute the boiling point of liquid nitrogen ($ -196  \text{°C} $) in Kelvin ($ T_K $) and Fahrenheit ($ T_F $). Finally, evaluate the difference $ T_K - T_F $. Express all results as exact fractions in simplest form.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Derive Constant $ a $ for Celsius-to-Kelvin Conversion
From absolute zero:  

$$
0 = -273.15 + a
$$

Solving for $ a $:  

$$
a = 273.15 = \frac{27315}{100} = \frac{5463}{20}
$$


##### Step 2: Derive Constants $ b $ and $ c $ for Celsius-to-Fahrenheit Conversion
From the freezing point of water ($ T_C = 0 $, $ T_F = 32 $):  

$$
32 = b \cdot 0 + c \implies c = 32
$$


From the boiling point of water ($ T_C = 100 $, $ T_F = 212 $):  

$$
212 = b \cdot 100 + 32
$$

Solving for $ b $:  

$$
212 - 32 = 100b \implies 180 = 100b \implies b = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5}
$$


##### Step 3: Convert $-196  \text{°C}$ to Kelvin
Using $ T_K = T_C + a $:  

$$
T_K = -196 + \frac{5463}{20}
$$

Convert $-196$ to twentieths:  

$$
-196 = -\frac{3920}{20}
$$

Thus:  

$$
T_K = -\frac{3920}{20} + \frac{5463}{20} = \frac{-3920 + 5463}{20} = \frac{1543}{20}
$$


##### Step 4: Convert $-196  \text{°C}$ to Fahrenheit
Using $ T_F = b \cdot T_C + c = \frac{9}{5} \cdot (-196) + 32 $:  
First, compute $\frac{9}{5} \cdot (-196)$:  

$$
\frac{9}{5} \cdot (-196) = -\frac{9 \cdot 196}{5} = -\frac{1764}{5}
$$

Convert $32$ to fifths:  

$$
32 = \frac{160}{5}
$$

Thus:  

$$
T_F = -\frac{1764}{5} + \frac{160}{5} = \frac{-1764 + 160}{5} = -\frac{1604}{5}
$$


##### Step 5: Compute $ T_K - T_F $

$$
T_K - T_F = \frac{1543}{20} - \left( -\frac{1604}{5} \right) = \frac{1543}{20} + \frac{1604}{5}
$$

Convert $\frac{1604}{5}$ to twentieths:  

$$
\frac{1604}{5} = \frac{1604 \times 4}{5 \times 4} = \frac{6416}{20}
$$

Thus:  

$$
T_K - T_F = \frac{1543}{20} + \frac{6416}{20} = \frac{1543 + 6416}{20} = \frac{7959}{20}
$$


The difference $ T_K - T_F $ is $\frac{7959}{20}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{7959}{20}}$$

------
### Problem 22
##### Background
Temperature scales are essential tools in science and engineering for quantifying thermal energy. The Fahrenheit (°F), Celsius (°C), and Kelvin (K) scales are linearly related but use different reference points and unit sizes. The Fahrenheit scale sets water's freezing point at 32°F and boiling point at 212°F under standard atmospheric pressure. The Celsius scale aligns water's freezing point at 0°C and boiling point at 100°C. The Kelvin scale, used in scientific contexts, shares the same unit size as Celsius but sets absolute zero at 0 K, where molecular motion theoretically ceases. The conversion between Kelvin and Celsius is defined as $T_K = T_C + 273.15$, establishing that temperature **differences** in Kelvin and Celsius are identical ($\Delta T_K = \Delta T_C$). 

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Derivation of temperature difference conversion factors from fundamental scale definitions.
- Linear interpolation using fixed reference points (freezing/boiling of water).
- Algebraic manipulation to isolate variables and simplify expressions.
- Application of scale relationships to compute specific temperature changes.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Thermodynamics: Temperature differences govern heat transfer rates (conduction, convection, radiation).
- Material Science: Thermal expansion coefficients depend on temperature changes.
- Climate Science: Temperature anomalies (deviations from baseline) require consistent difference conversions.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- Aerospace: Re-entry vehicle heat shields experience extreme temperature drops; material testing uses Kelvin for accuracy.
- Manufacturing: Quenching metals involves rapid cooling; process specifications often use Kelvin for reproducibility.

##### Problem Statement
Using the freezing point (32°F = 0°C) and boiling point (212°F = 100°C) of water as references:  
(a) Derive the general relationship between a temperature change in Fahrenheit ($\Delta T_F$) and the corresponding temperature change in Kelvin ($\Delta T_K$).  
(b) Apply this relationship to calculate the Kelvin decrease equivalent to a temperature drop of 45°F.  
Express all answers symbolically before numerical evaluation. For part (b), provide the magnitude of the decrease as an exact number.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Establish the linear Fahrenheit-Celsius relationship
The Fahrenheit ($T_F$) and Celsius ($T_C$) scales are linearly related:  
$$ T_C = aT_F + b $$  
Using the reference points:  
1. Freezing point: $T_F = 32$, $T_C = 0$  
$$ 0 = a(32) + b \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = -32a \quad \text{(Equation 1)} $$  
2. Boiling point: $T_F = 212$, $T_C = 100$  
$$ 100 = a(212) + b \quad \text{(Equation 2)} $$  

##### Step 2: Solve for coefficients $a$ and $b$
Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:  
$$ 100 = 212a - 32a = 180a $$  
$$ a = \frac{100}{180} = \frac{5}{9} $$  
Substitute $a$ into Equation 1:  
$$ b = -32 \left(\frac{5}{9}\right) = -\frac{160}{9} $$  
Thus, the conversion equation is:  
$$ T_C = \frac{5}{9}T_F - \frac{160}{9} $$  

##### Step 3: Derive the temperature difference relationship
For two temperatures $T_{F1}$ and $T_{F2}$, the Celsius difference is:  
$$ \Delta T_C = T_{C2} - T_{C1} = \left[ \frac{5}{9}T_{F2} - \frac{160}{9} \right] - \left[ \frac{5}{9}T_{F1} - \frac{160}{9} \right] $$  
The constant terms cancel:  
$$ \Delta T_C = \frac{5}{9}(T_{F2} - T_{F1}) = \frac{5}{9} \Delta T_F $$  
Since $\Delta T_K = \Delta T_C$ (from $T_K = T_C + 273.15$):  
$$ \Delta T_K = \frac{5}{9} \Delta T_F \quad \text{(General relationship)} $$  

##### Step 4: Compute the Kelvin decrease for $\Delta T_F = -45$
A temperature drop of 45°F implies $\Delta T_F = -45$:  
$$ \Delta T_K = \frac{5}{9} \times (-45) = -\frac{225}{9} = -25 $$  
The magnitude of the decrease is $|\Delta T_K| = 25$ K.

##### Problem Statement
A new temperature scale, the "Tungsten Scale" (TS), is defined such that absolute zero corresponds to 0 TS and the melting point of tungsten corresponds to 1000 TS. It is known that absolute zero is -273.15°C and the melting point of tungsten is 3422°C. Using only these reference points and fundamental scale relationships, derive a formula to convert TS to Kelvin. Then, compute the melting point of tungsten in Kelvin using this formula. Express your final answer as a numerical value rounded to one decimal place. Provide only the numerical value.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Establish the linear relationship between TS and Celsius  
The Tungsten Scale (TS) and Celsius (°C) share a linear relationship of the form:  
$$ T_C = a \cdot T_{\text{TS}} + b $$  
where $ T_C $ is the temperature in Celsius, $ T_{\text{TS}} $ is the temperature in TS, and $ a $ and $ b $ are constants.  

##### Step 2: Use reference points to solve for constants  
**Reference Point 1: Absolute zero**  
At absolute zero:  
$$ T_{\text{TS}} = 0, \quad T_C = -273.15 $$  
Substitute into the linear equation:  
$$ -273.15 = a \cdot 0 + b \implies b = -273.15 $$  

**Reference Point 2: Melting point of tungsten**  
At the melting point of tungsten:  
$$ T_{\text{TS}} = 1000, \quad T_C = 3422 $$  
Substitute and solve for $ a $:  
$$ 3422 = a \cdot 1000 + (-273.15) $$  
$$ 3422 + 273.15 = 1000a $$  
$$ 3695.15 = 1000a $$  
$$ a = \frac{3695.15}{1000} = 3.69515 $$  

The conversion formula from TS to Celsius is:  
$$ T_C = 3.69515 \cdot T_{\text{TS}} - 273.15 $$  

##### Step 3: Derive the conversion from TS to Kelvin  
The Kelvin (K) and Celsius scales are related by:  
$$ T_K = T_C + 273.15 $$  
Substitute the expression for $ T_C $:  
$$ T_K = (3.69515 \cdot T_{\text{TS}} - 273.15) + 273.15 $$  
Simplify:  
$$ T_K = 3.69515 \cdot T_{\text{TS}} $$  

##### Step 4: Compute the melting point of tungsten in Kelvin  
At the melting point, $ T_{\text{TS}} = 1000 $:  
$$ T_K = 3.69515 \cdot 1000 = 3695.15 $$  
Rounded to one decimal place:  
$$ T_K = 3695.2 $$

##### Problem Statement
The freezing point of water is defined as 32°F (0°C), and the boiling point is 212°F (100°C). The Kelvin scale sets absolute zero at 0 K and uses the same degree size as Celsius.  
1. Derive the general conversion formula from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C), expressing $ T_C $ in terms of $ T_F $.  
2. Derive the general conversion formula from Celsius (°C) to Kelvin (K), expressing $ T_K $ in terms of $ T_C $.  
3. Combine these to express $ T_K $ directly in terms of $ T_F $.  
4. A patient presents with severe hypothermia at 89.6°F. Use your derived formula to compute their temperature in Kelvin.

*Instructions*:  
- Keep all constants symbolic during derivation.  
- For the final calculation, express $ T_K $ numerically.  
- Use exact fractions; avoid decimal approximations until rounding.  
- Follow notation rules: Use $ \ln $, $ \exp $, and $ \frac{a}{b} $.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Derive $ T_C $ in terms of $ T_F $  
The Fahrenheit-to-Celsius relationship is linear. Using the reference points:  
- Freezing point: ($ T_C = 0 $, $ T_F = 32 $)  
- Boiling point: ($ T_C = 100 $, $ T_F = 212 $)  
The slope $ m $ of $ T_F $ versus $ T_C $ is:  
$$ m = \frac{\Delta T_F}{\Delta T_C} = \frac{212 - 32}{100 - 0} = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $$  
The equation is:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_C + b $$  
Substitute freezing point ($ T_C = 0 $, $ T_F = 32 $):  
$$ 32 = \frac{9}{5}(0) + b \implies b = 32 $$  
Thus:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_C + 32 $$  
Solve for $ T_C $:  
$$ T_C = \frac{5}{9} (T_F - 32) $$  

##### Step 2: Derive $ T_K $ in terms of $ T_C $  
Kelvin and Celsius share the same unit size, with:  
$$ T_K = T_C + 273.15 $$  

##### Step 3: Derive $ T_K $ in terms of $ T_F $  
Substitute Step 1 into Step 2:  
$$ T_K = \left[ \frac{5}{9} (T_F - 32) \right] + 273.15 $$  
Simplify:  
$$ T_K = \frac{5}{9} T_F - \frac{5}{9} \cdot 32 + 273.15 $$  
$$ T_K = \frac{5}{9} T_F - \frac{160}{9} + 273.15 $$  

##### Step 4: Compute $ T_K $ for $ T_F = 89.6 $  
Substitute $ T_F = 89.6 $ into the derived formula:  
$$ T_K = \frac{5}{9} (89.6) - \frac{160}{9} + 273.15 $$  
Calculate each term:  
1. $ \frac{5}{9} \times 89.6 = \frac{5 \times 89.6}{9} = \frac{448}{9} \approx 49.7778 $  
2. $ \frac{160}{9} \approx 17.7778 $  
3. $ 49.7778 - 17.7778 = 32 $  
4. $ 32 + 273.15 = 305.15 $  
Rounded to three significant figures: **305 K** (since 305.15 → 305 when rounded to three significant figures).  
*Note*: $ T_C = \frac{5}{9}(89.6 - 32) = \frac{5}{9} \times 57.6 = 32.0^\circ \text{C} $ confirms consistency.

### Answer
$$\boxed{305}$$

### Problem 25
##### Background
Venus, known for its extreme greenhouse effect, has a surface temperature of 737 Kelvin (K). While Kelvin is the scientific standard, temperature data is often reported in Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) for broader accessibility. The Celsius scale defines 0°C as water's freezing point and 100°C as its boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. The Fahrenheit scale sets water's freezing point at 32°F and boiling point at 212°F. Both scales derive from linear transformations of the Kelvin scale, which uses absolute zero (0 K) as its null point.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Derivation of temperature conversion formulas from fundamental physical reference points.  
2. Application of linear transformations between thermodynamic scales.  
3. Algebraic manipulation of equations involving offsets and scaling factors.  
4. Propagation of units through mathematical operations.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Thermodynamics: Relates to the kinetic interpretation of temperature.  
- Algebra: Requires solving linear equations with defined intercepts and slopes.  
- Measurement science: Involves calibration and scale standardization principles.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- Planetary science: Contextualizes extreme planetary conditions in our solar system.  
- Environmental engineering: Highlights the role of temperature conversions in climate modeling.  
- Data science: Demonstrates unit conversion as a preprocessing step in data analysis.

##### Real-World Applications

- Climate studies: Converting historical temperature records between scales enables unified analysis of global warming trends.  
- Material science: Determines phase transitions of substances under non-Earth conditions.

##### Problem Statement
A scientific probe measures Venus' surface temperature as $T_K = 737  \text{K}$. Derive general expressions for this temperature in degrees Celsius ($T_C$) and degrees Fahrenheit ($T_F$) using only the fundamental reference points:  
- Absolute zero: $0  \text{K}$  
- Water's freezing point: $273.15  \text{K} = 0^\circ \text{C} = 32^\circ \text{F}$  
- Water's boiling point: $373.15  \text{K} = 100^\circ \text{C} = 212^\circ \text{F}$  

First, establish $T_C$ as a function of $T_K$ by modeling the linear relationship between Kelvin and Celsius. Then, derive $T_F$ as a function of $T_C$ using the Fahrenheit and Celsius reference points. Finally, express $T_F$ directly in terms of $T_K$.  

**Answer requirements**:  
1. Present $T_C$ and $T_F$ as analytic expressions in terms of $T_K$.  
2. Provide numerical values for Venus' temperature in °C and °F using $T_K = 737$.  
3. Express all numerical answers as decimals rounded to two significant figures.  
4. Units are specified in the problem; provide only numerical values in your final answer.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Derive Kelvin-to-Celsius conversion  
The Celsius scale has a linear relationship with Kelvin:  
$$ T_C = a T_K + b $$  
Using reference points:  
1. At absolute zero ($T_K = 0$, $T_C = -273.15$):  
   $$ -273.15 = a \cdot 0 + b \implies b = -273.15 $$  
2. At water's freezing point ($T_K = 273.15$, $T_C = 0$):  
   $$ 0 = a \cdot 273.15 - 273.15 \implies a \cdot 273.15 = 273.15 \implies a = 1 $$  
Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$ T_C = T_K - 273.15 $$  
For Venus ($T_K = 737$):  
$$ T_C = 737 - 273.15 = 463.85 \approx 464 \ ^\circ\text{C} \quad \text{(rounded to two significant figures)} $$  

##### Step 2: Derive Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion  
The Fahrenheit scale relates linearly to Celsius:  
$$ T_F = c T_C + d $$  
Using reference points:  
1. At freezing point ($T_C = 0$, $T_F = 32$):  
   $$ 32 = c \cdot 0 + d \implies d = 32 $$  
2. At boiling point ($T_C = 100$, $T_F = 212$):  
   $$ 212 = c \cdot 100 + 32 \implies 100c = 180 \implies c = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $$  
Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_C + 32 $$  
For Venus ($T_C = 463.85$):  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 463.85 + 32 = 834.93 + 32 = 866.93 \approx 870 \ ^\circ\text{F} \quad \text{(rounded to two significant figures)} $$  

##### Step 3: Derive Kelvin-to-Fahrenheit conversion  
Substitute $T_C = T_K - 273.15$ into the Fahrenheit formula:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} (T_K - 273.15) + 32 $$  
Simplify:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_K - \frac{9}{5} \cdot 273.15 + 32 $$  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_K - 491.67 + 32 $$  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_K - 459.67 $$  
For Venus ($T_K = 737$):  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 737 - 459.67 = 1326.6 - 459.67 = 866.93 \approx 870 \ ^\circ\text{F} $$  

##### Final numerical values for Venus:  
- Celsius: $464$  
- Fahrenheit: $870$

### Answer
$$\boxed{464}$$  
$$\boxed{870}$$

### Problem 26
##### Background  
In astrophysics, temperature differences between celestial bodies provide crucial insights into stellar evolution and energy transfer. While Kelvin is the standard unit for absolute temperature in scientific contexts, some historical astronomical datasets and specialized instruments still report temperature differences in Fahrenheit degrees. Understanding how to convert between these scales requires careful consideration of their mathematical relationships.

##### Knowledge Points Tested  
1. Fundamental relationships between Kelvin (K), Celsius (°C), and Fahrenheit (°F) temperature scales.  
2. Conversion of temperature *differences* (as opposed to absolute temperatures).  
3. Algebraic manipulation of linear equations.  
4. Dimensional analysis and unit consistency.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

- Measurement Science: Calibration across different instrument standards.  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Problem Statement  
Two stars in the Cygnus constellation have surface temperatures differing by $\Delta T_K = 500$ Kelvin. Astronomical archives require this temperature difference to be expressed in Fahrenheit degrees ($\Delta T_F$).  

Derive a general expression for $\Delta T_F$ in terms of $\Delta T_K$ by analyzing how temperature differences transform between scales. Start from first principles using the absolute temperature conversion formulas:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32 $$  
$$ T_K = T_C + 273.15 $$  
where $T_C$ is Celsius temperature.  

After deriving the general relationship, compute the numerical value of $\Delta T_F$ for $\Delta T_K = 500$ K. Express your final answer as an exact integer.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Analyze temperature difference conversion  
Consider two temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ in Kelvin, with difference $\Delta T_K = T_2 - T_1$. Convert both to Celsius:  
$$ T_{C1} = T_{K1} - 273.15 $$  
$$ T_{C2} = T_{K2} - 273.15 $$  
The Celsius difference is:  
$$ \Delta T_C = T_{C2} - T_{C1} = (T_{K2} - 273.15) - (T_{K1} - 273.15) = T_{K2} - T_{K1} = \Delta T_K $$  
**Conclusion**: Temperature differences are identical in Kelvin and Celsius ($\Delta T_C = \Delta T_K$).  

##### Step 2: Relate Celsius and Fahrenheit differences  
Convert $T_{C1}$ and $T_{C2}$ to Fahrenheit:  
$$ T_{F1} = \frac{9}{5}T_{C1} + 32 $$  
$$ T_{F2} = \frac{9}{5}T_{C2} + 32 $$  
The Fahrenheit difference is:  
$$ \Delta T_F = T_{F2} - T_{F1} = \left( \frac{9}{5}T_{C2} + 32 \right) - \left( \frac{9}{5}T_{C1} + 32 \right) = \frac{9}{5}(T_{C2} - T_{C1}) = \frac{9}{5} \Delta T_C $$  

##### Step 3: Combine results  
Since $\Delta T_C = \Delta T_K$:  
$$ \Delta T_F = \frac{9}{5} \Delta T_K $$  
This is the general expression for converting temperature differences from Kelvin to Fahrenheit.  

##### Step 4: Compute numerical value  
For $\Delta T_K = 500$ K:  
$$ \Delta T_F = \frac{9}{5} \times 500 = 9 \times 100 = 900 $$  
The temperature difference is exactly 900 Fahrenheit degrees.

### Answer
$$\boxed{900}$$

### Problem 27
##### Background
Temperature scales are defined using fixed reference points. The Fahrenheit (°F) scale sets water's freezing point at 32°F and boiling point at 212°F. The Celsius (°C) scale uses 0°C for freezing and 100°C for boiling. The Kelvin (K) scale is absolute, with 0 K at absolute zero and degrees matching Celsius, where K = °C + 273.15. Scientists in Antarctica recorded a winter temperature of -80°F. To analyze this data, they must convert it to Kelvin, requiring derivation of the conversion formula from first principles.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Linear relationship derivation between temperature scales using fixed points.
2. Algebraic manipulation of conversion formulas.
3. Composition of functions for multi-step conversions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
Connects to thermodynamics (absolute zero concept) and algebra (linear equations and function composition).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Relevant to climatology (polar temperature analysis) and materials science (behavior of substances at low temperatures).

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate temperature conversion is essential for international scientific collaboration, cryogenic engineering, and climate modeling in extreme environments like Antarctica.

##### Problem Statement
Derive the general conversion formula from degrees Fahrenheit (°F) to Kelvin (K) using the fixed points of water and the absolute zero offset. Then, compute the Kelvin temperature for the recorded Antarctic winter temperature of -80°F. Express your final answer as an exact fraction in simplest form, providing only the numerical value without units.

### Solution
**Step 1: Derive Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C) conversion**  
The relationship is linear. Using the freezing point $(F_1, C_1) = (32, 0)$ and boiling point $(F_2, C_2) = (212, 100)$:  
$$C = mF + b$$  
Substitute point 1:  
$$0 = m \cdot 32 + b \implies b = -32m \quad (1)$$  
Substitute point 2:  
$$100 = m \cdot 212 + b \quad (2)$$  
Insert (1) into (2):  
$$100 = 212m - 32m \implies 100 = 180m \implies m = \frac{100}{180} = \frac{5}{9}$$  
Solve for $b$:  
$$b = -32 \cdot \frac{5}{9} = -\frac{160}{9}$$  
Thus:  
$$C = \frac{5}{9}F - \frac{160}{9} = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)$$  

**Step 2: Derive Celsius (°C) to Kelvin (K) conversion**  
Absolute zero is defined as $-273.15^\circ \text{C} = 0  \text{K}$, with equal degree sizes:  
$$K = C + 273.15$$  

**Step 3: Compose Fahrenheit to Kelvin conversion**  
Substitute the Celsius conversion:  
$$K = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) + 273.15$$  

**Step 4: Substitute $F = -80$ and simplify**  
Compute $F - 32$:  
$$-80 - 32 = -112$$  
Apply conversion:  
$$K = \frac{5}{9}(-112) + 273.15 = -\frac{560}{9} + 273.15$$  
Convert $273.15$ to fraction:  
$$273.15 = \frac{27315}{100} = \frac{5463}{20}$$  
Common denominator (180):  
$$K = -\frac{560}{9} + \frac{5463}{20} = \frac{-560 \cdot 20}{180} + \frac{5463 \cdot 9}{180} = \frac{-11200 + 49167}{180} = \frac{37967}{180}$$  
The fraction $\frac{37967}{180}$ is in simplest form (no common factors between 37967 and 180).

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{37967}{180}}$$

### Problem 28
##### Background
The Curie temperature is the critical temperature above which a ferromagnetic material loses its permanent magnetic properties. For iron, this temperature is a fixed value denoted as $T_{\text{Curie}}$ kelvin (K). Temperature scales are defined using specific reference points: the Kelvin scale uses absolute zero and the triple point of water, while the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales use the freezing and boiling points of water. The freezing point of water is defined as 0°C (273.15 K) and 32°F, and the boiling point is 100°C (373.15 K) and 212°F. The relationship between these scales is linear.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Derivation of linear conversion formulas between temperature scales (Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit).
- Application of algebraic methods to solve for coefficients in linear equations.
- Understanding of reference points in temperature scale definitions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications

- International scientific collaboration requiring temperature conversions.
- Climate science and environmental monitoring with multi-scale instrumentation.

##### Problem Statement
Derive the general formula to convert a temperature $T$ in kelvin to degrees Fahrenheit, $F$, using the following reference points:  
- Freezing point of water: $T = 273.15  \text{K}$, $F = 32$  
- Boiling point of water: $T = 373.15  \text{K}$, $F = 212$  

Express $F$ as a linear function of $T$: $F = aT + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants derived from the reference points.  
Then, express the Curie temperature of iron, $T_{\text{Curie}}$, in degrees Fahrenheit using this formula.  
Provide the final expression for $F_{\text{Curie}}$ in terms of $T_{\text{Curie}}$.

### Solution
The conversion from Kelvin to Fahrenheit is linear, so we assume:  
$$ F = aT + b $$  
where $T$ is in kelvin, $F$ is in degrees Fahrenheit, and $a$ and $b$ are constants.  

We use the two reference points to set up a system of equations.  

**First reference point (freezing point of water):**  
$T = 273.15$, $F = 32$  
$$ 32 = a \cdot 273.15 + b \quad \text{(Equation 1)} $$  

**Second reference point (boiling point of water):**  
$T = 373.15$, $F = 212$  
$$ 212 = a \cdot 373.15 + b \quad \text{(Equation 2)} $$  

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate $b$:  
$$ 212 - 32 = a \cdot 373.15 + b - (a \cdot 273.15 + b) $$  
$$ 180 = a (373.15 - 273.15) $$  
$$ 180 = a \cdot 100 $$  
Solve for $a$:  
$$ a = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $$  

Substitute $a = \frac{9}{5}$ into Equation 1 to solve for $b$:  
$$ 32 = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 273.15 + b $$  
$$ b = 32 - \frac{9}{5} \cdot 273.15 $$  
Calculate the product:  
$$ \frac{9}{5} \cdot 273.15 = 9 \cdot 54.63 = 491.67 $$  
Thus,  
$$ b = 32 - 491.67 = -459.67 $$  

The general conversion formula is:  
$$ F = \frac{9}{5} T - 459.67 $$  

For the Curie temperature of iron, substitute $T = T_{\text{Curie}}$:  
$$ F_{\text{Curie}} = \frac{9}{5} T_{\text{Curie}} - 459.67 $$  
This expresses the Fahrenheit temperature in terms of $T_{\text{Curie}}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{9}{5} T_{\text{Curie}} - 459.67}$$

------
### Problem 29
##### Background
Temperature scales are essential tools in meteorology, engineering, and daily life. The Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) scales relate through a linear transformation. While absolute temperature conversions require an offset, temperature *changes* (fluctuations) follow a simpler relationship because the offset cancels out. This problem explores how a temperature fluctuation in Celsius converts to Fahrenheit.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Derivation of conversion formulas for temperature *changes*  
3. Algebraic manipulation of linear equations  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Meteorology**: Daily temperature fluctuations impact weather forecasting and climate modeling.  
- **Materials Science**: Thermal expansion coefficients often require consistent temperature-change units across scales.  
- **Energy Efficiency**: HVAC systems must account for temperature swings in different measurement systems.

- Agricultural frost protection systems  
- Building insulation requirements  
- Battery performance in electric vehicles  
- Thermal stress on infrastructure  

##### Problem Statement
The Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion for an absolute temperature $T_C$ is given by:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32 $$  
where $T_F$ is the temperature in Fahrenheit.  

A weather station records a daily temperature fluctuation of $\Delta T_C = 15$°C. Derive a general expression for the equivalent temperature fluctuation $\Delta T_F$ in Fahrenheit, *solely in terms of $\Delta T_C$*. Then compute $\Delta T_F$ for $\Delta T_C = 15$°C.  

Express your final answer as a real number without units.

### Solution
**Step 1: Define temperature fluctuations**  
Let $T_{C,1}$ and $T_{C,2}$ be two Celsius temperatures, with fluctuation $\Delta T_C = T_{C,2} - T_{C,1} = 15$°C.  
The corresponding Fahrenheit temperatures are:  
$$ T_{F,1} = \frac{9}{5}T_{C,1} + 32 $$  
$$ T_{F,2} = \frac{9}{5}T_{C,2} + 32 $$  

**Step 2: Express the Fahrenheit fluctuation**  
The fluctuation in Fahrenheit is:  
$$ \Delta T_F = T_{F,2} - T_{F,1} = \left( \frac{9}{5}T_{C,2} + 32 \right) - \left( \frac{9}{5}T_{C,1} + 32 \right) $$  

**Step 3: Simplify the expression**  
$$ \Delta T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_{C,2} + 32 - \frac{9}{5}T_{C,1} - 32 = \frac{9}{5}(T_{C,2} - T_{C,1}) $$  
Since $T_{C,2} - T_{C,1} = \Delta T_C$, this becomes:  
$$ \Delta T_F = \frac{9}{5} \Delta T_C $$  

**Step 4: Compute the numerical value**  
Substitute $\Delta T_C = 15$:  
$$ \Delta T_F = \frac{9}{5} \times 15 = 9 \times 3 = 27 $$  

The temperature fluctuation in Fahrenheit is 27 degrees.

### Problem 3
##### Background  
Temperature scales are essential tools in science and daily life. The Fahrenheit (°F) scale is commonly used in the United States for weather reports and medical measurements, while the Kelvin (K) scale is the SI base unit for thermodynamic temperature, crucial in physics and engineering due to its absolute zero reference. The relationship between these scales is linear but requires deriving from fundamental fixed points: the freezing and boiling points of water.  

##### Knowledge Points Tested  
1. Derivation of linear conversion formulas between temperature scales.  
2. Application of the two-point slope formula to establish scale relationships.  
3. Algebraic manipulation to express one variable in terms of another.  
4. Precision in handling decimal values and unit conversions.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections  
This problem connects to thermodynamics (absolute zero), calorimetry (phase transitions of water), and measurement uncertainty (precision in medical diagnostics).  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections  
- **Physics**: Thermodynamic laws and gas behavior rely on absolute temperature.  
- **Meteorology**: Cross-scale temperature analysis for climate modeling.  
- **Medicine**: Body temperature monitoring in clinical settings.  

##### Real-World Applications  
- Calibrating scientific instruments (e.g., cryogenics at 0 K).  
- Converting medical data (e.g., body temperature) for international research.  
- Engineering systems (e.g., thermal sensors in aerospace).  

##### Problem Statement  
A biomedical device measures human body temperature as $T_{\text{F}} = 98.6$°F. To integrate this data into a thermodynamics model, convert $T_{\text{F}}$ to Kelvin (K) using the defining fixed points of the Fahrenheit and Kelvin scales:  
- Freezing point of water: $32$°F ≡ $273.15$ K  
- Boiling point of water: $212$°F ≡ $373.15$ K  
Both scales exhibit a linear relationship. Derive a general conversion formula from Fahrenheit to Kelvin, then compute the Kelvin equivalent of $98.6$°F. Express the final answer as a decimal number with two decimal places.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Establish the linear relationship  
Let $T_{\text{K}}$ be temperature in Kelvin and $T_{\text{F}}$ in Fahrenheit. The linear equation is:  
$$ T_{\text{K}} = m \cdot T_{\text{F}} + b $$  
where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $T_{\text{K}}$-intercept.  

##### Step 2: Apply fixed points to form equations  
Using the freezing point $(T_{\text{F}}, T_{\text{K}}) = (32, 273.15)$:  
$$ 273.15 = m \cdot 32 + b \quad \text{(Equation 1)} $$  
Using the boiling point $(T_{\text{F}}, T_{\text{K}}) = (212, 373.15)$:  
$$ 373.15 = m \cdot 212 + b \quad \text{(Equation 2)} $$  

##### Step 3: Solve for the slope $m$  
Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:  
$$ (373.15 - 273.15) = m \cdot (212 - 32) $$  
$$ 100 = m \cdot 180 $$  
$$ m = \frac{100}{180} = \frac{5}{9} $$  

##### Step 4: Solve for the intercept $b$  
Substitute $m = \frac{5}{9}$ into Equation 1:  
$$ 273.15 = \frac{5}{9} \cdot 32 + b $$  
$$ b = 273.15 - \frac{5}{9} \cdot 32 $$  
Compute $\frac{5}{9} \cdot 32$:  
$$ \frac{5}{9} \cdot 32 = \frac{160}{9} \approx 17.7778 $$  
$$ b = 273.15 - 17.7778 = 255.3722 $$  

##### Step 5: Derive the general conversion formula  
$$ T_{\text{K}} = \frac{5}{9} \cdot T_{\text{F}} + 255.3722 $$  
*Note: $255.3722$ is exact; retain full precision for computation.*  

##### Step 6: Apply to $T_{\text{F}} = 98.6$°F  
$$ T_{\text{K}} = \frac{5}{9} \cdot 98.6 + 255.3722 $$  
First, compute $\frac{5}{9} \cdot 98.6$:  
$$ \frac{5}{9} \cdot 98.6 = \frac{493}{9} = 54.\overline{777}... \approx 54.7778 $$  
Then:  
$$ T_{\text{K}} = 54.7778 + 255.3722 = 310.15 $$  
The value $310.15$ is exact, as $\frac{5}{9} \cdot 98.6 = \frac{5}{9} \cdot \frac{986}{10} = \frac{4930}{90} = \frac{493}{9}$, and $\frac{493}{9} + 255.3722 = 310.15$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{310.15}$$

The Kelvin scale (K) is an absolute thermodynamic scale where 0 K represents absolute zero, and its degree size matches the Celsius degree. 

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Derivation of the linear relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales using two reference points.
2. Conversion between Celsius and Kelvin scales.
3. Application of derived formulas to compute specific values.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Temperature conversions are vital in meteorology (weather reporting), engineering (material properties), and chemistry (reaction conditions), where data from international sources may use different scales.

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate temperature conversion is crucial for cryogenic storage (e.g., preserving biological samples at alcohol's freezing point) and industrial processes (e.g., calibrating sensors in petroleum refining).

##### Problem Statement
(a) Derive the general formula to convert temperature from degrees Celsius (°C) to degrees Fahrenheit (°F) by establishing a linear relationship $ T_F = a \cdot T_C + b $. Use the reference points:  
- Freezing point of water: $ T_C = 0 $, $ T_F = 32 $  
- Boiling point of water: $ T_C = 100 $, $ T_F = 212 $.  
Solve for constants $ a $ and $ b $, and express $ T_F $ explicitly in terms of $ T_C $.

- Do not include units.  
- For °F, round to one decimal place. For K, provide the exact value.

### Solution
##### Solution

##### (a) Derivation of $ T_F $ in terms of $ T_C $
Assume a linear relationship:  
$$ T_F = a \cdot T_C + b $$  

Using the freezing point of water ($ T_C = 0 $, $ T_F = 32 $):  
$$ 32 = a \cdot 0 + b \implies b = 32 $$  

Using the boiling point of water ($ T_C = 100 $, $ T_F = 212 $):  
$$ 212 = a \cdot 100 + 32 $$  
$$ 212 - 32 = 100a $$  
$$ 180 = 100a $$  
$$ a = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $$  

Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_C + 32 $$  

##### (b) Derivation of $ T_K $ in terms of $ T_C $
The Kelvin scale is defined such that $ 0 \, \text{K} = -273.15^\circ \text{C} $, and the size of one Kelvin degree equals one Celsius degree. Therefore:  
$$ T_K = T_C + 273.15 $$  

##### (c) Computation for $ T_C = -114 $
- **Fahrenheit ($ T_F $)**:  
  $$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot (-114) + 32 $$  
  $$ T_F = \frac{9 \cdot (-114)}{5} + 32 = \frac{-1026}{5} + 32 = -205.2 + 32 = -173.2 $$  
  Rounded to one decimal place: $ T_F = -173.2 $.  

- **Kelvin ($ T_K $)**:  
  $$ T_K = -114 + 273.15 = 159.15 $$  
  Exact value: $ T_K = 159.15 $.  

The temperature in Fahrenheit is $ -173.2 $ and in Kelvin is $ 159.15 $.

### Answer
$$\boxed{-173.2}$$

### Problem 31
##### Background
In thermodynamics and various scientific fields, temperature changes are often analyzed using different scales. The Fahrenheit scale is commonly used in the United States for everyday temperatures, while the Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale used extensively in physics and chemistry. Understanding how temperature differences convert between these scales is crucial for experiments involving heat transfer, chemical reactions, and climate studies. This problem explores the relationship between temperature changes in Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Conversion between Fahrenheit and Kelvin scales.
2. Derivation of temperature difference relationships.
3. Linear transformation properties of temperature scales.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to thermodynamics (heat transfer calculations), chemistry (reaction kinetics dependent on temperature changes), and instrumentation (calibration of temperature sensors across scales).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Thermal stress analysis in materials requires consistent temperature difference units.
- **Meteorology**: Climate models compare temperature anomalies across regions using different scales.
- **Medicine**: Hyperthermia treatments monitor temperature rises in different unit systems.

##### Real-World Applications

- Interpreting data from international spacecraft that report thermal fluctuations in Kelvin while ground systems use Fahrenheit.
- Analyzing thermal expansion in bridge joints where construction specs use Fahrenheit but material science models use Kelvin.

##### Problem Statement
The relationship between Fahrenheit (°F) and Kelvin (K) for a specific temperature $T$ is given by:
$$ K = \frac{5}{9}(T_F - 32) + 273.15 $$
where $T_F$ is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.  

A chemical reaction requires a temperature increase of $\Delta T_F$°F. Derive a general expression for the equivalent temperature increase $\Delta T_K$ in Kelvin, solely in terms of $\Delta T_F$. Then, compute $\Delta T_K$ for $\Delta T_F = 25$°F.  

Express $\Delta T_K$ as an exact fraction first, then as a decimal rounded to three significant figures. Provide only the numerical value (without units) for the decimal result in your final answer.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Analyze temperature differences
Consider two temperatures in Fahrenheit: $T_{F1}$ and $T_{F2} = T_{F1} + \Delta T_F$.  
Their corresponding Kelvin values are:  
$$ K_1 = \frac{5}{9}(T_{F1} - 32) + 273.15 $$  
$$ K_2 = \frac{5}{9}(T_{F2} - 32) + 273.15 = \frac{5}{9}((T_{F1} + \Delta T_F) - 32) + 273.15 $$  

##### Step 2: Compute $\Delta T_K$
The temperature difference in Kelvin is:  
$$ \Delta T_K = K_2 - K_1 $$  
Substitute the expressions:  
$$ \Delta T_K = \left[ \frac{5}{9}(T_{F1} + \Delta T_F - 32) + 273.15 \right] - \left[ \frac{5}{9}(T_{F1} - 32) + 273.15 \right] $$  

##### Step 3: Simplify the expression
Expand and cancel terms:  
$$ \Delta T_K = \frac{5}{9}(T_{F1} + \Delta T_F - 32) + 273.15 - \frac{5}{9}(T_{F1} - 32) - 273.15 $$  
$$ \Delta T_K = \frac{5}{9}T_{F1} + \frac{5}{9}\Delta T_F - \frac{5}{9} \cdot 32 + 273.15 - \frac{5}{9}T_{F1} + \frac{5}{9} \cdot 32 - 273.15 $$  
The terms $\frac{5}{9}T_{F1}$, $-\frac{5}{9} \cdot 32$, $+\frac{5}{9} \cdot 32$, $+273.15$, and $-273.15$ cancel out, leaving:  
$$ \Delta T_K = \frac{5}{9}\Delta T_F $$  

##### Step 4: Apply to given value
For $\Delta T_F = 25$°F:  
$$ \Delta T_K = \frac{5}{9} \times 25 = \frac{125}{9} $$  
As a decimal: $\frac{125}{9} \approx 13.888...$  

##### Step 5: Rounding
Rounded to three significant figures: $13.9$ (since $13.888...$ rounded to the nearest $0.1$ is $13.9$).

### Answer
$$\boxed{13.9}$$

The Kelvin scale uses the same degree size as Celsius but sets absolute zero at 0 K, with water freezing at 273.15 K. The Fahrenheit scale sets water's freezing point at 32°F and boiling point at 212°F. Temperature conversions rely on linear relationships between these scales.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

- Rounding instructions: Final answer must be rounded to one decimal place.

### Solution
##### Part (a): Derivation of $T_K$ as a function of $T_C$
The Celsius and Kelvin scales share the same unit size but have different zero points. Absolute zero (0 K) corresponds to $-273.15$°C, and the freezing point of water is $273.15$ K (0°C). This implies a linear relationship:  
$$T_K = T_C + \Delta$$  
where $\Delta$ is the offset. Using the freezing point of water as a reference:  
When $T_C = 0$, $T_K = 273.15$. Substituting these values:  
$$273.15 = 0 + \Delta \implies \Delta = 273.15$$  
Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$T_K = T_C + 273.15$$  

##### Part (b): Derivation of $T_F$ as a function of $T_C$
The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales have different unit sizes and zero points. A linear relationship is assumed:  
$$T_F = \alpha T_C + \beta$$  
where $\alpha$ is the slope and $\beta$ is the intercept. Use the two reference points:  
1. Freezing point of water: $T_C = 0$ → $T_F = 32$  
2. Boiling point of water: $T_C = 100$ → $T_F = 212$  

**First equation (freezing point):**  
$$32 = \alpha \cdot 0 + \beta \implies \beta = 32$$  

**Second equation (boiling point):**  
$$212 = \alpha \cdot 100 + 32$$  
Solve for $\alpha$:  
$$212 - 32 = 100\alpha \implies 180 = 100\alpha \implies \alpha = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5}$$  
Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_C + 32$$  

##### Part (c): Conversion of $-229^\circ\text{C}$ to Fahrenheit
Using the formula from part (b):  
$$T_F = \frac{9}{5}(-229) + 32$$  
Calculate step by step:  
1. Multiply by $\frac{9}{5}$:  
   $$\frac{9}{5} \times (-229) = 9 \times (-45.8) = -412.2$$  
2. Add 32:  
   $$-412.2 + 32 = -380.2$$  
Rounded to one decimal place: $-380.2$  

**Final answer for $T_F$:** $-380.2$

The Kelvin scale (K) is an absolute thermodynamic scale where 0 K is absolute zero and the triple point of water is defined as 273.16 K. For practical conversions, the freezing point of water is 273.15 K.

##### Problem Statement
The normal human body temperature is 310 K.  
1. Derive the general conversion formula from Kelvin to Celsius.  
2. Derive the general conversion formula from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  
3. Using these formulas, derive a general expression for $ T_F - T_C $ (difference between Fahrenheit and Celsius readings) in terms of $ T_K $.  
4. Compute $ T_F - T_C $ for 310 K. Express the final answer as a decimal number.

### Solution
**Part 1: Derive Kelvin to Celsius formula**  
The freezing point of water provides a reference:  
- Kelvin: 273.15 K  
- Celsius: 0°C  

Since a 1 K change equals a 1°C change:  
$$ T_C = T_K - 273.15 $$  

**Part 2: Derive Celsius to Fahrenheit formula**  
Using the freezing and boiling points of water:  
- Freezing: $ T_C = 0 $, $ T_F = 32 $  
- Boiling: $ T_C = 100 $, $ T_F = 212 $  

The linear relationship is $ T_F = a \cdot T_C + b $.  
Substitute freezing point:  
$$ 32 = a \cdot 0 + b \implies b = 32 $$  
Substitute boiling point:  
$$ 212 = a \cdot 100 + 32 \implies 100a = 180 \implies a = \frac{9}{5} $$  
Thus:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} T_C + 32 $$  

**Part 3: Derive $ T_F - T_C $ in terms of $ T_K $**  
From Part 1:  
$$ T_C = T_K - 273.15 $$  
From Part 2:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} (T_K - 273.15) + 32 $$  
Compute the difference:  
$$ T_F - T_C = \left[ \frac{9}{5} (T_K - 273.15) + 32 \right] - (T_K - 273.15) $$  
Simplify:  
$$ = \frac{9}{5} (T_K - 273.15) - (T_K - 273.15) + 32 $$  
$$ = \left( \frac{9}{5} - 1 \right) (T_K - 273.15) + 32 $$  
$$ = \frac{4}{5} (T_K - 273.15) + 32 $$  

**Part 4: Compute for $ T_K = 310 $**  
Substitute into the derived expression:  
$$ T_F - T_C = \frac{4}{5} (310 - 273.15) + 32 $$  
Calculate inside parentheses:  
$$ 310 - 273.15 = 36.85 $$  
Multiply:  
$$ \frac{4}{5} \times 36.85 = 29.48 $$  
Add:  
$$ 29.48 + 32 = 61.48 $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{61.48}$$

### Problem 34
##### Background
Temperature scales are defined using fixed reference points. The Celsius scale sets the freezing point of water at 0°C and the boiling point at 100°C. The Fahrenheit scale uses 32°F for freezing and 212°F for boiling. The Kelvin scale is absolute, with 0 K at absolute zero and 273.15 K at the freezing point of water. Absolute zero corresponds to -273.15°C. A linear relationship exists between these scales. The ignition temperature of paper is 233°C, a critical value in fire safety and material science.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Deriving linear conversion formulas between temperature scales using fixed points.  
2. Applying algebraic techniques to solve systems of equations.  
3. Understanding thermodynamic principles underlying absolute temperature scales.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects thermodynamics (absolute zero) with algebra (linear equations) and measurement science (scale calibration). It reinforces the concept that temperature scales are linear transformations of each other.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Chemistry**: Ignition temperatures determine combustion reactions.  
- **Engineering**: Material safety limits rely on accurate temperature conversions.  
- **Data Science**: Unit conversion algorithms are foundational in sensor data processing.  

##### Real-World Applications

- Setting safety thresholds in industrial processes (e.g., paper manufacturing).  
- Interpreting thermal data from scientific instruments using different scales.  

##### Problem Statement
Derive general conversion formulas:  
a) From Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F) using freezing point $T_{C,f} = 0^\circ \text{C}$, boiling point $T_{C,b} = 100^\circ \text{C}$, $T_{F,f} = 32^\circ \text{F}$, and $T_{F,b} = 212^\circ \text{F}$.  
b) From Celsius to Kelvin (K) using absolute zero $T_{C,\text{abs}} = -273.15^\circ \text{C}$.  
c) Apply these formulas to convert the ignition temperature of paper, $T_{\text{ign}} = 233^\circ \text{C}$, to °F and K.  
Express all final numerical values rounded to one decimal place.

### Solution
##### Step-by-Step Derivation

##### Part (a): Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion
Assume a linear relationship:  
$$ T_F = m T_C + b $$  
Using the freezing and boiling points:  
1. At freezing: $ T_C = 0 $, $ T_F = 32 $  
   $$ 32 = m \cdot 0 + b \implies b = 32 $$  
2. At boiling: $ T_C = 100 $, $ T_F = 212 $  
   $$ 212 = m \cdot 100 + 32 $$  
   Solve for $m$:  
   $$ 212 - 32 = 100m \implies 180 = 100m \implies m = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} = 1.8 $$  
Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$ T_F = 1.8 T_C + 32 $$  

##### Part (b): Celsius to Kelvin Conversion
The Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero:  
- Absolute zero: $ T_C = -273.15 $ corresponds to $ T_K = 0 $.  
- The size of 1 K equals 1°C.  
Thus, the conversion is a vertical shift:  
$$ T_K = T_C - (-273.15) = T_C + 273.15 $$  

##### Part (c): Convert Ignition Temperature
Given $ T_{\text{ign}} = 233^\circ \text{C} $:  
- **Fahrenheit**:  
  $$ T_F = 1.8 \cdot 233 + 32 = 419.4 + 32 = 451.4^\circ \text{F} $$  
- **Kelvin**:  
  $$ T_K = 233 + 273.15 = 506.15 \approx 506.2 \, \text{K} \quad \text{(rounded to one decimal place)} $$

### Problem 4
##### Background
In the early 18th century, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit and Anders Celsius developed temperature scales based on the properties of water. Fahrenheit defined water's freezing point as 32°F and boiling point as 212°F, while Celsius defined freezing as 0°C and boiling as 100°C. Both scales are linear, but use different zero points and unit sizes. During a calibration check, a lab technician observes that at a specific temperature, a Celsius thermometer and a Fahrenheit thermometer display identical numerical readings.

##### Problem Statement
Using only the fundamental reference points of water's freezing and boiling points:  
- Derive the general linear equation converting Celsius temperature $T_C$ to Fahrenheit temperature $T_F$  
- Determine the specific Celsius temperature where $T_C = T_F$  
- Provide your final answer as a numerical value without units (implied unit: degrees Celsius)  

*Constraints:*  
- Start from first principles using the reference points  
- Do not assume or use standard conversion formulas  
- Express all coefficients as simplified fractions

### Solution
**Step 1: Establish reference points**  
Define known pairs $(T_C, T_F)$:  
- Freezing point: $(0, 32)$  
- Boiling point: $(100, 212)$  

**Step 2: Derive conversion equation**  
Assume linear relationship: $T_F = aT_C + b$  
Substitute freezing point:  
$32 = a \cdot 0 + b \implies b = 32$  

Substitute boiling point:  
$212 = a \cdot 100 + 32$  
$212 - 32 = 100a$  
$180 = 100a$  
$a = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5}$  

Conversion equation:  
$$T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32$$  

**Step 3: Set temperatures equal**  
Require $T_C = T_F$:  
$$T_C = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32$$  

**Step 4: Solve for $T_C$**  
Isolate $T_C$ terms:  
$T_C - \frac{9}{5}T_C = 32$  
$\frac{5}{5}T_C - \frac{9}{5}T_C = 32$  
$-\frac{4}{5}T_C = 32$  

Multiply both sides by $-\frac{5}{4}$:  
$T_C = 32 \cdot \left(-\frac{5}{4}\right)$  
$T_C = -40$  

**Verification**  
Substitute $T_C = -40$ into conversion equation:  
$T_F = \frac{9}{5}(-40) + 32 = -72 + 32 = -40$  
Confirms $T_C = T_F = -40$

### Answer

### Problem 5
##### Background
Temperature scales are defined by fixed reference points. The Kelvin (K) scale is an absolute thermodynamic scale where 0 K represents absolute zero. The Fahrenheit (°F) scale uses the freezing point of a brine solution at 0 °F and the average human body temperature at 96 °F in its original definition, but modern standards define the freezing point of water at 32 °F and the boiling point at 212 °F. Absolute zero is experimentally determined to be -459.67 °F. 

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Linear relationship between temperature scales.  
2. Derivation of conversion formulas using reference points.  
3. Algebraic manipulation of linear equations.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to the concept of linear functions in algebra and the physical interpretation of temperature as a measurable quantity in thermodynamics.  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Temperature conversions are essential in meteorology (weather reporting), engineering (material properties), and culinary science (international recipes).  

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate temperature conversion is critical when handling cryogenic substances like liquid nitrogen, which boils at 77 K. This is used in medical preservation, superconductivity research, and aerospace engineering.  

##### Problem Statement
Using the following reference points:  
- Absolute zero: $ (T_K, T_F) = (0 \, \text{K}, -459.67 \, \text{°F}) $  
- Freezing point of water: $ (T_K, T_F) = (273.15 \, \text{K}, 32 \, \text{°F}) $  

Derive the general linear equation to convert a temperature $ T_K $ in Kelvin to $ T_F $ in Fahrenheit. Then, apply this equation to find the Fahrenheit equivalent of the boiling point of nitrogen, given as 77 K.  

Express your final answer as an exact decimal number. Provide only the numerical value (without units).

### Solution
##### Step 1: Model the linear relationship  
The conversion between Kelvin and Fahrenheit is linear:  
$$ T_F = m \cdot T_K + b $$  
where $ m $ is the slope and $ b $ is the y-intercept.  

##### Step 2: Determine the slope $ m $ using reference points  
The slope $ m $ is calculated as:  
$$ m = \frac{\Delta T_F}{\Delta T_K} = \frac{T_{F_2} - T_{F_1}}{T_{K_2} - T_{K_1}} $$  
Substitute the freezing point $(T_{K_2}, T_{F_2}) = (273.15, 32)$ and absolute zero $(T_{K_1}, T_{F_1}) = (0, -459.67)$:  
$$ m = \frac{32 - (-459.67)}{273.15 - 0} = \frac{491.67}{273.15} $$  

##### Step 3: Simplify the slope  
Notice that:  
$$ 491.67 = \frac{9}{5} \times 273.15 \quad \text{(since } \frac{9}{5} \times 273.15 = 491.67\text{)} $$  
Thus:  
$$ m = \frac{9/5 \times 273.15}{273.15} = \frac{9}{5} $$  

##### Step 4: Determine the y-intercept $ b $  
Use absolute zero point $(T_K, T_F) = (0, -459.67)$:  
$$ -459.67 = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 0 + b \implies b = -459.67 $$  

##### Step 5: Write the general conversion equation  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot T_K - 459.67 $$  

##### Step 6: Apply to boiling point of nitrogen  
Substitute $ T_K = 77 $:  
$$ T_F = \frac{9}{5} \cdot 77 - 459.67 $$  
First, compute $ \frac{9}{5} \times 77 $:  
$$ \frac{9}{5} \times 77 = \frac{693}{5} = 138.6 $$  
Then:  
$$ T_F = 138.6 - 459.67 = -321.07 $$  

The boiling point of nitrogen is $-321.07 \, \text{°F}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{-321.07}$$

### Problem 6
##### Background
Temperature scales are essential tools in science, engineering, and daily life for quantifying thermal energy. The Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) scales are two commonly used systems, defined by specific fixed points: the freezing point of water is 0°C or 32°F, and the boiling point is 100°C or 212°F. Both scales are linear, meaning equal temperature intervals correspond to proportional changes in scale readings. Understanding how to convert differences between these scales requires analyzing their linear relationship.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Derivation of linear relationships between temperature scales.
- Conversion of temperature differences (independent of reference points).
- Algebraic manipulation of linear equations.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to linear functions in algebra (slope-intercept form) and calibration of measurement instruments in experimental physics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
**Meteorology**: Temperature differences drive weather patterns, wind formation, and heat transfer. **Materials Science**: Thermal expansion coefficients rely on precise temperature differences. **Culinary Science**: Recipe adjustments require consistent temperature conversions.

##### Real-World Applications
- Climate researchers compare temperature anomalies (e.g., 30°F Arctic warming) across international datasets using Celsius.
- Aerospace engineers convert thermal stress differences in aircraft components between imperial and metric systems.

##### Problem Statement
The Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) temperature scales are linearly related. Using the fundamental definitions:  
- Freezing point of water: 0°C = 32°F  
- Boiling point of water: 100°C = 212°F  

Derive a general expression for converting a temperature difference from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Then, apply this expression to compute the Celsius equivalent of a 30°F temperature difference. Express the final answer as an exact fraction.

### Solution
The linear relationship between Celsius ($C$) and Fahrenheit ($F$) is:  

$$ F = aC + b $$
  
where $a$ and $b$ are constants.  

**Step 1: Find $b$ using the freezing point**  
At the freezing point:  

$$ 32 = a \cdot 0 + b \implies b = 32 $$
  

**Step 2: Find $a$ using the boiling point**  
At the boiling point:  

$$ 212 = a \cdot 100 + 32 $$
  

$$ 212 - 32 = 100a $$
  

$$ 180 = 100a $$
  

$$ a = \frac{180}{100} = \frac{9}{5} $$
  
Thus, the conversion equation is:  

$$ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $$
  

**Step 3: Derive the difference conversion**  
Consider two temperatures $F_1$ and $F_2$ in Fahrenheit, with difference $\Delta F = F_1 - F_2$. The corresponding Celsius temperatures are $C_1$ and $C_2$, with difference $\Delta C = C_1 - C_2$. From the linear equation:  

$$ F_1 = \frac{9}{5}C_1 + 32 $$
  

$$ F_2 = \frac{9}{5}C_2 + 32 $$
  
Subtract these equations:  

$$ F_1 - F_2 = \left( \frac{9}{5}C_1 + 32 \right) - \left( \frac{9}{5}C_2 + 32 \right) $$
  

$$ \Delta F = \frac{9}{5}(C_1 - C_2) + (32 - 32) $$
  

$$ \Delta F = \frac{9}{5} \Delta C $$
  
Solving for $\Delta C$:  

$$ \Delta C = \frac{5}{9} \Delta F $$
  

**Step 4: Apply to $\Delta F = 30$**  

$$ \Delta C = \frac{5}{9} \cdot 30 = \frac{150}{9} = \frac{50}{3} $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{50}{3}}$$

### Problem 7
##### Background
Temperature scales are defined by fixed reference points. The Celsius scale sets 0°C as the freezing point of water and 100°C as the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. The Fahrenheit scale sets 32°F as the freezing point and 212°F as the boiling point. The Kelvin scale is an absolute thermodynamic scale where 0 K represents absolute zero, and the triple point of water is defined as 273.16 K (equivalent to 0.01°C). A unique temperature exists where the numerical values on the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales coincide, which is relevant for instrument calibration and scientific applications.

##### Problem Statement
Derive the unique temperature where the numerical reading on a Celsius thermometer equals the reading on a Fahrenheit thermometer. Using this Celsius temperature, determine the corresponding Kelvin temperature through scale conversion. Express the final Kelvin temperature as an exact number.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Establish the Celsius-Fahrenheit conversion formula
The linear relationship between Celsius ($C$) and Fahrenheit ($F$) is derived from the reference points:
- Freezing point: $C=0$, $F=32$
- Boiling point: $C=100$, $F=212$

The conversion formula is:
$$ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $$

##### Step 2: Set up the equivalence condition
At the unique temperature where $C = F$, substitute $F$ with $C$:
$$ C = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 $$

##### Step 3: Solve for the Celsius temperature
Rearrange the equation:
$$ C - \frac{9}{5}C = 32 $$
$$ \frac{5C - 9C}{5} = 32 $$
$$ -\frac{4}{5}C = 32 $$
Multiply both sides by $-\frac{5}{4}$:
$$ C = 32 \times \left(-\frac{5}{4}\right) = -40 $$
Thus, the temperature is $-40$°C (which is equivalently $-40$°F).

##### Step 4: Convert to Kelvin
The Kelvin ($K$) scale relates to Celsius by:
$$ K = C + 273.15 $$
Substitute $C = -40$:
$$ K = -40 + 273.15 = 233.15 $$
The value $273.15$ is defined as the exact offset between the Celsius and Kelvin scales at standard conditions.

##### Conclusion
The Kelvin temperature corresponding to $-40$°C is exactly $233.15$ K.

### Problem 8
##### Background
In materials science, understanding the melting points of metals in different temperature scales is crucial for applications like alloy design and industrial processing. The Fahrenheit (°F), Celsius (°C), and Kelvin (K) scales are defined using fixed reference points, primarily the freezing and boiling points of water. The Celsius scale sets water's freezing point at 0°C and boiling point at 100°C. The Fahrenheit scale sets these points at 32°F and 212°F. The Kelvin scale uses the same unit size as Celsius but starts at absolute zero, with the conversion $K = °C + 273.15$. A new high-strength alloy melts at 1760°F. 

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Derivation of linear temperature conversion formulas from fundamental fixed points.
2. Application of algebraic relationships to convert between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scales.
3. Handling exact constants and arithmetic expressions in unit conversions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to thermodynamics (absolute temperature), algebra (linear equations), and materials science (melting point analysis).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Physics**: Thermodynamic principles and absolute zero.
- **Engineering**: Temperature calibration in materials processing.
- **Chemistry**: Phase transitions and energy requirements for melting.

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate temperature conversion is vital in international scientific collaboration, aerospace engineering (e.g., heat shield design), and metallurgy (e.g., smelting processes where temperatures exceed 1000°C).

##### Problem Statement
Using the definitions of the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales based on the freezing and boiling points of water, derive the general conversion formula from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. Apply this formula to find the Celsius equivalent of the alloy's melting point at 1760°F. Then, convert this result to Kelvin using the standard offset. Express the melting point in Kelvin as your final answer.  
**Format Requirements**:  
- Derive all formulas symbolically using the fixed points.  
- For the final answer, provide an exact numerical value in Kelvin (no units in box).  
- Use decimals if needed; constants like 273.15 are exact.

### Solution
##### Step 1: Derive the Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion formula  
The relationship between Fahrenheit (°F) and Celsius (°C) is linear. Define two known points:  
- Freezing point of water: ($F_1$, $C_1$) = (32, 0)  
- Boiling point of water: ($F_2$, $C_2$) = (212, 100)  

The slope $m$ of the line is:  
$$ m = \frac{C_2 - C_1}{F_2 - F_1} = \frac{100 - 0}{212 - 32} = \frac{100}{180} = \frac{5}{9} $$  

Using the point-slope form with ($F_1$, $C_1$):  
$$ C - C_1 = m (F - F_1) $$  
$$ C - 0 = \frac{5}{9} (F - 32) $$  
Thus, the conversion formula is:  
$$ C = \frac{5}{9} (F - 32) $$  

##### Step 2: Convert 1760°F to Celsius  
Substitute $F = 1760$ into the derived formula:  
$$ C = \frac{5}{9} (1760 - 32) = \frac{5}{9} \times 1728 $$  
Simplify:  
$$ 1728 \div 9 = 192 \quad \text{(exact division)} $$  
$$ C = 5 \times 192 = 960 $$  
So, $C = 960$°C.  

##### Step 3: Convert Celsius to Kelvin  
The Kelvin scale relates to Celsius by:  
$$ K = C + 273.15 $$  
Substitute $C = 960$:  
$$ K = 960 + 273.15 = 1233.15 $$  
The value 1233.15 is exact, as 273.15 is a defined constant.  

**Final Answer**: The melting point in Kelvin is 1233.15.

### Answer
$$\boxed{1233.15}$$

### Problem 9
##### Background
The Celsius and Kelvin temperature scales are fundamental in scientific measurements. The Celsius scale sets the freezing point of water at 0°C and the boiling point at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure. The Kelvin scale, an absolute temperature scale, starts at absolute zero (the theoretical minimum temperature where molecular motion ceases). Absolute zero is experimentally determined to be -273.15°C, and the size of one Kelvin unit is identical to one Celsius degree. 

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Linear relationship between Celsius and Kelvin scales.
- Algebraic derivation of temperature conversions.
- Concept of absolute zero and its role in defining the Kelvin scale.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Thermodynamics: Absolute temperature underpins gas laws (e.g., Charles's Law: $ V \propto T_K $).
- Physical Chemistry: Phase transitions (e.g., boiling) depend on absolute temperature.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- Meteorology: Atmospheric models use Kelvin for stability calculations.
- Engineering: Thermodynamic cycles (e.g., Carnot engines) require absolute temperature inputs.

##### Real-World Applications
- Cryogenics: Storage of biological samples at ultra-low temperatures (e.g., -196°C for liquid nitrogen, or 77 K).
- Climate Science: Global temperature anomalies are tracked in Kelvin for precision.

##### Problem Statement
Let $ A $ denote the Celsius value of absolute zero (a negative constant). The Kelvin scale is defined such that:  
- Absolute zero corresponds to $ 0  \text{K} $.  
- A temperature interval of 1 K equals 1°C.  

Given the boiling point of water as $ T_c $ degrees Celsius, derive an expression for its Kelvin equivalent, $ T_k $, using $ T_c $ and $ A $.

### Solution
The relationship between Celsius ($ T_c $) and Kelvin ($ T_k $) is linear. Since 1 K = 1°C, the slope of the conversion line is 1. Thus, the general equation is:  
$$ T_k = T_c + b $$  
where $ b $ is a constant offset.  

Use the condition at absolute zero:  
- When $ T_c = A $, $ T_k = 0 $.  

Substitute these values into the equation:  
$$ 0 = A + b $$  
Solve for $ b $:  
$$ b = -A $$  

The conversion equation becomes:  
$$ T_k = T_c - A $$  

For the boiling point of water, substitute $ T_c $ (given):  
$$ T_k = T_c - A $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{T_c - A}$$

## uncertainty analysis and error propagation

### Problem 0
##### Background
In experimental physics and engineering, accurately determining material properties such as density requires careful measurement of mass and volume, each with inherent uncertainties. Density, defined as mass per unit volume, is a derived quantity whose uncertainty depends on the uncertainties of the measured mass and volume. Understanding how to propagate these uncertainties is essential for reliable scientific conclusions.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Definition of relative uncertainty.
2. Error propagation for a quotient of two independent variables.
3. Application of partial derivatives in uncertainty analysis.
4. Construction of the relative uncertainty formula from first principles.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to measurement techniques in mechanics (e.g., Archimedes' principle for volume determination).
- Extends to uncertainty analysis in other derived quantities (e.g., pressure, stress, concentration).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- Chemistry: Calculating concentration uncertainties in solutions.
- Materials Science: Determining porosity or purity of composites.
- Environmental Science: Estimating pollutant density in soil/water samples.

##### Real-World Applications
- Quality control in manufacturing: Verifying material density in aerospace components.
- Geology: Measuring rock density to infer mineral composition.
- Medical imaging: Calibrating density standards in computed tomography (CT) scans.

##### Problem Statement
A laboratory measures the mass of a sample as $m \pm \Delta m$ and its volume as $V \pm \Delta V$. The density $\rho$ is calculated using $\rho = m / V$.  
Derive the expression for the **relative uncertainty** in density, $\frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho}$, in terms of $m$, $\Delta m$, $V$, and $\Delta V$.  
Express your answer as a single analytic expression using the symbols $\Delta m$, $m$, $\Delta V$, and $V$.

### Solution
The relative uncertainty in density $\frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho}$ is derived using error propagation for the function $\rho(m, V) = m / V$. The general formula for the uncertainty $\Delta \rho$ is:
$$
(\Delta \rho)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial m} \Delta m \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial V} \Delta V \right)^2,
$$
since $m$ and $V$ are independent variables.

First, compute the partial derivatives:
$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial m} = \frac{\partial}{\partial m} \left( \frac{m}{V} \right) = \frac{1}{V},
$$
$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial}{\partial V} \left( \frac{m}{V} \right) = -\frac{m}{V^2}.
$$

Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:
$$
(\Delta \rho)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{V} \cdot \Delta m \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{m}{V^2} \cdot \Delta V \right)^2 = \frac{(\Delta m)^2}{V^2} + \frac{m^2 (\Delta V)^2}{V^4}.
$$

The relative uncertainty is $\frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho}$. Since $\rho = m / V$, we have:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right)^2 = \frac{(\Delta \rho)^2}{\rho^2} = \frac{ \frac{(\Delta m)^2}{V^2} + \frac{m^2 (\Delta V)^2}{V^4} }{ \left( \frac{m}{V} \right)^2 } = \frac{ \frac{(\Delta m)^2}{V^2} + \frac{m^2 (\Delta V)^2}{V^4} }{ \frac{m^2}{V^2} }.
$$

Simplify the expression:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{(\Delta m)^2}{V^2} + \frac{m^2 (\Delta V)^2}{V^4} \right) \cdot \frac{V^2}{m^2} = \frac{(\Delta m)^2}{m^2} + \frac{(\Delta V)^2}{V^2}.
$$

Thus, the relative uncertainty is:
$$
\frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 }.
$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 } }$$

### Problem 1
##### Background
In experimental physics and engineering, measuring physical dimensions with precision is crucial. Consider a rectangular plate whose length and width are measured using instruments with finite precision. The length is recorded as $l \pm \Delta l$, and the width as $w \pm \Delta w$, where $\Delta l$ and $\Delta w$ represent the absolute uncertainties in these measurements. The area $A$ of the rectangle is calculated as $A = lw$, but due to measurement uncertainties, the computed area also carries an uncertainty. 

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Propagation of uncertainty for multiplicative quantities
2. Partial derivatives in error analysis
3. Root-sum-square (RSS) method for independent uncertainties

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- **Calculus**: Application of partial derivatives to quantify sensitivity of a function to input variables
- **Probability**: RSS method relies on the assumption of independent, normally distributed errors

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Tolerance analysis in manufacturing and design
- **Meteorology**: Uncertainty in calculating surface areas for climate modeling
- **Economics**: Error propagation in revenue calculations ($\text{revenue} = \text{price} \times \text{quantity}$)

##### Real-World Applications
- Semiconductor fabrication: Calculating chip area uncertainties affects yield predictions
- Cartography: Determining land area errors from satellite measurements
- Material science: Estimating surface area of nanomaterials for catalytic activity

##### Problem Statement
A rectangular plate has length $l$ with absolute uncertainty $\Delta l$ and width $w$ with absolute uncertainty $\Delta w$. The uncertainties $\Delta l$ and $\Delta w$ are independent and random. Derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta A$ in the area $A = lw$. Express $\Delta A$ symbolically in terms of $l$, $w$, $\Delta l$, and $\Delta w$. Box your final answer as a single simplified expression.

### Solution
To find the absolute uncertainty $\Delta A$ in the area $A = lw$, we use the root-sum-square (RSS) method for error propagation. For a function $A(l, w)$, the absolute uncertainty is given by:

$$ \Delta A = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial A}{\partial l} \Delta l \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial A}{\partial w} \Delta w \right)^2 } $$

First, compute the partial derivatives of $A$ with respect to $l$ and $w$:

$$ \frac{\partial A}{\partial l} = \frac{\partial}{\partial l}(lw) = w $$
$$ \frac{\partial A}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial}{\partial w}(lw) = l $$

Substitute these derivatives into the RSS formula:

$$ \Delta A = \sqrt{ \left( w \cdot \Delta l \right)^2 + \left( l \cdot \Delta w \right)^2 } $$

Simplify the expression under the square root:

$$ \Delta A = \sqrt{ w^2 (\Delta l)^2 + l^2 (\Delta w)^2 } $$

This is the simplified expression for the absolute uncertainty in the area. The derivation assumes independent and random uncertainties in $l$ and $w$, which justifies the use of the RSS method.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ w^{2} (\Delta l)^{2} + l^{2} (\Delta w)^{2} }}$$

### Problem 10
##### Background
In scientific measurements, determining physical quantities often involves instruments with inherent precision limits. For instance, astronomers measuring the radius of a celestial body or engineers calibrating spherical components must account for measurement uncertainties. These uncertainties propagate to derived quantities, such as surface area, affecting subsequent calculations like material requirements or radiation flux estimates.

- Error propagation for functions of a single variable.
- Application of derivatives in uncertainty analysis.
- Simplification of symbolic expressions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to calculus (derivatives as sensitivity coefficients), algebra (manipulating symbolic fractions), and geometry (properties of spheres). It extends to experimental physics, where uncertainty quantification is essential for data validation.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Tolerance analysis in manufacturing spherical components.
- **Meteorology**: Estimating cloud or raindrop surface areas for climate models.
- **Medicine**: Calculating dosage delivery via spherical nanoparticles in targeted drug systems.

##### Real-World Applications
- Determining the minimal coating thickness for a spherical fuel tank when radius measurements have ±1% error.
- Calculating solar radiation absorption by exoplanets based on telescopic radius measurements with known instrument precision.

##### Problem Statement
The surface area $A$ of a sphere is given by $A = 4\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. Due to measurement limitations, the radius is reported as $r \pm \Delta r$, with $\Delta r$ denoting the absolute uncertainty in $r$. Derive a symbolic expression for the relative uncertainty in $A$. Express your answer solely in terms of $r$ and $\Delta r$, using a single fraction if applicable. Ensure all derivatives are explicitly calculated and simplified.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty in $A$, we start with its definition:  

$$
\text{Relative uncertainty in } A = \frac{\Delta A}{A},
$$
  
where $\Delta A$ is the absolute uncertainty in $A$. Since $A$ depends on $r$, we use error propagation for a function of one variable:  

$$
\Delta A \approx \left| \frac{dA}{dr} \right| \Delta r.
$$
  
First, compute the derivative of $A$ with respect to $r$:  

$$
\frac{dA}{dr} = \frac{d}{dr} (4\pi r^2) = 8\pi r.
$$
  
Thus, the absolute uncertainty in $A$ is:  

$$
\Delta A \approx |8\pi r| \Delta r = 8\pi r \Delta r \quad (\text{since } r > 0).
$$
  
Now substitute into the relative uncertainty formula:  

$$
\frac{\Delta A}{A} = \frac{8\pi r \Delta r}{4\pi r^2}.
$$
  
Simplify the expression:  

$$
\frac{8\pi r \Delta r}{4\pi r^2} = \frac{8}{4} \cdot \frac{\pi}{\pi} \cdot \frac{r}{r^2} \cdot \Delta r = 2 \cdot \frac{\Delta r}{r}.
$$
  
The relative uncertainty in $A$ is therefore $2 \frac{\Delta r}{r}$.

### Answer
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{2 \Delta r}{r}}

##### Background
In electronic circuit design, resistors are fundamental components used to control current flow. Manufacturing processes introduce tolerances in resistance values, often specified as a nominal resistance plus/minus an absolute uncertainty. When resistors are connected in series, their resistances add, but the uncertainties propagate according to the principles of error analysis. Understanding how to quantify the resulting uncertainty is crucial for designing reliable circuits.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to the statistical treatment of measurement errors in physics, the derivation of uncertainty formulas for other operations (e.g., products or quotients), and the application of multivariate calculus in error propagation.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Statistics**: The RSS method arises from the variance of a sum of independent random variables.

- Predicting worst-case scenarios in aerospace or medical electronics where component variations impact safety.

##### Problem Statement
Two resistors with nominal resistances $ R_1 $ and $ R_2 $ are connected in series. Their absolute uncertainties are $ \Delta R_1 $ and $ \Delta R_2 $, respectively, and these uncertainties are independent. Derive the expression for the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta R_{\text{total}} $ in the total resistance $ R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 $.  

Express your answer as an analytic expression solely in terms of $ \Delta R_1 $ and $ \Delta R_2 $.  

**Formatting Instructions for Final Answer**:  
- Use the exact symbols $ \Delta R_1 $ and $ \Delta R_2 $ as provided.  
- The expression must be simplified and enclosed in a box.  
- Do not include units, as the answer is a symbolic uncertainty expression.

### Solution
The absolute uncertainty in a function of multiple independent variables is given by the root-sum-square of the partial derivatives multiplied by the individual uncertainties. For the total resistance $ R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 $, the uncertainty $ \Delta R_{\text{total}} $ is:  


$$
\Delta R_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial R_{\text{total}}}{\partial R_1} \Delta R_1 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial R_{\text{total}}}{\partial R_2} \Delta R_2 \right)^2 }
$$


Compute the partial derivatives:  

$$
\frac{\partial R_{\text{total}}}{\partial R_1} = \frac{\partial}{\partial R_1} (R_1 + R_2) = 1
$$


$$
\frac{\partial R_{\text{total}}}{\partial R_2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial R_2} (R_1 + R_2) = 1
$$


Substitute these derivatives into the uncertainty formula:  

$$
\Delta R_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{ \left( 1 \cdot \Delta R_1 \right)^2 + \left( 1 \cdot \Delta R_2 \right)^2 } = \sqrt{ (\Delta R_1)^2 + (\Delta R_2)^2 }
$$


Thus, the absolute uncertainty in the total resistance is the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{(\Delta R_1)^2 + (\Delta R_2)^2}}$$

### Problem 12
##### Background
In projectile motion experiments, the horizontal range $R$ of an object launched with initial speed $v$ at an angle $\theta$ to the horizontal is modeled by the equation $R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (known exactly). However, experimental measurements introduce uncertainties: the initial speed is recorded as $v \pm \Delta v$, and the launch angle is recorded as $\theta \pm \Delta \theta$ (with $\Delta \theta$ in radians). Understanding how these uncertainties propagate to the range is essential for reporting reliable results in physics and engineering applications.

2. Propagation of uncertainty for a function of multiple independent variables.
3. Calculation of partial derivatives.
4. Combination of uncertainties in quadrature (root sum of squares).
5. Derivation of relative uncertainty ($\frac{\Delta R}{R}$).

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to kinematics (motion under constant acceleration), calculus (partial differentiation), and data analysis (error quantification). It extends the study of projectile motion by incorporating measurement limitations, a key aspect of experimental physics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Uncertainty analysis is critical in fields like engineering (e.g., trajectory optimization in aerospace), environmental science (e.g., predicting pollutant dispersion), and robotics (e.g., motion planning with sensor errors). The mathematical framework also applies to statistics for error combination in multivariable models.

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate uncertainty quantification is vital in ballistics (estimating projectile impact zones), sports science (analyzing javelin throws), and disaster management (predicting volcanic ejecta ranges). For example, engineers use similar methods to assess landing zone safety for unmanned aerial vehicles under wind-speed uncertainties.

##### Problem Statement
The range $R$ of a projectile is given by $R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$, where $g$ is exact. The initial speed $v$ has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$, and the launch angle $\theta$ (in radians) has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta \theta$. Assume $v$, $\Delta v$, $\theta$, and $\Delta \theta$ are known symbolic quantities, and uncertainties are independent. Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty in the range, $\frac{\Delta R}{R}$, in terms of $v$, $\Delta v$, $\theta$, and $\Delta \theta$.  

Express your answer as a single simplified analytic expression using standard mathematical notation. Use $\cot$ for the cotangent function and ensure all trigonometric functions are explicitly written (e.g., $\sin$, $\cos$, $\cot$).

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta R}{R}$, we use error propagation for a function of independent variables. For $R = f(v, \theta)$, the absolute uncertainty $\Delta R$ is given by:
$$
\Delta R = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial v} \Delta v \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \Delta \theta \right)^2 }
$$
The relative uncertainty is then $\frac{\Delta R}{R}$. We first compute the partial derivatives of $R$ with respect to $v$ and $\theta$.

Start with the range formula:
$$
R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

**Step 1: Partial derivative with respect to $v$**  
Treat $\theta$ and $g$ as constants:
$$
\frac{\partial R}{\partial v} = \frac{2v \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$
Since $R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$, we can rewrite this as:
$$
\frac{\partial R}{\partial v} = \frac{2}{v} \cdot \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} = \frac{2R}{v}
$$

**Step 2: Partial derivative with respect to $\theta$**  
Treat $v$ and $g$ as constants. Use the chain rule, noting that $\frac{d}{d\theta} \sin(2\theta) = 2 \cos(2\theta)$:
$$
\frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} = \frac{v^2}{g} \cdot 2 \cos(2\theta) = \frac{2v^2 \cos(2\theta)}{g}
$$
Substitute $R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$ to express in terms of $R$:
$$
\frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} = \frac{2v^2 \cos(2\theta)}{g} = 2 \cdot \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} \cdot \frac{\cos(2\theta)}{\sin(2\theta)} = 2R \cot(2\theta)
$$

**Step 3: Substitute derivatives into $\Delta R$**  
$$
\Delta R = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{2R}{v} \Delta v \right)^2 + \left( 2R \cot(2\theta) \Delta \theta \right)^2 }
$$
Factor out $2R$:
$$
\Delta R = \sqrt{ (2R)^2 \left[ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \cot(2\theta) \Delta \theta \right)^2 \right] }
$$
Simplify the square root:
$$
\Delta R = 2R \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \cot(2\theta) \Delta \theta \right)^2 }
$$

**Step 4: Relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta R}{R}$**  
Divide both sides by $R$ (assuming $R \neq 0$):
$$
\frac{\Delta R}{R} = 2 \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \cot(2\theta) \Delta \theta \right)^2 }
$$
This is the simplified expression for the relative uncertainty.

### Answer
$$\boxed{2 \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \cot(2\theta) \Delta \theta \right)^2 }}$$

##### Background
In experimental physics, determining the capacitance $C$ of a capacitor often involves measuring the charge $Q$ stored on it and the voltage $V$ across its terminals. These measurements inherently carry uncertainties due to instrument limitations. Charge might be measured using an electrometer with uncertainty $\Delta Q$, while voltage is measured with a voltmeter with uncertainty $\Delta V$. The relationship $C = Q/V$ is used to compute capacitance, but the uncertainties in $Q$ and $V$ propagate to the result. Understanding how these uncertainties combine is essential for evaluating the reliability of the calculated capacitance.

##### Problem Statement
A capacitor's capacitance is determined using the formula $C = Q/V$, where $Q$ is the measured charge with absolute uncertainty $\Delta Q$, and $V$ is the measured voltage with absolute uncertainty $\Delta V$. Assume $Q$ and $V$ are independent measurements. Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty in the capacitance, $\frac{\Delta C}{C}$, in terms of the relative uncertainties in $Q$ and $V$. Use symbolic notation throughout, and express your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta C}{C}$, start with the formula for capacitance:  
$$ C = \frac{Q}{V} $$  
The relative uncertainty in $C$ is defined as:  
$$ \frac{\Delta C}{C} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial C}{\partial Q} \Delta Q \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial C}{\partial V} \Delta V \right)^2 } \cdot \frac{1}{|C|} $$  
Compute the partial derivatives of $C$ with respect to $Q$ and $V$:  
$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial Q} = \frac{1}{V}, \quad \frac{\partial C}{\partial V} = -\frac{Q}{V^2} $$  
Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:  
$$ \Delta C = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{1}{V} \Delta Q \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{Q}{V^2} \Delta V \right)^2 } $$  
Simplify the expression inside the square root:  
$$ \Delta C = \sqrt{ \frac{(\Delta Q)^2}{V^2} + \frac{Q^2 (\Delta V)^2}{V^4} } = \sqrt{ \frac{ V^2 (\Delta Q)^2 + Q^2 (\Delta V)^2 }{V^4} } = \frac{ \sqrt{ V^2 (\Delta Q)^2 + Q^2 (\Delta V)^2 } }{V^2} $$  
Now substitute into the relative uncertainty formula:  
$$ \frac{\Delta C}{C} = \frac{ \frac{ \sqrt{ V^2 (\Delta Q)^2 + Q^2 (\Delta V)^2 } }{V^2} }{ |Q/V| } = \frac{ \sqrt{ V^2 (\Delta Q)^2 + Q^2 (\Delta V)^2 } }{V^2} \cdot \frac{V}{|Q|} $$  
Since $Q > 0$ and $V > 0$ in physical contexts, $|Q| = Q$ and $|V| = V$, so:  
$$ \frac{\Delta C}{C} = \frac{ \sqrt{ V^2 (\Delta Q)^2 + Q^2 (\Delta V)^2 } }{V^2} \cdot \frac{V}{Q} = \frac{ \sqrt{ V^2 (\Delta Q)^2 + Q^2 (\Delta V)^2 } }{V Q} $$  
Factor $Q^2 V^2$ inside the square root:  
$$ \frac{ \sqrt{ V^2 (\Delta Q)^2 + Q^2 (\Delta V)^2 } }{V Q} = \sqrt{ \frac{ V^2 (\Delta Q)^2 + Q^2 (\Delta V)^2 }{ Q^2 V^2 } } = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 } $$  
Thus, the relative uncertainty in $C$ is:  
$$ \frac{\Delta C}{C} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 } $$

### Answer

### Problem 14
##### Background
In experimental physics, wave phenomena are often studied by measuring wavelength and frequency to determine wave speed. For instance, in a laboratory setting using a ripple tank to study water waves, students measure the distance between consecutive wave crests (wavelength, $\lambda$) and count oscillations per unit time (frequency, $f$). Each measurement has inherent uncertainty: wavelength is measured as $\lambda \pm \Delta \lambda$ and frequency as $f \pm \Delta f$, where $\Delta \lambda$ and $\Delta f$ represent absolute uncertainties. The wave speed $v$ is calculated from these measurements using the fundamental relationship $v = \lambda f$.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Propagation of uncertainty for a product of independent variables.
2. Derivation of absolute uncertainty from relative uncertainties.
3. Application of partial derivatives in error analysis.

- Connects to wave mechanics ($v = \lambda f$) and measurement techniques in experimental physics.
- Reinforces concepts of relative and absolute uncertainty from foundational error analysis.
- Extends to uncertainty propagation for other multiplicative relationships (e.g., kinetic energy $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Engineering**: Critical for sensor calibration (e.g., radar speed measurements where wavelength and frequency uncertainties affect velocity accuracy).
- **Environmental Science**: Applies to wave speed calculations in seismology (earthquake detection) or oceanography (tsunami modeling).

##### Real-World Applications
- **Medical Imaging**: Ultrasound technicians must quantify uncertainties in wavelength and frequency to ensure accurate tumor size measurements.
- **Wireless Communication**: Engineers account for uncertainties in signal wavelength and frequency to maintain reliable data transmission in 5G networks.
- **Materials Testing**: Non-destructive testing using ultrasonic waves requires precise error analysis to detect flaws in aircraft components.

##### Problem Statement
Given the wave speed equation $v = \lambda f$, where $\lambda$ and $f$ are measured with independent absolute uncertainties $\Delta \lambda$ and $\Delta f$ respectively, derive the expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$ in the wave speed.  
Express $\Delta v$ symbolically in terms of $\lambda$, $f$, $\Delta \lambda$, and $\Delta f$.  
*Assume no covariance between $\lambda$ and $f$, and use the root-sum-square method for uncertainty propagation.*  
Provide a step-by-step derivation, starting from the general formula for uncertainty propagation.

### Solution
The absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$ for a function $v(\lambda, f)$ is derived using the root-sum-square formula for independent variables:  
$$ (\Delta v)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial \lambda} \Delta \lambda \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial f} \Delta f \right)^2. $$

First, compute the partial derivatives of $v = \lambda f$:  
$$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial \lambda} = f, \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial f} = \lambda. $$

Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:  
$$ (\Delta v)^2 = (f \cdot \Delta \lambda)^2 + (\lambda \cdot \Delta f)^2. $$

Expand the squares:  
$$ (\Delta v)^2 = f^2 (\Delta \lambda)^2 + \lambda^2 (\Delta f)^2. $$

Take the square root of both sides to solve for $\Delta v$:  
$$ \Delta v = \sqrt{ f^2 (\Delta \lambda)^2 + \lambda^2 (\Delta f)^2 }. $$

This is the expression for the absolute uncertainty in $v$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \sqrt{ f^{2} (\Delta \lambda)^{2} + \lambda^{2} (\Delta f)^{2} } }$$

### Problem 15
##### Background
In experimental physics, measurements often include uncertainties that propagate through calculations. Newton's second law states that acceleration $a$ of an object is given by the quotient of net force $F$ and mass $m$. When force is measured as $F \pm \Delta F$ and mass as $m \pm \Delta m$, the uncertainty in acceleration $\Delta a$ must be quantified. Understanding how relative uncertainties combine in quotients is essential for error analysis in mechanics and engineering.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Definition of relative uncertainty: $\frac{\Delta q}{q}$ for a quantity $q$.
2. Error propagation for the quotient of two independent measurements.
3. Application of partial derivatives in uncertainty analysis.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

- Extends to uncertainty principles in measurement-based experiments.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications
- Aerospace engineering: Calculating thrust-to-weight ratios with sensor uncertainties.
- Medical physics: Determining radiation dosage accuracy ($\text{dose} = \text{energy}/\text{mass}$).

##### Problem Statement
A force $F$ is measured with absolute uncertainty $\Delta F$, and a mass $m$ is measured with absolute uncertainty $\Delta m$. The acceleration $a$ is calculated as $a = F/m$. Derive the expression for the **relative uncertainty** $\frac{\Delta a}{a}$ in terms of $F$, $\Delta F$, $m$, and $\Delta m$. Assume $F$ and $m$ are uncorrelated. Express your answer as an analytic expression.

### Solution
The relative uncertainty in acceleration $\frac{\Delta a}{a}$ is derived using error propagation for a quotient. For $a = F/m$, the general uncertainty propagation formula is:
$$
(\Delta a)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial a}{\partial F} \right)^2 (\Delta F)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial a}{\partial m} \right)^2 (\Delta m)^2
$$
First, compute the partial derivatives:
$$
\frac{\partial a}{\partial F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial F} \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) = \frac{1}{m}, \quad \frac{\partial a}{\partial m} = \frac{\partial}{\partial m} \left( \frac{F}{m} \right) = -\frac{F}{m^2}
$$
Substitute into the propagation formula:
$$
(\Delta a)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{m} \right)^2 (\Delta F)^2 + \left( -\frac{F}{m^2} \right)^2 (\Delta m)^2 = \frac{(\Delta F)^2}{m^2} + \frac{F^2 (\Delta m)^2}{m^4}
$$
The relative uncertainty is $\frac{\Delta a}{a}$. Since $a = F/m$:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta a}{a} \right)^2 = \frac{(\Delta a)^2}{a^2} = \frac{ \frac{(\Delta F)^2}{m^2} + \frac{F^2 (\Delta m)^2}{m^4} }{ \left( \frac{F}{m} \right)^2 } = \frac{ \frac{(\Delta F)^2}{m^2} + \frac{F^2 (\Delta m)^2}{m^4} }{ \frac{F^2}{m^2} } = \frac{(\Delta F)^2}{m^2} \cdot \frac{m^2}{F^2} + \frac{F^2 (\Delta m)^2}{m^4} \cdot \frac{m^2}{F^2}
$$
Simplify:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta a}{a} \right)^2 = \frac{(\Delta F)^2}{F^2} + \frac{(\Delta m)^2}{m^2}
$$
Take the square root to obtain the relative uncertainty:
$$
\frac{\Delta a}{a} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 }
$$
This is the expression for the relative uncertainty in acceleration.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^{2} }}$$

Understanding how these individual uncertainties propagate to the calculated power $ P $ requires applying the principles of error propagation.

##### Problem Statement
The power $ P $ dissipated in a resistor is calculated using the formula $ P = \frac{V^2}{R} $, where $ V $ is the voltage (with absolute uncertainty $ \Delta V $) and $ R $ is the resistance (with absolute uncertainty $ \Delta R $). Derive the expression for the **relative uncertainty** in $ P $, denoted as $ \frac{\Delta P}{P} $, in terms of the relative uncertainties $ \frac{\Delta V}{V} $ and $ \frac{\Delta R}{R} $.  

**Answer Requirements:**  
- Express your final answer as a single analytic expression under a square root.  
- Use only the symbols $ \frac{\Delta V}{V} $ and $ \frac{\Delta R}{R} $ in the expression.  
- Do **not** substitute numerical values or simplify beyond the derived form.

### Solution
**Step 1: General uncertainty propagation formula**  
For a function $ P(V, R) $, the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta P $ is given by:  
$$ \Delta P = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} \Delta V \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial R} \Delta R \right)^2 } $$  

**Step 2: Compute partial derivatives**  
Given $ P = V^2 R^{-1} $:  
- Derivative w.r.t. $ V $:  
  $$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} = 2V R^{-1} = \frac{2V}{R} $$  
- Derivative w.r.t. $ R $:  
  $$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial R} = -V^2 R^{-2} = -\frac{V^2}{R^2} $$  

**Step 3: Substitute into uncertainty formula**  
$$ \Delta P = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{2V}{R} \Delta V \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{V^2}{R^2} \Delta R \right)^2 } $$  
Simplify the squares:  
$$ \Delta P = \sqrt{ \frac{4V^2 (\Delta V)^2}{R^2} + \frac{V^4 (\Delta R)^2}{R^4} } $$  

**Step 4: Factor common terms**  
Extract $ \frac{V^2}{R^2} $ from the square root:  
$$ \Delta P = \sqrt{ \frac{V^2}{R^2} \left( 4 (\Delta V)^2 + \frac{V^2 (\Delta R)^2}{R^2} \right) } = \frac{V}{R} \sqrt{ 4 (\Delta V)^2 + \frac{V^2 (\Delta R)^2}{R^2} } $$  

**Step 5: Compute relative uncertainty $ \frac{\Delta P}{P} $**  
Since $ P = \frac{V^2}{R} $, substitute:  
$$ \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{ \Delta P }{ V^2 / R } = \frac{ \frac{V}{R} \sqrt{ 4 (\Delta V)^2 + \frac{V^2 (\Delta R)^2}{R^2} } }{ \frac{V^2}{R} } = \frac{1}{V} \sqrt{ 4 (\Delta V)^2 + \frac{V^2 (\Delta R)^2}{R^2} } $$  

**Step 6: Express in terms of relative uncertainties**  
Rewrite using $ \frac{\Delta V}{V} $ and $ \frac{\Delta R}{R} $:  
- $ 4 (\Delta V)^2 = 4 V^2 \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 $  
- $ \frac{V^2 (\Delta R)^2}{R^2} = V^2 \left( \frac{\Delta R}{R} \right)^2 $  
Substitute:  
$$ \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{1}{V} \sqrt{ 4 V^2 \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 + V^2 \left( \frac{\Delta R}{R} \right)^2 } = \frac{1}{V} \cdot V \sqrt{ 4 \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta R}{R} \right)^2 } $$  
Final simplification:

### Problem 17
##### Background  
In engineering and manufacturing, cylindrical components like storage tanks, pipes, and rollers require precise volume calculations. The volume $V$ of a cylinder depends on its radius $r$ and height $h$, with measurements subject to experimental uncertainties. Understanding how uncertainties propagate through calculations is essential for quality control and design specifications.  

##### Knowledge Points Tested

- Error propagation for multivariable functions  
- Partial differentiation and root-sum-square combination of uncertainties  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections  
- Connects to calculus (partial derivatives) and statistics (variance of derived quantities).  
- Extends to uncertainty analysis in other geometric formulas (e.g., spheres, cones).  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications

- Calculating medication dosage precision in cylindrical syringes.  
- Estimating material volume tolerances in 3D printing.  

##### Problem Statement  
A cylinder has radius $r$ measured with absolute uncertainty $\Delta r$ and height $h$ measured with absolute uncertainty $\Delta h$. The volume is given by $V = \pi r^2 h$.  
Derive an expression for the **relative uncertainty** in the volume, $\frac{\Delta V}{V}$.  
Express your final answer symbolically in terms of the relative uncertainties $\frac{\Delta r}{r}$ and $\frac{\Delta h}{h}$.  
Use the root-sum-square method for error propagation. Box your final expression.

### Solution
**Step 1: Define relative uncertainty**  
The relative uncertainty in volume is $\frac{\Delta V}{V}$, where $\Delta V$ is the absolute uncertainty in $V$.  

**Step 2: General error propagation formula**  
For a function $V(r, h)$, the absolute uncertainty $\Delta V$ is:  
$$  
\Delta V = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \Delta r \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial h} \Delta h \right)^2 }  
$$  

**Step 3: Compute partial derivatives**  
- Partial derivative with respect to $r$:  
  $$  
  \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} = \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (\pi r^2 h) = 2\pi r h  
  $$  
- Partial derivative with respect to $h$:  
  $$  
  \frac{\partial V}{\partial h} = \frac{\partial}{\partial h} (\pi r^2 h) = \pi r^2  
  $$  

**Step 4: Substitute into $\Delta V$**  
$$  
\Delta V = \sqrt{ (2\pi r h \cdot \Delta r)^2 + (\pi r^2 \cdot \Delta h)^2 }  
$$  

**Step 5: Factor out common terms**  
$$  
\Delta V = \sqrt{ (2\pi r h \Delta r)^2 + (\pi r^2 \Delta h)^2 } = \sqrt{ 4\pi^2 r^2 h^2 (\Delta r)^2 + \pi^2 r^4 (\Delta h)^2 }  
$$  
Factor $\pi^2 r^2$:  
$$  
\Delta V = \sqrt{ \pi^2 r^2 \left[ 4 h^2 (\Delta r)^2 + r^2 (\Delta h)^2 \right] } = \pi r \sqrt{ 4 h^2 (\Delta r)^2 + r^2 (\Delta h)^2 }  
$$  

**Step 6: Express $\frac{\Delta V}{V}$**  
Using $V = \pi r^2 h$:  
$$  
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{ \pi r \sqrt{ 4 h^2 (\Delta r)^2 + r^2 (\Delta h)^2 } }{ \pi r^2 h } = \frac{ \sqrt{ 4 h^2 (\Delta r)^2 + r^2 (\Delta h)^2 } }{ r^2 h }  
$$  

**Step 7: Simplify under the square root**  
$$  
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \sqrt{ \frac{ 4 h^2 (\Delta r)^2 + r^2 (\Delta h)^2 }{ r^4 h^2 } } = \sqrt{ \frac{4 h^2 (\Delta r)^2}{r^4 h^2} + \frac{r^2 (\Delta h)^2}{r^4 h^2} } = \sqrt{ \frac{4 (\Delta r)^2}{r^2} \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} + \frac{ (\Delta h)^2 }{ r^2 h^2 } } \quad \text{(incorrect intermediate step; revise directly)}  
$$  
**Correct approach after Step 6:**  
$$  
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \sqrt{ \frac{ 4 h^2 (\Delta r)^2 }{ r^4 h^2 } + \frac{ r^2 (\Delta h)^2 }{ r^4 h^2 } } = \sqrt{ \frac{4 (\Delta r)^2}{r^2} \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \cdot r^2 + \cdots } \quad \text{(better to group terms)}  
$$  
Instead:  
From Step 6:  
$$  
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{1}{r h} \sqrt{ \frac{4 h^2 (\Delta r)^2 + r^2 (\Delta h)^2}{r^2} } = \frac{1}{r h} \cdot \frac{1}{r} \sqrt{4 h^2 (\Delta r)^2 + r^2 (\Delta h)^2} \quad \text{(still messy)}  
$$  
**Optimal path from Step 5:**  
Divide $\Delta V$ by $V$ directly:  
$$  
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{ \sqrt{ (2\pi r h \Delta r)^2 + (\pi r^2 \Delta h)^2 } }{ \pi r^2 h } = \sqrt{ \frac{ (2\pi r h \Delta r)^2 }{ (\pi r^2 h)^2 } + \frac{ (\pi r^2 \Delta h)^2 }{ (\pi r^2 h)^2 } } = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{2\pi r h \Delta r}{\pi r^2 h} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\pi r^2 \Delta h}{\pi r^2 h} \right)^2 }  
$$  
Simplify fractions:  
$$  
= \sqrt{ \left( \frac{2 \Delta r}{r} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 }  
$$  

**Step 8: Final expression**  
Thus, the relative uncertainty in $V$ is:  
$$  
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \sqrt{ \left( 2 \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 }  
$$

### Answer
$$  
\boxed{\sqrt{ \left(2 \frac{\Delta r}{r}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\Delta h}{h}\right)^2 }}  
$$

### Problem 18
##### Background
In an experiment to measure the gravitational potential energy of an object, a student records the mass $m$ of the object, the acceleration due to gravity $g$, and the height $h$ of the object above a reference point. Each measurement has an associated uncertainty: $\Delta m$ for mass, $\Delta g$ for gravity, and $\Delta h$ for height. The gravitational potential energy is calculated as $U = mgh$. To assess the reliability of the result, we need to determine how the uncertainties in the measured quantities propagate to the calculated energy.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Understanding of relative uncertainty and its significance in experimental physics.
2. Application of error propagation rules for products of independent variables.
3. Algebraic manipulation of uncertainty expressions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to kinematics (through gravitational acceleration), energy conservation principles, and statistical analysis in experimental physics. It also reinforces the concept of dimensional analysis when verifying derived uncertainty expressions.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Uncertainty analysis is fundamental to all experimental sciences (e.g., chemistry for reaction yields, biology for population estimates) and engineering disciplines (e.g., structural load calculations). The mathematical root-sum-square method originates from statistics, specifically the propagation of variance in independent random variables.

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate uncertainty quantification is essential in engineering projects (e.g., predicting the energy output of a hydroelectric dam based on water mass and height measurements) and scientific research (e.g., calculating the potential energy of satellites in orbit, where altitude and gravity measurements have inherent errors).

##### Problem Statement
A student measures the mass of an object as $m \pm \Delta m$, the acceleration due to gravity as $g \pm \Delta g$, and the height above a reference point as $h \pm \Delta h$. The gravitational potential energy is calculated using $U = mgh$.  

Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty in $U$, denoted $\frac{\Delta U}{U}$, in terms of the measured quantities and their uncertainties. Express your final answer as a single simplified algebraic expression using the symbols $m$, $\Delta m$, $g$, $\Delta g$, $h$, and $\Delta h$.

### Solution
The relative uncertainty in $U$ is derived using error propagation rules for products of independent variables. For a function $U = mgh$, where $m$, $g$, and $h$ are independent measured quantities with absolute uncertainties $\Delta m$, $\Delta g$, and $\Delta h$, the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta U}{U}$ is given by the root sum square of the relative uncertainties of each variable:  
$$  
\frac{\Delta U}{U} = \sqrt{  
\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial m} \cdot \frac{\Delta m}{U} \right)^2 +  
\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial g} \cdot \frac{\Delta g}{U} \right)^2 +  
\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial h} \cdot \frac{\Delta h}{U} \right)^2  
}  
$$  
First, compute the partial derivatives:  
$$  
\frac{\partial U}{\partial m} = gh, \quad  
\frac{\partial U}{\partial g} = mh, \quad  
\frac{\partial U}{\partial h} = mg  
$$  
Substitute these into the error propagation formula:  
$$  
\frac{\Delta U}{U} = \sqrt{  
\left( gh \cdot \frac{\Delta m}{mgh} \right)^2 +  
\left( mh \cdot \frac{\Delta g}{mgh} \right)^2 +  
\left( mg \cdot \frac{\Delta h}{mgh} \right)^2  
}  
$$  
Simplify each term:  
$$  
gh \cdot \frac{\Delta m}{mgh} = \frac{\Delta m}{m}, \quad  
mh \cdot \frac{\Delta g}{mgh} = \frac{\Delta g}{g}, \quad  
mg \cdot \frac{\Delta h}{mgh} = \frac{\Delta h}{h}  
$$  
Thus, the expression simplifies to:  
$$  
\frac{\Delta U}{U} = \sqrt{  
\left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 +  
\left( \frac{\Delta g}{g} \right)^2 +  
\left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2  
}  
$$  
This is the relative uncertainty in $U$.

### Answer
$$ \boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta g}{g} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 } } $$

### Problem 19
##### Background
In an electronics experiment, you are measuring the time constant $ \tau $ of a resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit, which determines how quickly the capacitor charges or discharges. The time constant is defined as $ \tau = RC $, where $ R $ is the resistance and $ C $ is the capacitance. Your digital multimeter reports the resistance as $ R $ with an absolute uncertainty $ \Delta R $, and your capacitance meter reports the capacitance as $ C $ with an absolute uncertainty $ \Delta C $. The instruments are calibrated independently, so the uncertainties in $ R $ and $ C $ are uncorrelated.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Propagation of uncertainty for a product of independent variables.
2. Partial derivatives in multivariable error analysis.
3. Construction of absolute uncertainty expressions from first principles.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- Connects to circuit analysis in physics, where time constants model transient behavior.
- Extends to uncertainty calculations in other physics formulas involving products (e.g., kinetic energy $ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $, gravitational force $ G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2} $).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Essential for tolerance analysis in electronic component selection.
- **Statistics**: Relies on the root-sum-square (RSS) method for combining variances of independent random variables.
- **Metrology**: Demonstrates how measurement instrument precision affects derived quantities.

##### Real-World Applications
- Designing timing circuits in medical devices (e.g., pacemakers) where precise pulse durations are critical.
- Calibrating analog-to-digital converters in data acquisition systems.
- Quality control in manufacturing electronic filters for audio equipment.

##### Problem Statement
Using the general formula for propagation of uncertainty, derive the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta \tau $ in the time constant $ \tau = RC $. Assume $ R $ and $ C $ are independent measurements with absolute uncertainties $ \Delta R $ and $ \Delta C $, respectively. Express $ \Delta \tau $ symbolically in terms of $ R $, $ C $, $ \Delta R $, and $ \Delta C $.  
**Format Instructions**:  
- Use the variables $ R $, $ C $, $ \Delta R $, and $ \Delta C $ exactly as defined.  
- Write all terms explicitly (e.g., use $ \Delta R^2 $, not $ (\Delta R)^2 $).  
- Express the final answer as a single square root expression.

### Solution
To find the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta \tau $ in $ \tau = RC $, we apply the root-sum-square formula for a function of two independent variables:  
$$  
\Delta \tau = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial R} \Delta R \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial C} \Delta C \right)^2 }.  
$$  

**Step 1: Compute partial derivatives**  
- Partial derivative of $ \tau $ with respect to $ R $:  
  $$  
  \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial R} = \frac{\partial}{\partial R}(RC) = C.  
  $$  
- Partial derivative of $ \tau $ with respect to $ C $:  
  $$  
  \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial C} = \frac{\partial}{\partial C}(RC) = R.  
  $$  

**Step 2: Substitute into uncertainty formula**  
Insert the partial derivatives into the root-sum-square expression:  
$$  
\Delta \tau = \sqrt{ \left( C \cdot \Delta R \right)^2 + \left( R \cdot \Delta C \right)^2 }.  
$$  

**Step 3: Simplify the expression**  
Expand the squared terms:  
$$  
\Delta \tau = \sqrt{ C^2 \Delta R^2 + R^2 \Delta C^2 }.  
$$  

This is the symbolic expression for the absolute uncertainty in $ \tau $. The derivation assumes independence between $ \Delta R $ and $ \Delta C $, as stated in the problem.

### Answer
$$  
\boxed{\sqrt{ C^{2} \Delta R^{2} + R^{2} \Delta C^{2} }}  
$$

### Problem 2
##### Background
In a physics laboratory experiment, students are measuring the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum to verify the relationship between the period and the pendulum's length. The theoretical period $ T $ of a simple pendulum is derived from the principles of harmonic motion under small-angle approximation and is given by $ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} $, where $ L $ is the length of the pendulum and $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity. The length $ L $ is measured with a ruler that has a known absolute uncertainty $ \Delta L $. The value of $ g $ is treated as exact (no uncertainty) in this experiment.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Understanding the functional form of the pendulum period equation.
2. Application of error propagation for a single-variable power-law function.
3. Derivation of relative uncertainty using logarithmic differentiation or partial derivatives.
4. Simplification of expressions involving uncertainties.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to harmonic motion (physics) and uncertainty analysis in experimental measurements. It reinforces how errors in measured quantities propagate through derived quantities, a fundamental concept in data analysis across scientific disciplines.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Precision in pendulum-based timing mechanisms (e.g., clocks) requires quantifying uncertainty.
- **Statistics**: The relative uncertainty derivation uses principles of differential calculus for error propagation, linking to statistical methods for handling measurement errors.

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate uncertainty analysis is critical in:
- Gravimetry (measuring $ g $ for geological surveys).
- Designing inertial navigation systems where pendulum-like sensors are used.
- Calibrating timekeeping devices in horology.

##### Problem Statement
The period $ T $ of a simple pendulum is given by $ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} $, where $ g $ is known exactly, and $ L $ is measured with an absolute uncertainty $ \Delta L $. Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty in the period, $ \frac{\Delta T}{T} $, in terms of $ L $ and $ \Delta L $.  
Express your answer as a single simplified fraction.  
**Important**: Do not substitute numerical values; keep all constants symbolic. Use exact fractions in the final expression.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $ \frac{\Delta T}{T} $, we start with the pendulum period formula:  
$$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} $$  
Rewriting for clarity:  
$$ T = 2\pi \left( \frac{L}{g} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$  
Since $ g $ is exact, $ T $ depends only on $ L $. The relative uncertainty in $ T $ is related to the absolute uncertainty in $ L $ ($ \Delta L $) via:  
$$ \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \left| \frac{\partial T}{\partial L} \right| \frac{\Delta L}{T} $$  
First, compute the partial derivative $ \frac{\partial T}{\partial L} $:  
$$ \frac{\partial T}{\partial L} = 2\pi \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{L}{g} \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{g} = \pi \left( \frac{L}{g} \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \frac{1}{g} $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ \frac{\partial T}{\partial L} = \pi \cdot \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}} \cdot \frac{1}{g} = \pi \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{gL}} $$  
Now substitute into the relative uncertainty formula:  
$$ \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \left| \pi \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{gL}} \right| \frac{\Delta L}{T} $$  
Since $ \pi $, $ g $, and $ L $ are positive, the absolute value can be omitted. Replace $ T $ with its expression:  
$$ \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \pi \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{gL}} \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}} $$  
Simplify the denominator:  
$$ 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} = 2\pi \cdot \frac{\sqrt{L}}{\sqrt{g}} $$  
Thus:  
$$ \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{gL}} \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{2\pi \cdot \frac{\sqrt{L}}{\sqrt{g}}}} = \frac{\pi \Delta L}{\sqrt{gL}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{g}}{2\pi \sqrt{L}} $$  
Cancel $ \pi $ and $ \sqrt{g} $:  
$$ \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \frac{\Delta L}{\sqrt{gL} \cdot 2 \sqrt{L}} \cdot \sqrt{g} = \frac{\Delta L}{2 L} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{g}}{\sqrt{g}} = \frac{\Delta L}{2L} $$  
The relative uncertainty is:  
$$ \frac{\Delta T}{T} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta L}{L} $$  
This result shows that the relative uncertainty in $ T $ is half the relative uncertainty in $ L $.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{\Delta L}{L}}$$

### Problem 20
##### Background
Resistivity is a fundamental property of materials that quantifies how strongly they resist electric current flow. In experimental physics and engineering, resistivity $\rho$ is determined through measurements of resistance $R$, cross-sectional area $A$, and length $L$ of a material sample. Each measured quantity carries inherent experimental uncertainty due to instrument precision and environmental factors. This problem explores how uncertainties propagate through the formula $\rho = \frac{R A}{L}$, requiring derivation of the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho}$ from the absolute uncertainties $\Delta R$, $\Delta A$, and $\Delta L$.

##### Problem Statement
A cylindrical wire sample has resistance $R \pm \Delta R$, cross-sectional area $A \pm \Delta A$, and length $L \pm \Delta L$. The resistivity is calculated as $\rho = \frac{R A}{L}$. Derive the expression for the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho}$ in terms of the relative uncertainties of the measured quantities. Assume all uncertainties are independent and random. Express your final answer as an analytic expression using $\frac{\Delta R}{R}$, $\frac{\Delta A}{A}$, and $\frac{\Delta L}{L}$.

### Solution
The relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho}$ is derived using error propagation for the function $\rho(R, A, L) = R \cdot A \cdot L^{-1}$. For a function of multiple variables, the relative uncertainty is given by:

$$
\left( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial R} \cdot \frac{\Delta R}{\rho} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial A} \cdot \frac{\Delta A}{\rho} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial L} \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{\rho} \right)^2
$$

Compute each partial derivative:

- $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial R} = \frac{A}{L}$
- $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial A} = \frac{R}{L}$
- $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial L} = - \frac{R A}{L^2}$

Substitute these into the propagation equation:

$$
\left( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{A}{L} \cdot \frac{\Delta R}{\rho} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{R}{L} \cdot \frac{\Delta A}{\rho} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{R A}{L^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{\rho} \right)^2
$$

Simplify each term using $\rho = \frac{R A}{L}$:

- First term: $\frac{A}{L} \cdot \frac{\Delta R}{\rho} = \frac{A}{L} \cdot \frac{\Delta R}{\frac{R A}{L}} = \frac{\Delta R}{R}$
- Second term: $\frac{R}{L} \cdot \frac{\Delta A}{\rho} = \frac{R}{L} \cdot \frac{\Delta A}{\frac{R A}{L}} = \frac{\Delta A}{A}$
- Third term: $\left| -\frac{R A}{L^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{\rho} \right| = \frac{R A}{L^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{\frac{R A}{L}} = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$

The equation becomes:

$$
\left( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta R}{R} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2
$$

Taking the square root of both sides gives the relative uncertainty:

$$
\frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta R}{R} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 }
$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta R}{R} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 }}$$

### Problem 21
##### Background
In electrical engineering, when designing circuits with resistors, manufacturing tolerances lead to uncertainties in resistance values. When resistors are connected in parallel, the equivalent resistance is given by the formula for parallel resistors. Understanding how uncertainties propagate through this formula is essential for predicting the reliability and performance of circuits. For instance, in applications like sensor networks or audio equipment, even small uncertainties can affect signal accuracy and power distribution.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

This problem connects to circuit theory, where equivalent resistance calculations are fundamental. It also ties into the broader study of error analysis in experimental physics, such as when measuring resistance in Wheatstone bridges or analyzing series-parallel networks. The mathematical techniques used here are foundational for more advanced topics like sensitivity analysis in system design.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Problem Statement
Two resistors, $R_1$ and $R_2$, are connected in parallel. The equivalent resistance $R_p$ is given by:
$$ R_p = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} $$
The resistor $R_1$ has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta R_1$, and $R_2$ has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta R_2$. These uncertainties are independent. Derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta R_p$ in the equivalent resistance $R_p$. Express $\Delta R_p$ symbolically in terms of $R_1$, $R_2$, $\Delta R_1$, and $\Delta R_2$ only.  
Your final answer must be an analytic expression enclosed in a box. Use the notation $\Delta R_1$ and $\Delta R_2$ for the uncertainties, and ensure all variables are clearly defined in your derivation.

### Solution
To find the absolute uncertainty $\Delta R_p$ in the equivalent resistance $R_p$, we use the formula for propagation of uncertainties for a function of two independent variables. For a function $f(x, y)$, the absolute uncertainty $\Delta f$ is given by:
$$ \Delta f = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \Delta x \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \Delta y \right)^2 } $$
Here, $f \equiv R_p$, $x \equiv R_1$, $y \equiv R_2$, $\Delta x \equiv \Delta R_1$, and $\Delta y \equiv \Delta R_2$. Thus:
$$ \Delta R_p = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial R_p}{\partial R_1} \Delta R_1 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial R_p}{\partial R_2} \Delta R_2 \right)^2 } $$
We now compute the partial derivatives of $R_p$ with respect to $R_1$ and $R_2$.

First, find $\frac{\partial R_p}{\partial R_1}$. Rewrite $R_p$ as:
$$ R_p = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} $$
Using the quotient rule, where $u = R_1 R_2$ and $v = R_1 + R_2$:
$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial R_1} = R_2, \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial R_1} = 1 $$
The quotient rule states:
$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial R_1} \left( \frac{u}{v} \right) = \frac{ \frac{\partial u}{\partial R_1} v - u \frac{\partial v}{\partial R_1} }{v^2} $$
Substituting:
$$ \frac{\partial R_p}{\partial R_1} = \frac{ R_2 (R_1 + R_2) - (R_1 R_2) \cdot 1 }{ (R_1 + R_2)^2 } = \frac{ R_1 R_2 + R_2^2 - R_1 R_2 }{ (R_1 + R_2)^2 } = \frac{ R_2^2 }{ (R_1 + R_2)^2 } $$

Next, find $\frac{\partial R_p}{\partial R_2}$. Similarly, $u = R_1 R_2$ and $v = R_1 + R_2$:
$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial R_2} = R_1, \quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial R_2} = 1 $$
Applying the quotient rule:
$$ \frac{\partial R_p}{\partial R_2} = \frac{ R_1 (R_1 + R_2) - (R_1 R_2) \cdot 1 }{ (R_1 + R_2)^2 } = \frac{ R_1^2 + R_1 R_2 - R_1 R_2 }{ (R_1 + R_2)^2 } = \frac{ R_1^2 }{ (R_1 + R_2)^2 } $$

Substitute these partial derivatives into the uncertainty formula:
$$ \Delta R_p = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{R_2^2}{(R_1 + R_2)^2} \Delta R_1 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{R_1^2}{(R_1 + R_2)^2} \Delta R_2 \right)^2 } $$
Factor out the common denominator $(R_1 + R_2)^4$ from the squares:
$$ \Delta R_p = \sqrt{ \frac{ (R_2^2 \Delta R_1)^2 + (R_1^2 \Delta R_2)^2 }{ (R_1 + R_2)^4 } } = \frac{ \sqrt{ (R_2^2 \Delta R_1)^2 + (R_1^2 \Delta R_2)^2 } }{ (R_1 + R_2)^2 } $$
The expression under the square root can be written as:
$$ (R_2^2 \Delta R_1)^2 + (R_1^2 \Delta R_2)^2 = R_2^4 (\Delta R_1)^2 + R_1^4 (\Delta R_2)^2 $$
Thus:
$$ \Delta R_p = \frac{ \sqrt{ R_2^4 (\Delta R_1)^2 + R_1^4 (\Delta R_2)^2 } }{ (R_1 + R_2)^2 } $$
This is the final expression for the absolute uncertainty in $R_p$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{R_{2}^{4} \left(\Delta R_{1}\right)^{2} + R_{1}^{4} \left(\Delta R_{2}\right)^{2}}}{\left(R_{1} + R_{2}\right)^{2}}}$$

### Problem 22
##### Background
In optics, the thin lens equation relates the focal length $f$ of a lens to the object distance $u$ and the image distance $v$:  

$$ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}. $$
  
Experimental measurements of $u$ and $v$ inherently carry uncertainties. For example, in laser-based alignment systems or microscope calibration, precise knowledge of the uncertainty in $f$ is critical for assessing system reliability. Here, $u$ is measured as $u \pm \Delta u$ and $v$ as $v \pm \Delta v$, with independent random uncertainties.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Error propagation for functions of multiple variables.  
2. Partial differentiation of implicitly defined physical relationships.  
3. Absolute uncertainty derivation using the root-sum-square method for independent measurements.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
Connects to geometric optics (lens equation) and statistical analysis of measurement errors in experimental physics. Also reinforces calculus applications in physics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Links to engineering (tolerance analysis in optical instrument design) and data science (uncertainty quantification in regression models of physical systems).

##### Real-World Applications
- Calibrating camera lenses to ensure image sharpness within specified tolerances.  
- Determining acceptable error margins in telescopic mirror alignment for astronomy.  
- Quality control in eyeglass lens manufacturing to meet vision-correction standards.

##### Problem Statement
Using the thin lens equation $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}$, derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta f$ in the focal length $f$ in terms of $u$, $v$, $\Delta u$, and $\Delta v$. Assume $\Delta u$ and $\Delta v$ are independent random uncertainties.  
Express $\Delta f$ as a simplified analytic expression. Use only the symbols $u$, $v$, $\Delta u$, and $\Delta v$.

**Formatting Requirements**:  
- Use explicit derivatives and algebraic steps.  
- Express all exponents with the `^` operator (e.g., $u^4$).  
- Write square roots as `\sqrt{...}`.  
- Write fractions as `\frac{...}{...}`.  
- Do **not** substitute numerical values or constants.

### Solution
The absolute uncertainty $\Delta f$ is derived using error propagation for a function of two variables. For $f(u,v)$, the uncertainty is:  

$$
\Delta f = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \Delta u \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} \Delta v \right)^2 }.
$$
  
First, solve the lens equation for $f$:  

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{u + v}{uv} \implies f = \frac{uv}{u + v}.
$$
  
Compute partial derivatives using the quotient rule. For $\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}$:  

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = \frac{ (v)(u + v) - (uv)(1) }{ (u + v)^2 } = \frac{ \cancel{uv} + v^2 - \cancel{uv} }{ (u + v)^2 } = \frac{v^2}{(u + v)^2}.
$$
  
For $\frac{\partial f}{\partial v}$:  

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = \frac{ (u)(u + v) - (uv)(1) }{ (u + v)^2 } = \frac{ u^2 + \cancel{uv} - \cancel{uv} }{ (u + v)^2 } = \frac{u^2}{(u + v)^2}.
$$
  
Substitute into the uncertainty formula:  

$$
\Delta f = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{v^2}{(u + v)^2} \Delta u \right)^2 + \left( \frac{u^2}{(u + v)^2} \Delta v \right)^2 }.
$$
  
Simplify the squares:  

$$
\Delta f = \sqrt{ \frac{v^4 \Delta u^2}{(u + v)^4} + \frac{u^4 \Delta v^2}{(u + v)^4} } = \sqrt{ \frac{ v^4 \Delta u^2 + u^4 \Delta v^2 }{ (u + v)^4 } }.
$$
  
Extract terms from the square root:  

$$
\Delta f = \frac{ \sqrt{ v^4 \Delta u^2 + u^4 \Delta v^2 } }{ (u + v)^2 }.
$$
  
Factor the expression under the square root:  

$$
\Delta f = \frac{ \sqrt{ (v^2 \Delta u)^2 + (u^2 \Delta v)^2 } }{ (u + v)^2 }.
$$
  
This is the simplified analytic expression for the absolute uncertainty in $f$.

### Answer
\[
\boxed{ \dfrac{ \sqrt{ \left( v^{2} \Delta u \right)^{2} + \left( u^{2} \Delta v \right)^{2} } }{ \left( u + v \right)^{2} } }
\]

### Problem 23
##### Background
In physics experiments, precise measurements are crucial. When calculating derived quantities, understanding how uncertainties propagate through formulas is essential. The force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is given by $ F = B I L \sin\theta $, where $ B $ is the magnetic field strength, $ I $ is the current, $ L $ is the conductor length, and $ \theta $ is the angle between the conductor and the magnetic field. Each measured quantity has an associated absolute uncertainty: $ \Delta B $ for $ B $, $ \Delta I $ for $ I $, $ \Delta L $ for $ L $, and $ \Delta \theta $ for $ \theta $.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Error propagation formulas for absolute uncertainty.
3. Trigonometric derivatives and their role in uncertainty analysis.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to calculus (partial derivatives) and statistics (uncertainty propagation), both integral to experimental physics and data analysis across mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Uncertainty propagation is vital in engineering (e.g., tolerance analysis), environmental science (e.g., climate modeling), and economics (e.g., risk assessment in financial models).

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate uncertainty calculation is critical in designing electromagnetic devices (e.g., motors, MRI machines), where force predictions affect structural integrity and safety margins. It also underpins quality control in manufacturing processes involving magnetic fields.

##### Problem Statement
The force $ F $ on a current-carrying wire is modeled as $ F = B I L \sin\theta $. The measured quantities and their absolute uncertainties are:
- Magnetic field strength: $ B \pm \Delta B $
- Current: $ I \pm \Delta I $
- Length: $ L \pm \Delta L $
- Angle: $ \theta \pm \Delta \theta $ (with $ \theta $ in radians).

Derive the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta F $ in the force. Express $ \Delta F $ symbolically in terms of $ B, I, L, \theta, \Delta B, \Delta I, \Delta L, \Delta \theta $. Ensure your final expression is a single closed-form analytic formula under a square root.

### Solution
The absolute uncertainty $ \Delta F $ for a function $ F(B, I, L, \theta) $ is given by the error propagation formula for independent variables:

$$
\Delta F = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial B} \Delta B \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial I} \Delta I \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial L} \Delta L \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta} \Delta \theta \right)^2 }.
$$


First, compute the partial derivatives of $ F = B I L \sin\theta $:
- Derivative with respect to $ B $:
  
$$
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial B} = I L \sin\theta.
  $$

- Derivative with respect to $ I $:
  
$$
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial I} = B L \sin\theta.
  $$

- Derivative with respect to $ L $:
  
$$
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial L} = B I \sin\theta.
  $$

- Derivative with respect to $ \theta $:
  
$$
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta} = B I L \cos\theta.
  $$


Substitute these derivatives into the uncertainty formula:

$$
\Delta F = \sqrt{ \left( (I L \sin\theta) \Delta B \right)^2 + \left( (B L \sin\theta) \Delta I \right)^2 + \left( (B I \sin\theta) \Delta L \right)^2 + \left( (B I L \cos\theta) \Delta \theta \right)^2 }.
$$


Factor out common terms where possible. The first three terms share $ \sin\theta $, while the last term has $ \cos\theta $:

$$
\Delta F = \sqrt{ (I L \sin\theta \cdot \Delta B)^2 + (B L \sin\theta \cdot \Delta I)^2 + (B I \sin\theta \cdot \Delta L)^2 + (B I L \cos\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2 }.
$$


This is the simplified expression for the absolute uncertainty in $ F $.

### Answer
$$
\boxed{\sqrt{ (I L \sin\theta \cdot \Delta B)^2 + (B L \sin\theta \cdot \Delta I)^2 + (B I \sin\theta \cdot \Delta L)^2 + (B I L \cos\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2 }}
$$

### Problem 24
##### Background
In experimental physics and engineering, accurately determining quantities like centripetal acceleration is crucial for applications such as designing centrifuges for medical laboratories, analyzing the motion of satellites, or testing materials under high stress. Centripetal acceleration, given by $ a = \omega^2 r $, depends on angular velocity $\omega$ and radius $r$. However, measurements of $\omega$ and $r$ always involve uncertainties, denoted as $\Delta \omega$ and $\Delta r$. To assess the reliability of the calculated acceleration, we must propagate these uncertainties through the formula.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. **Error propagation for power-law functions**: Deriving the relative uncertainty in a product of variables raised to powers.
2. **Partial derivatives in uncertainty analysis**: Applying calculus to quantify how small changes in input variables affect the output.
3. **Relative uncertainty definition**: Understanding $\frac{\Delta a}{a}$ as a dimensionless measure of precision.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- **Calculus**: Using partial derivatives to linearize the function $a(\omega, r)$.
- **Statistics**: Combining independent uncertainties via root-sum-square addition, assuming uncorrelated errors.
- **Classical mechanics**: Linking centripetal acceleration to rotational dynamics.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Medical centrifuges**: Ensuring precise separation of blood components by controlling acceleration tolerances.
- **Particle physics**: Propagating measurement errors in cyclotron trajectory calculations.

##### Problem Statement
An experimental setup measures the angular velocity of a rotating object as $\omega \pm \Delta \omega$ and the radius of its circular path as $r \pm \Delta r$. The centripetal acceleration is calculated using $a = \omega^2 r$.  
Derive the expression for the **relative uncertainty** $\frac{\Delta a}{a}$ in terms of the relative uncertainties $\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega}$ and $\frac{\Delta r}{r}$.  
Express your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression.  
*Instructions*:  
- Use exact symbolic notation throughout (no numerical substitution).  
- Employ the root-sum-square method for independent uncertainties.  
- Write logarithms as $\ln$ for natural log and $\log_b$ for other bases.  
- Express powers using the caret symbol with braces (e.g., $x^{2}$).  
- Do **not** include units, as the result is dimensionless.

### Solution
The relative uncertainty in $a$ is derived using error propagation for independent variables. For a function $a(\omega, r)$, the general formula for relative uncertainty is:  
$$ \frac{\Delta a}{a} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial a}{\partial \omega} \frac{\Delta \omega}{a} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial a}{\partial r} \frac{\Delta r}{a} \right)^2 } $$  
First, compute the partial derivatives of $a = \omega^2 r$:  
- With respect to $\omega$: $\frac{\partial a}{\partial \omega} = 2 \omega r$  
- With respect to $r$: $\frac{\partial a}{\partial r} = \omega^2$  

Substitute these into the relative uncertainty formula:  
$$ \frac{\Delta a}{a} = \sqrt{ \left( (2 \omega r) \frac{\Delta \omega}{a} \right)^2 + \left( \omega^2 \frac{\Delta r}{a} \right)^2 } $$  

Replace $a$ with $\omega^2 r$ in the denominator:  
$$ \frac{\Delta a}{a} = \sqrt{ \left( 2 \omega r \cdot \frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega^2 r} \right)^2 + \left( \omega^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta r}{\omega^2 r} \right)^2 } $$  
Simplify each term:  
- First term: $2 \omega r \cdot \frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega^2 r} = 2 \frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega}$  
- Second term: $\omega^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta r}{\omega^2 r} = \frac{\Delta r}{r}$  

Thus, the expression simplifies to:  
$$ \frac{\Delta a}{a} = \sqrt{ \left( 2 \frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 } $$  

Factor out the squares:  
$$ \frac{\Delta a}{a} = \sqrt{ 4 \left( \frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 } $$  
This is the final expression for the relative uncertainty.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{4 \left( \frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^{2}}}$$

### Problem 25
##### Background
In thermodynamics, the heat transfer $ Q $ to an object is often calculated using the formula $ Q = mc\Delta T $, where $ m $ is the object's mass, $ c $ is its specific heat capacity, and $ \Delta T $ is its temperature change. Experimental measurements of these quantities always involve uncertainties due to instrument precision, environmental fluctuations, and human error. For example, in materials science labs, determining the specific heat of a new alloy requires propagating uncertainties from mass scales, thermometers, and calorimeters to report reliable results. This problem explores how uncertainties combine in a multiplicative physical relationship.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Calculation of relative uncertainty.
3. Application of partial derivatives in error analysis.
4. Root-sum-square (RSS) method for combining independent uncertainties.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to thermodynamics (heat transfer equations), measurement theory (absolute vs. relative uncertainty), and calculus (partial differentiation for sensitivity analysis). It also reinforces dimensional consistency when combining terms.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Statistics**: Variance propagation for multiplicative models resembles the formula for the variance of a product of random variables.
- **Engineering**: Uncertainty analysis is critical in thermal system design (e.g., heat exchangers) and materials testing.
- **Metrology**: Techniques for quantifying measurement errors align with international standards (e.g., ISO/IEC Guide 98-3).

##### Real-World Applications
- Calorimetry experiments in chemistry labs to determine specific heats.
- Quality control in manufacturing processes involving heat treatment.
- Climate science models estimating ocean heat absorption with instrument uncertainties.

##### Problem Statement
The heat transfer $ Q $ is calculated as $ Q = m c \Delta T $, where:
- Mass $ m $ has an absolute uncertainty $ \Delta m $,
- Specific heat capacity $ c $ has an absolute uncertainty $ \Delta c $,
- Temperature change $ \Delta T $ has an absolute uncertainty $ \Delta(\Delta T) $.

Assume all uncertainties are independent. Derive an expression for the **relative uncertainty** in $ Q $, denoted $ \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} $, in terms of the given quantities. Express your final answer as a simplified analytic expression using the symbols $ m $, $ \Delta m $, $ c $, $ \Delta c $, $ \Delta T $, and $ \Delta(\Delta T) $.

*Note: The relative uncertainty of a quantity $ x $ is defined as $ \frac{\Delta x}{|x|} $.*

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $ \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} $, we use the root-sum-square (RSS) method for error propagation. For a function $ Q = f(m, c, \Delta T) $ with independent uncertainties, the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta Q $ is:

$$
(\Delta Q)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial m} \Delta m \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial c} \Delta c \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial (\Delta T)} \Delta(\Delta T) \right)^2
$$

First, compute the partial derivatives of $ Q = m c \Delta T $:

- With respect to $ m $:  
  $$ \frac{\partial Q}{\partial m} = c \Delta T $$

- With respect to $ c $:  
  $$ \frac{\partial Q}{\partial c} = m \Delta T $$

- With respect to $ \Delta T $:  
  $$ \frac{\partial Q}{\partial (\Delta T)} = m c $$

Substitute these into the RSS formula:

$$
(\Delta Q)^2 = (c \Delta T \cdot \Delta m)^2 + (m \Delta T \cdot \Delta c)^2 + (m c \cdot \Delta(\Delta T))^2
$$

Simplify each term:

$$
(\Delta Q)^2 = (c \Delta T)^2 (\Delta m)^2 + (m \Delta T)^2 (\Delta c)^2 + (m c)^2 [\Delta(\Delta T)]^2
$$

The relative uncertainty is $ \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} $. Since $ Q = m c \Delta T $, we divide both sides by $ Q^2 $:

$$
\left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2 = \frac{(\Delta Q)^2}{Q^2} = \frac{ (c \Delta T)^2 (\Delta m)^2 + (m \Delta T)^2 (\Delta c)^2 + (m c)^2 [\Delta(\Delta T)]^2 }{ (m c \Delta T)^2 }
$$

Break this into three fractions:

$$
= \frac{ (c \Delta T)^2 (\Delta m)^2 }{ (m c \Delta T)^2 } + \frac{ (m \Delta T)^2 (\Delta c)^2 }{ (m c \Delta T)^2 } + \frac{ (m c)^2 [\Delta(\Delta T)]^2 }{ (m c \Delta T)^2 }
$$

Simplify each term:

1. $ \frac{ (c \Delta T)^2 (\Delta m)^2 }{ (m c \Delta T)^2 } = \frac{ (\Delta m)^2 }{ m^2 } $
2. $ \frac{ (m \Delta T)^2 (\Delta c)^2 }{ (m c \Delta T)^2 } = \frac{ (\Delta c)^2 }{ c^2 } $
3. $ \frac{ (m c)^2 [\Delta(\Delta T)]^2 }{ (m c \Delta T)^2 } = \frac{ [\Delta(\Delta T)]^2 }{ (\Delta T)^2 } $

Thus:

$$
\left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta c}{c} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{\Delta T} \right)^2
$$

Take the square root to obtain the relative uncertainty:

$$
\frac{\Delta Q}{Q} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta c}{c} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{\Delta T} \right)^2 }
$$

This is the final expression for the relative uncertainty in $ Q $.

### Answer
\[ \boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta c}{c} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{\Delta T} \right)^{2} } } \]

### Problem 26
##### Background
In a physics laboratory experiment, you are investigating the pressure exerted by a metal cube resting on a horizontal surface. Pressure, defined as force per unit area, is given by $ P = F / A $, where $ F $ is the force applied perpendicular to the surface and $ A $ is the contact area. The force is measured using a calibrated force sensor, and the area is determined from the side length of the cube using a precision caliper. The measurements are recorded with their absolute uncertainties:

- Force: $ F \pm \Delta F $
- Area: $ A \pm \Delta A $

The uncertainties $\Delta F$ and $\Delta A$ arise from instrumental limitations and are independent random errors. Your task is to quantify how these uncertainties propagate to the calculated pressure.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Definition of relative uncertainty.
- Error propagation for a quotient of two measured quantities.

- Extends to uncertainty analysis in derived quantities across physics experiments, such as density calculations or Ohm's law applications.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- Environmental science: Used in modeling pollutant dispersion or pressure variations in fluid systems.

##### Real-World Applications
- Calibration of pressure sensors in automotive safety systems (e.g., airbag deployment).
- Quality control in manufacturing processes where force and area tolerances affect product reliability (e.g., semiconductor wafer pressing).
- Medical devices: Estimating uncertainties in blood pressure monitors or prosthetic load-bearing surfaces.

##### Problem Statement
Using the principles of uncertainty propagation for independent random errors, derive an analytic expression for the relative uncertainty in the pressure, $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$, in terms of the relative uncertainties in force $\left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)$ and area $\left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)$.  
**Express your answer as a single simplified analytic expression using only the symbols $\frac{\Delta F}{F}$ and $\frac{\Delta A}{A}$.**

### Solution
To derive the relative uncertainty in pressure, start with the definition of pressure:

$$
P = \frac{F}{A}.
$$

Since $P$ depends on two measured quantities, $F$ and $A$, with independent random uncertainties, the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$ is found using error propagation for a quotient. The general formula for the relative uncertainty of a quotient $Q = \frac{x}{y}$ is:

$$
\left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta x}{x} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta y}{y} \right)^2,
$$

for uncorrelated uncertainties. Applying this to $P = F / A$:

$$
\left( \frac{\Delta P}{P} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^2.
$$

Taking the square root to solve for $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$:

$$
\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^2 }.
$$


**Derivation via logarithmic differentiation (alternative method):**  
Take the natural logarithm of both sides of $P = F / A$:

$$
\ln P = \ln F - \ln A.
$$

Differentiate with respect to the variables:

$$
d(\ln P) = d(\ln F) - d(\ln A) \implies \frac{dP}{P} = \frac{dF}{F} - \frac{dA}{A}.
$$

For small uncertainties, replace differentials with finite uncertainties and consider the worst-case combination. Since the errors are independent and random, use the RSS method:

$$
\left( \frac{\Delta P}{P} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^2,
$$

where the negative sign vanishes upon squaring. Thus:

$$
\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^2 }.
$$

This expression is the relative uncertainty in pressure.

### Problem 27
##### Background
The Doppler effect is a phenomenon where the observed frequency of a wave changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. For sound waves, the observed frequency $ f' $ is given by $ f' = f \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s} $, where $ f $ is the emitted frequency, $ v $ is the speed of sound in the medium, $ v_o $ is the speed of the observer, and $ v_s $ is the speed of the source. The signs $ \pm $ and $ \mp $ depend on the directions of motion: the numerator uses $ + $ if the observer moves toward the source and $ - $ if moving away; the denominator uses $ - $ if the source moves toward the observer and $ + $ if moving away. In an experiment, $ v $, $ v_o $, and $ v_s $ are measured with absolute uncertainties $ \Delta v $, $ \Delta v_o $, and $ \Delta v_s $ respectively, while $ f $ is known exactly.

Given the Doppler frequency formula for sound waves:
$$ f' = f \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s} $$
where $ f $ is known exactly, and $ v $, $ v_o $, $ v_s $ have absolute uncertainties $ \Delta v $, $ \Delta v_o $, $ \Delta v_s $ respectively. The signs $ \pm $ and $ \mp $ are fixed for a specific scenario but retained in symbolic form.  

Derive the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta f' $ in the observed frequency $ f' $. Express $ \Delta f' $ as a single analytic expression in terms of $ f $, $ v $, $ v_o $, $ v_s $, $ \Delta v $, $ \Delta v_o $, $ \Delta v_s $, and the same sign convention as in the given formula for $ f' $.  

Use the standard error propagation formula for a function of independent variables:
$$ \Delta q = \sqrt{ \sum \left( \frac{\partial q}{\partial x_i} \Delta x_i \right)^2 } $$
Ensure your derivation shows all steps, and provide the final expression for $ \Delta f' $.

### Solution
To find the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta f' $ in the observed frequency $ f' = f \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s} $, we treat $ f' $ as a function of three variables: $ v $, $ v_o $, and $ v_s $. The emitted frequency $ f $ is constant and known exactly. The general formula for the absolute uncertainty in $ f' $ is:
$$ \Delta f' = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial f'}{\partial v} \Delta v \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial f'}{\partial v_o} \Delta v_o \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial f'}{\partial v_s} \Delta v_s \right)^2 } $$

Define $ g = \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s} $, so $ f' = f \cdot g $. The partial derivatives are computed as follows:

1. **Partial derivative with respect to $ v $**:
   $$ \frac{\partial g}{\partial v} = \frac{\partial}{\partial v} \left( \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s} \right) $$
   Using the quotient rule, $ \frac{\partial}{\partial v} \left( \frac{u}{w} \right) = \frac{u' w - u w'}{w^2} $ with $ u = v \pm v_o $ and $ w = v \mp v_s $:
   $$ \frac{\partial g}{\partial v} = \frac{ (1)(v \mp v_s) - (v \pm v_o)(1) }{ (v \mp v_s)^2 } = \frac{ v \mp v_s - v \mp v_o }{ (v \mp v_s)^2 } = \frac{ - (\pm v_o + \mp v_s) }{ (v \mp v_s)^2 } $$
   Simplify the term $ \pm v_o + \mp v_s $. Since $ \mp = - (\pm) $, let $ s = \pm $ (so $ \mp = -s $):
   $$ \pm v_o + \mp v_s = s v_o + (-s) v_s = s (v_o - v_s) $$
   Thus:
   $$ \frac{\partial g}{\partial v} = \frac{ - s (v_o - v_s) }{ (v \mp v_s)^2 } $$
   But $ s = \pm $, so:
   $$ \frac{\partial g}{\partial v} = - \frac{ \pm (v_o - v_s) }{ (v \mp v_s)^2 } $$

2. **Partial derivative with respect to $ v_o $**:
   $$ \frac{\partial g}{\partial v_o} = \frac{\partial}{\partial v_o} \left( \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s} \right) = \frac{ \pm 1 \cdot (v \mp v_s) - 0 }{ (v \mp v_s)^2 } = \frac{ \pm 1 }{ v \mp v_s } $$

3. **Partial derivative with respect to $ v_s $**:
   $$ \frac{\partial g}{\partial v_s} = \frac{\partial}{\partial v_s} \left( \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s} \right) = (v \pm v_o) \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial v_s} \left( (v \mp v_s)^{-1} \right) $$
   The derivative is:
   $$ (v \pm v_o) \cdot (-1) (v \mp v_s)^{-2} \cdot (\mp 1) = (v \pm v_o) \cdot (\pm 1) \cdot (v \mp v_s)^{-2} $$
   Since $ \mp = - (\pm) $, and $ - (\mp) = \pm $:
   $$ \frac{\partial g}{\partial v_s} = \frac{ \pm (v \pm v_o) }{ (v \mp v_s)^2 } $$

Now, $ \frac{\partial f'}{\partial v} = f \frac{\partial g}{\partial v} $, $ \frac{\partial f'}{\partial v_o} = f \frac{\partial g}{\partial v_o} $, and $ \frac{\partial f'}{\partial v_s} = f \frac{\partial g}{\partial v_s} $. Substitute into the uncertainty formula:
$$ \Delta f' = \sqrt{ \left( f \cdot \left( - \frac{ \pm (v_o - v_s) }{ (v \mp v_s)^2 } \right) \Delta v \right)^2 + \left( f \cdot \frac{ \pm 1 }{ v \mp v_s } \Delta v_o \right)^2 + \left( f \cdot \frac{ \pm (v \pm v_o) }{ (v \mp v_s)^2 } \Delta v_s \right)^2 } $$

Factor out $ f^2 $ and $ (v \mp v_s)^{-4} $ where possible. Square each term:
$$ \Delta f' = \sqrt{ f^2 \left[ \frac{ \left( \pm (v_o - v_s) \Delta v \right)^2 }{ (v \mp v_s)^4 } + \frac{ \left( \pm \Delta v_o \right)^2 (v \mp v_s)^2 }{ (v \mp v_s)^4 } + \frac{ \left( \pm (v \pm v_o) \Delta v_s \right)^2 }{ (v \mp v_s)^4 } \right] } $$
Since $ (\pm)^2 = 1 $, this simplifies to:
$$ \Delta f' = \frac{f}{ (v \mp v_s)^2 } \sqrt{ (v_o - v_s)^2 (\Delta v)^2 + (\Delta v_o)^2 (v \mp v_s)^2 + (v \pm v_o)^2 (\Delta v_s)^2 } $$

The expression under the square root is:
$$ (v_o - v_s)^2 (\Delta v)^2 + (\Delta v_o)^2 (v \mp v_s)^2 + (v \pm v_o)^2 (\Delta v_s)^2 $$
Note that $ (v_o - v_s)^2 = (v_s - v_o)^2 $, but it is left as is for consistency with the derivation. The final expression for $ \Delta f' $ is:
$$ \Delta f' = \frac{f}{(v \mp v_s)^2} \sqrt{ (v_o - v_s)^2 (\Delta v)^2 + (v \pm v_o)^2 (\Delta v_s)^2 + (\Delta v_o)^2 (v \mp v_s)^2 } $$
This is the absolute uncertainty in $ f' $, with the signs $ \pm $ and $ \mp $ matching those in the original Doppler formula.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{f}{(v \mp v_{s})^{2}} \sqrt{(v_{o} - v_{s})^{2} (\Delta v)^{2} + (v \pm v_{o})^{2} (\Delta v_{s})^{2} + (\Delta v_{o})^{2} (v \mp v_{s})^{2}}}$$

### Problem 28
##### Background
In optics, the refractive index of a material quantifies how much light bends when transitioning between media. It is experimentally determined using Snell's law: $n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r}$, where $i$ is the angle of incidence and $r$ is the angle of refraction, both measured in radians. During measurement, instrumental limitations introduce uncertainties: the angle of incidence is reported as $i \pm \Delta i$, and the angle of refraction as $r \pm \Delta r$, with $\Delta i$ and $\Delta r$ representing absolute uncertainties in radians. Understanding how these uncertainties propagate to the refractive index is essential for assessing measurement reliability in applications like lens design.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Error propagation for a quotient of two functions.
3. Uncertainty propagation through trigonometric functions (sine and cotangent).
4. Partial differentiation of multivariable functions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to the wave model of light (Snell's law) in optics and extends to statistical methods for analyzing experimental errors in physics. It reinforces calculus concepts like derivatives and the chain rule.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Error analysis is fundamental across experimental sciences: in chemistry (concentration measurements), engineering (sensor calibration), and data science (uncertainty quantification in machine learning models). Trigonometric uncertainty propagation also appears in surveying and astronomy.

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate refractive index measurements are critical in designing optical fibers for telecommunications, anti-reflective coatings for camera lenses, and corrective eyewear. For example, a 1% error in $n$ can misalign light paths in fiber optics, causing signal loss.

##### Problem Statement
The refractive index $n$ of a material is calculated as $n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r}$, where $i$ and $r$ are angles measured in radians. The angle of incidence is $i \pm \Delta i$, and the angle of refraction is $r \pm \Delta r$, with $\Delta i$ and $\Delta r$ denoting absolute uncertainties. Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty in $n$, denoted $\frac{\Delta n}{n}$, in terms of $i$, $r$, $\Delta i$, and $\Delta r$. Ensure all trigonometric functions are expressed using standard notation (e.g., $\sin$, $\cot$), and angles are treated as dimensionless quantities in radians. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression.

### Solution
The relative uncertainty in $n$ is given by the error propagation formula for a function of two variables:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta n}{n} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial i} \cdot \frac{\Delta i}{n} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial r} \cdot \frac{\Delta r}{n} \right)^2.
$$
First, compute the partial derivatives of $n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r}$ with respect to $i$ and $r$:
- Differentiating with respect to $i$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial n}{\partial i} = \frac{\partial}{\partial i} \left( \frac{\sin i}{\sin r} \right) = \frac{\cos i}{\sin r}.
  $$
- Differentiating with respect to $r$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial n}{\partial r} = \sin i \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (\sin r)^{-1} = \sin i \cdot (-\csc r \cot r) = -\frac{\sin i \cos r}{\sin^2 r}.
  $$

Next, evaluate the terms $\frac{\partial n}{\partial i} \cdot \frac{\Delta i}{n}$ and $\frac{\partial n}{\partial r} \cdot \frac{\Delta r}{n}$:
- For $i$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial n}{\partial i} \cdot \frac{\Delta i}{n} = \left( \frac{\cos i}{\sin r} \right) \Delta i \cdot \frac{1}{n} = \frac{\cos i}{\sin r} \Delta i \cdot \frac{\sin r}{\sin i} = \frac{\cos i}{\sin i} \Delta i = \cot i \cdot \Delta i.
  $$
- For $r$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial n}{\partial r} \cdot \frac{\Delta r}{n} = \left( -\frac{\sin i \cos r}{\sin^2 r} \right) \Delta r \cdot \frac{1}{n} = -\frac{\sin i \cos r}{\sin^2 r} \Delta r \cdot \frac{\sin r}{\sin i} = -\frac{\cos r}{\sin r} \Delta r = -\cot r \cdot \Delta r.
  $$

Squaring both terms eliminates the negative sign:
$$
\left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial i} \cdot \frac{\Delta i}{n} \right)^2 = (\cot i \cdot \Delta i)^2, \quad
\left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial r} \cdot \frac{\Delta r}{n} \right)^2 = (-\cot r \cdot \Delta r)^2 = (\cot r \cdot \Delta r)^2.
$$

Substitute into the error propagation formula:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta n}{n} \right)^2 = (\cot i \cdot \Delta i)^2 + (\cot r \cdot \Delta r)^2.
$$

Taking the square root gives the relative uncertainty:
$$
\frac{\Delta n}{n} = \sqrt{ (\cot i \cdot \Delta i)^2 + (\cot r \cdot \Delta r)^2 }.
$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \cot i  \cdot \Delta i \right)^{2} + \left( \cot r  \cdot \Delta r \right)^{2} }}$$

### Problem 29
##### Background
In automotive safety testing, engineers measure the impulse delivered to a crash-test dummy during a collision to evaluate injury risk. Impulse $J$ quantifies the change in momentum and is calculated as the product of the average force $F$ applied and the collision duration $\Delta t$. Force is measured as $F \pm \Delta F$, and time duration as $\Delta t \pm \Delta(\Delta t)$, where $\Delta F$ and $\Delta(\Delta t)$ represent absolute uncertainties. These uncertainties arise from sensor limitations and environmental noise.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Definition of impulse and its relationship to force and time.
2. Propagation of absolute uncertainty for a product of independent variables.
3. Application of partial derivatives to derive uncertainty expressions.
4. Construction of a combined uncertainty model from first principles.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- **Mechanics**: Relates to impulse-momentum theorem and force-time integrals.
- **Experimental Physics**: Extends to uncertainty analysis in measurements.
- **Calculus**: Utilizes partial differentiation for error propagation.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Statistics**: Embodies variance composition for independent random variables.
- **Data Science**: Illustrates error aggregation in multiplicative models.

##### Real-World Applications
- Vehicle crash tests: Uncertainty in impulse affects injury probability estimates.
- Sports science: Measuring impact forces in athletic equipment (e.g., helmets).
- Manufacturing: Quality control for impulse-delivering systems (e.g., hammer presses).

##### Problem Statement
The impulse $J$ delivered during a collision is given by $J = F \Delta t$, where $F$ is the force and $\Delta t$ is the time duration. The force measurement is $F \pm \Delta F$, and the time measurement is $\Delta t \pm \Delta(\Delta t)$, with $\Delta F$ and $\Delta(\Delta t)$ denoting absolute uncertainties. Assume $F$ and $\Delta t$ are independent, and their uncertainties are symmetric and uncorrelated.  

Derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta J$ in the impulse. Use the propagation-of-uncertainty method via partial derivatives. Express $\Delta J$ symbolically in terms of $F$, $\Delta t$, $\Delta F$, and $\Delta(\Delta t)$.

### Solution
To determine the absolute uncertainty $\Delta J$ in the impulse $J = F \Delta t$, we apply the propagation-of-uncertainty formula for a function of two independent variables. For $J = g(F, \Delta t)$, the absolute uncertainty is:

$$
\Delta J = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial J}{\partial F} \cdot \Delta F \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial J}{\partial (\Delta t)} \cdot \Delta(\Delta t) \right)^2 }.
$$


First, compute the partial derivative of $J$ with respect to $F$:

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial F} (F \Delta t) = \Delta t.
$$

The term $\Delta t$ is treated as constant because $F$ and $\Delta t$ are independent.

Next, compute the partial derivative of $J$ with respect to $\Delta t$:

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial (\Delta t)} = \frac{\partial}{\partial (\Delta t)} (F \Delta t) = F.
$$

Here, $F$ is constant with respect to $\Delta t$.

Substitute these partial derivatives into the uncertainty formula:

$$
\Delta J = \sqrt{ \left( \Delta t \cdot \Delta F \right)^2 + \left( F \cdot \Delta(\Delta t) \right)^2 }.
$$


Simplify the expression:

$$
\Delta J = \sqrt{ (\Delta t)^2 (\Delta F)^2 + F^2 \left( \Delta(\Delta t) \right)^2 }.
$$


This is the absolute uncertainty in $J$. The derivation assumes independence and small uncertainties, consistent with standard error propagation.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ (\Delta t)^2 (\Delta F)^2 + F^2 \left( \Delta(\Delta t) \right)^2 }}$$

### Problem 3
##### Background
In experimental physics, accurately determining the velocity of an object under constant acceleration requires accounting for measurement uncertainties. The kinematic equation $v = u + at$ relates final velocity $v$ to initial velocity $u$, acceleration $a$, and time $t$. Each measured quantity $u$, $a$, and $t$ has an associated absolute uncertainty: $\Delta u$ for initial velocity, $\Delta a$ for acceleration, and $\Delta t$ for time. These uncertainties propagate through calculations, affecting the certainty of the result.

- Partial derivatives for uncertainty analysis.
- Root-sum-square (RSS) combination of independent uncertainties.
- Algebraic simplification of uncertainty expressions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Uncertainty quantification is essential in fields like meteorology (weather prediction models), economics (risk assessment), and robotics (sensor fusion). It also applies to medical imaging (resolution errors) and environmental science (pollutant dispersion forecasts).

##### Real-World Applications
Engineers use uncertainty analysis to validate safety margins in automotive crash tests (e.g., predicting vehicle velocity from accelerometer data). Aerospace applications include trajectory calculations for spacecraft re-entry, where uncertainties in thrust or timing affect landing precision.

##### Problem Statement
Consider an object moving with constant acceleration. The final velocity $v$ is calculated using $v = u + at$, where $u$, $a$, and $t$ are measured with independent, random uncertainties $\Delta u$, $\Delta a$, and $\Delta t$, respectively. Derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$ in the final velocity. Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $\Delta u$, $\Delta a$, $\Delta t$, $a$, and $t$, simplified to a single square root.  
**Format requirements**:  
- Use the notation $\Delta u$, $\Delta a$, $\Delta t$, $a$, and $t$ exactly as defined.  
- Write all terms inside the square root explicitly.  
- Do **not** substitute numerical values or constants.

### Solution
To find the absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$ in $v = u + at$, treat $v$ as a function of three independent variables: $u$, $a$, and $t$. The general formula for the absolute uncertainty when variables are independent is:

$$
\Delta v = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial u} \Delta u \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial a} \Delta a \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} \Delta t \right)^2 }.
$$


First, compute the partial derivatives of $v$ with respect to each variable:
- $\frac{\partial v}{\partial u} = 1$ (since $v = u + at$ depends linearly on $u$),
- $\frac{\partial v}{\partial a} = t$ (since $v = u + at$ treats $a$ as a coefficient of $t$),
- $\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = a$ (since $v = u + at$ treats $t$ as a coefficient of $a$).

Substitute these derivatives into the uncertainty formula:

$$
\Delta v = \sqrt{ (1 \cdot \Delta u)^2 + (t \cdot \Delta a)^2 + (a \cdot \Delta t)^2 }.
$$


Simplify the expression:

$$
\Delta v = \sqrt{ (\Delta u)^2 + (t \Delta a)^2 + (a \Delta t)^2 }.
$$


This is the final expression for the absolute uncertainty in $v$. The derivation assumes independent uncertainties, as stated in the problem.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ (\Delta u)^2 + (t \Delta a)^2 + (a \Delta t)^2 }}$$

##### Problem Statement
A physics experiment measures a constant force $F$ with absolute uncertainty $\Delta F$ acting on an object displaced by distance $d$ with absolute uncertainty $\Delta d$. The work done is calculated as $W = F d$. Assume $F$ and $d$ are uncorrelated measured quantities. Derive the expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta W$ in the work calculation. Express $\Delta W$ symbolically in terms of $F$, $\Delta F$, $d$, and $\Delta d$ using the root-sum-square method for independent uncertainties. Provide your final answer as a single simplified expression.

### Solution
To determine the absolute uncertainty $\Delta W$ in the work $W = F d$, we use the general error propagation formula for a function of multiple variables. For $W(F, d)$, the uncertainty is:

$$\Delta W = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial W}{\partial F} \Delta F \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial W}{\partial d} \Delta d \right)^2 }$$

Calculate the partial derivatives of $W$ with respect to each variable:
- $\frac{\partial W}{\partial F} = d$ (treating $d$ as constant)
- $\frac{\partial W}{\partial d} = F$ (treating $F$ as constant)

Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:
$$\Delta W = \sqrt{ \left( d \cdot \Delta F \right)^2 + \left( F \cdot \Delta d \right)^2 }$$

Simplify the expression under the square root:
$$\Delta W = \sqrt{ d^2 (\Delta F)^2 + F^2 (\Delta d)^2 }$$

This is the simplified form for the absolute uncertainty in $W$. The derivation assumes $F$ and $d$ are independent, as stated in the problem, which justifies using the root-sum-square method without covariance terms.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ F^{2} \left( \Delta d \right)^{2} + d^{2} \left( \Delta F \right)^{2} }}$$

### Problem 31

##### Problem Statement
Consider an object with mass $ m $ and velocity $ v $, where the absolute uncertainties in these measurements are $ \Delta m $ and $ \Delta v $, respectively. The momentum is given by $ p = mv $. Assuming the uncertainties in mass and velocity are independent and uncorrelated, derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta p $ in the momentum. Express $ \Delta p $ symbolically in terms of $ m $, $ v $, $ \Delta m $, and $ \Delta v $.  
*Reminder: Use the standard propagation formula for independent variables.*

### Solution
To find the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta p $ in the momentum $ p = mv $, we apply the root-sum-square formula for the propagation of uncertainties in independent variables. For a function $ f(x, y) $, the absolute uncertainty is:  
$$ \Delta f = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \Delta x \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \Delta y \right)^2 } $$  
Here, $ f \equiv p $, $ x \equiv m $, and $ y \equiv v $.  

**Step 1: Compute partial derivatives**  
The partial derivative of $ p $ with respect to mass $ m $ is:  
$$ \frac{\partial p}{\partial m} = \frac{\partial}{\partial m}(mv) = v $$  
The partial derivative of $ p $ with respect to velocity $ v $ is:  
$$ \frac{\partial p}{\partial v} = \frac{\partial}{\partial v}(mv) = m $$  

**Step 2: Substitute into uncertainty formula**  
Using the partial derivatives and given uncertainties $ \Delta m $ and $ \Delta v $:  
$$ \Delta p = \sqrt{ \left( v \cdot \Delta m \right)^2 + \left( m \cdot \Delta v \right)^2 } $$  

**Step 3: Simplify the expression**  
Rewrite the terms inside the square root:  
$$ \Delta p = \sqrt{ v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + m^2 (\Delta v)^2 } $$  
This is the symbolic expression for the absolute uncertainty in momentum.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ v^{2} (\Delta m)^{2} + m^{2} (\Delta v)^{2} }}$$

##### Problem Statement
The buoyant force $F_b$ on a submerged object is given by $F_b = \rho V g$, where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $V$ is the displaced volume, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (known exactly). The density is measured as $\rho \pm \Delta \rho$, and the volume as $V \pm \Delta V$, with $\Delta \rho$ and $\Delta V$ representing absolute uncertainties. Assume $\rho$, $V$, $\Delta \rho$, and $\Delta V$ are positive, and the uncertainties in $\rho$ and $V$ are independent.

Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty in the buoyant force, $\frac{\Delta F_b}{F_b}$. Express your answer in terms of the relative uncertainties $\frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho}$ and $\frac{\Delta V}{V}$.

**Answer Format Requirements**

- Omit units, as the answer is a dimensionless relative uncertainty.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta F_b}{F_b}$, we start with the formula for buoyant force:
$$ F_b = \rho V g. $$
Since $g$ is constant and known exactly, it has no uncertainty. The uncertainties in $\rho$ and $V$ are independent, so we use error propagation for a product. The absolute uncertainty $\Delta F_b$ is given by:
$$ \Delta F_b = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial F_b}{\partial \rho} \Delta \rho \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial F_b}{\partial V} \Delta V \right)^2 }. $$

Compute the partial derivatives:
$$ \frac{\partial F_b}{\partial \rho} = V g, \quad \frac{\partial F_b}{\partial V} = \rho g. $$
Substitute these into the expression for $\Delta F_b$:
$$ \Delta F_b = \sqrt{ (V g \cdot \Delta \rho)^2 + (\rho g \cdot \Delta V)^2 }. $$
Factor out $g$:
$$ \Delta F_b = g \sqrt{ (V \Delta \rho)^2 + (\rho \Delta V)^2 }. $$

The relative uncertainty is:
$$ \frac{\Delta F_b}{F_b} = \frac{ g \sqrt{ (V \Delta \rho)^2 + (\rho \Delta V)^2 } }{ \rho V g }. $$
Cancel $g$ (since $g \neq 0$):
$$ \frac{\Delta F_b}{F_b} = \frac{ \sqrt{ (V \Delta \rho)^2 + (\rho \Delta V)^2 } }{ \rho V }. $$

Rewrite the expression under the square root:
$$ (V \Delta \rho)^2 + (\rho \Delta V)^2 = V^2 (\Delta \rho)^2 + \rho^2 (\Delta V)^2. $$
Divide by $(\rho V)^2$:
$$ \frac{\Delta F_b}{F_b} = \sqrt{ \frac{ V^2 (\Delta \rho)^2 + \rho^2 (\Delta V)^2 }{ (\rho V)^2 } } = \sqrt{ \frac{ V^2 (\Delta \rho)^2 }{ \rho^2 V^2 } + \frac{ \rho^2 (\Delta V)^2 }{ \rho^2 V^2 } } = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 }. $$

Thus, the relative uncertainty in $F_b$ is the square root of the sum of the squares of the relative uncertainties in $\rho$ and $V$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 } }$$

### Problem 33
##### Background
In electrical engineering, the power dissipated in a resistor is given by $P = I^2 R$, where $I$ is the current and $R$ is the resistance. Experimental measurements of $I$ and $R$ always have inherent uncertainties, denoted as $\Delta I$ and $\Delta R$ respectively. To quantify the reliability of calculated power, we must determine how these uncertainties propagate through the equation. The relative uncertainty $\left( \frac{\Delta P}{P} \right)$ expresses the fractional error in power.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Error propagation for multiplicative and power functions  
2. Partial derivatives in uncertainty analysis  
3. Combining relative uncertainties using root-sum-square (RSS) methods  
4. Interpretation of relative uncertainty as a dimensionless quantity  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
- **Direct proportionality**: Relates to Ohm's law ($V = IR$) and power relationships.  
- **Measurement techniques**: Connects to instrumentation precision in current and resistance measurements.  
- **Dimensional analysis**: Ensures consistency of uncertainty expressions.  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Statistics**: RSS method originates from variance addition in independent random variables.  
- **Engineering design**: Critical for safety margins in electrical systems (e.g., power supply tolerances).  
- **Data science**: Similar error propagation used in machine learning regression models.

2. **Renewable energy**: Predicts uncertainty in solar panel output calculations based on current/resistance measurements.  
3. **Laboratory experiments**: Standard protocol for reporting confidence intervals in physics/engineering journals.  

##### Problem Statement
The power dissipated in a resistor is modeled as $P = I^2 R$, where current $I$ and resistance $R$ are measured with uncertainties $\Delta I$ and $\Delta R$. Assume $\Delta I$ and $\Delta R$ are independent and random. Derive an analytic expression for the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$ in terms of $I$, $\Delta I$, $R$, and $\Delta R$. Express your final answer as a single simplified expression under a square root.

### Solution
##### Step 1: General formula for uncertainty propagation  
For a function $P(I, R)$, the absolute uncertainty $\Delta P$ is given by:  
$$\Delta P = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial I} \Delta I \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial R} \Delta R \right)^2 }$$  
This assumes uncorrelated errors and first-order Taylor approximation.  

##### Step 2: Compute partial derivatives  
Given $P = I^2 R$:  
- Partial derivative with respect to $I$:  
  $$\frac{\partial P}{\partial I} = 2IR$$  
- Partial derivative with respect to $R$:  
  $$\frac{\partial P}{\partial R} = I^2$$  

##### Step 3: Substitute into uncertainty formula  
$$\Delta P = \sqrt{ \left( 2IR \cdot \Delta I \right)^2 + \left( I^2 \cdot \Delta R \right)^2 }$$  

##### Step 4: Simplify the expression  
Factor out common terms:  
$$\Delta P = \sqrt{ (2IR \Delta I)^2 + (I^2 \Delta R)^2 } = \sqrt{ 4I^2 R^2 (\Delta I)^2 + I^4 (\Delta R)^2 }$$  
Extract $I^2$ from the square root:  
$$\Delta P = I \sqrt{ 4 R^2 (\Delta I)^2 + I^2 (\Delta R)^2 }$$  

##### Step 5: Compute relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$  
Substitute $P = I^2 R$:  
$$\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{I \sqrt{ 4 R^2 (\Delta I)^2 + I^2 (\Delta R)^2 }}{I^2 R} = \frac{ \sqrt{ 4 R^2 (\Delta I)^2 + I^2 (\Delta R)^2 } }{I R}$$  
Simplify the fraction:  
$$\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \sqrt{ \frac{ 4 R^2 (\Delta I)^2 + I^2 (\Delta R)^2 }{ I^2 R^2 } } = \sqrt{ \frac{4 R^2 (\Delta I)^2}{I^2 R^2} + \frac{I^2 (\Delta R)^2}{I^2 R^2} }$$  
Reduce each term:  
$$\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \sqrt{ 4 \left( \frac{\Delta I}{I} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta R}{R} \right)^2 }$$  

##### Step 6: Final simplified form  
The expression is already compact. No further simplification is needed.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{4 \left( \frac{\Delta I}{I} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta R}{R} \right)^2}}$$

### Problem 34
##### Background  
Magnetic flux, denoted by $\Phi$, is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism that quantifies the amount of magnetic field passing through a given surface area. It is defined as $\Phi = BA\cos\theta$, where $B$ is the magnetic field magnitude, $A$ is the area of the surface perpendicular to the field, and $\theta$ is the angle between the magnetic field vector and the normal to the surface. In experimental physics, measurements of $B$, $A$, and $\theta$ inherently carry uncertainties due to instrument limitations or environmental factors. Understanding how these individual uncertainties propagate to the overall uncertainty in $\Phi$ is crucial for reliable data interpretation and scientific reporting.  

##### Knowledge Points Tested

- Understanding the root-sum-square method for combining independent uncertainties.  
- Trigonometric identities and simplification of expressions involving $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Engineering**: Directly applicable to sensor design (e.g., Hall effect sensors) where precision in magnetic field measurements is critical.  
- **Data Science**: Illustrates foundational principles for uncertainty quantification in predictive modeling.  

##### Real-World Applications  
- Calibrating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines to ensure accurate diagnostics.  
- Designing electric motors and generators, where flux uncertainty affects efficiency calculations.  
- Space weather monitoring (e.g., satellite instruments measuring solar wind magnetic fields).  

##### Problem Statement  
A laboratory experiment measures the magnetic flux $\Phi = BA\cos\theta$ through a rectangular loop. The measured values and their absolute uncertainties are:  
- Magnetic field: $B \pm \Delta B$  
- Area: $A \pm \Delta A$  
- Angle: $\theta \pm \Delta \theta$ (in radians).  

Assume $B$, $A$, and $\theta$ are independent random variables with $\Delta B$, $\Delta A$, and $\Delta \theta$ representing standard deviations. Derive the analytic expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta\Phi$ in the magnetic flux $\Phi$. Express $\Delta\Phi$ symbolically in terms of $B$, $A$, $\theta$, $\Delta B$, $\Delta A$, and $\Delta \theta$.

### Solution
To derive the absolute uncertainty $\Delta\Phi$ in $\Phi = BA\cos\theta$, we use the root-sum-square formula for error propagation in independent variables:  

$$
\Delta\Phi = \sqrt{
  \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial B} \cdot \Delta B \right)^2 +
  \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial A} \cdot \Delta A \right)^2 +
  \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \theta} \cdot \Delta \theta \right)^2
}.
$$

**Step 1: Compute partial derivatives**  
- Partial derivative with respect to $B$:  
  $$
  \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial B} = A \cos\theta.
  $$
- Partial derivative with respect to $A$:  
  $$
  \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial A} = B \cos\theta.
  $$
- Partial derivative with respect to $\theta$:  
  $$
  \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \theta} = BA \cdot (-\sin\theta) = -BA \sin\theta.
  $$

**Step 2: Substitute into the root-sum-square formula**  
$$
\Delta\Phi = \sqrt{
  \left( (A \cos\theta) \cdot \Delta B \right)^2 +
  \left( (B \cos\theta) \cdot \Delta A \right)^2 +
  \left( (-BA \sin\theta) \cdot \Delta \theta \right)^2
}.
$$

**Step 3: Simplify the expression**  
Since squaring eliminates the negative sign:  
$$
\Delta\Phi = \sqrt{
  (A \cos\theta \cdot \Delta B)^2 + 
  (B \cos\theta \cdot \Delta A)^2 + 
  (BA \sin\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2
}.
$$

Factor out common terms:  
$$
\Delta\Phi = \sqrt{
  A^2 \cos^2\theta \cdot (\Delta B)^2 + 
  B^2 \cos^2\theta \cdot (\Delta A)^2 + 
  B^2 A^2 \sin^2\theta \cdot (\Delta \theta)^2
}.
$$

This is the simplified analytic expression for $\Delta\Phi$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ A^{2} \cos^{2}{\theta} \cdot (\Delta B)^{2} + B^{2} \cos^{2}{\theta} \cdot (\Delta A)^{2} + B^{2} A^{2} \sin^{2}{\theta} \cdot (\Delta \theta)^{2} }}$$

### Problem 35
##### Background
In experimental physics and engineering, efficiency is a critical parameter defined as the ratio of useful output power to input power. When measuring power, uncertainties arise from instrument precision and random fluctuations. Consider a scenario where a researcher measures the efficiency $\eta$ of an energy conversion system, such as a wind turbine or a photovoltaic cell. The output power $P_{\text{out}}$ is measured with an absolute uncertainty $\Delta P_{\text{out}}$, and the input power $P_{\text{in}}$ with an absolute uncertainty $\Delta P_{\text{in}}$. The uncertainties are independent and random. Understanding how these uncertainties propagate to the efficiency is essential for evaluating system performance.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Error propagation for a quotient of two measured quantities.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications

- Validating fuel efficiency claims in automotive engineering.
- Calibrating medical imaging devices where input/output power ratios determine diagnostic accuracy.

##### Problem Statement
The efficiency $\eta$ of a system is defined as $\eta = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}}$, where $P_{\text{out}}$ is the output power and $P_{\text{in}}$ is the input power. The measured values are $P_{\text{out}} \pm \Delta P_{\text{out}}$ and $P_{\text{in}} \pm \Delta P_{\text{in}}$, with independent uncertainties. Derive the expression for the **relative uncertainty** $\frac{\Delta \eta}{\eta}$ in terms of the relative uncertainties of $P_{\text{out}}$ and $P_{\text{in}}$.  

Express your answer as an analytic expression using $\Delta P_{\text{out}}$, $P_{\text{out}}$, $\Delta P_{\text{in}}$, and $P_{\text{in}}$.  
**Note**: The relative uncertainty of a quantity $x$ is defined as $\frac{\Delta x}{|x|}$. Assume $P_{\text{out}} > 0$ and $P_{\text{in}} > 0$.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty in $\eta$, start with the definition of efficiency:  
$$\eta = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}}.$$  
The absolute uncertainty $\Delta \eta$ is derived from the error propagation formula for a quotient. For a function $z = \frac{x}{y}$, the uncertainty is:  
$$(\Delta z)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \Delta x \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \Delta y \right)^2.$$  
Here, $x = P_{\text{out}}$, $y = P_{\text{in}}$, and $z = \eta$.  

**Step 1**: Compute partial derivatives of $\eta$.  
- Partial derivative with respect to $P_{\text{out}}$:  
  $$\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial P_{\text{out}}} = \frac{1}{P_{\text{in}}}}.$$  
- Partial derivative with respect to $P_{\text{in}}$:  
  $$\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial P_{\text{in}}} = -\frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}^2}.$$  

**Step 2**: Substitute into the error propagation formula:  
$$(\Delta \eta)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{P_{\text{in}}}} \Delta P_{\text{out}} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}^2} \Delta P_{\text{in}} \right)^2.$$  
Simplify:  
$$(\Delta \eta)^2 = \frac{(\Delta P_{\text{out}})^2}{P_{\text{in}}^2} + \frac{P_{\text{out}}^2 (\Delta P_{\text{in}})^2}{P_{\text{in}}^4}.$$  

**Step 3**: Express in terms of relative uncertainties.  
The relative uncertainty of $\eta$ is $\frac{\Delta \eta}{\eta}$. Square it:  
$$\left( \frac{\Delta \eta}{\eta} \right)^2 = \frac{(\Delta \eta)^2}{\eta^2}.$$  
Substitute $\eta = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}}}$:  
$$\eta^2 = \left( \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}}} \right)^2 = \frac{P_{\text{out}}^2}{P_{\text{in}}^2}.$$  
Thus:  
$$\left( \frac{\Delta \eta}{\eta} \right)^2 = (\Delta \eta)^2 \cdot \frac{P_{\text{in}}^2}{P_{\text{out}}^2}.$$  
Substitute the expression for $(\Delta \eta)^2$ from Step 2:  
$$\left( \frac{\Delta \eta}{\eta} \right)^2 = \left[ \frac{(\Delta P_{\text{out}})^2}{P_{\text{in}}^2} + \frac{P_{\text{out}}^2 (\Delta P_{\text{in}})^2}{P_{\text{in}}^4} \right] \cdot \frac{P_{\text{in}}^2}{P_{\text{out}}^2}.$$  
Simplify:  
$$\left( \frac{\Delta \eta}{\eta} \right)^2 = \frac{(\Delta P_{\text{out}})^2}{P_{\text{out}}^2} + \frac{(\Delta P_{\text{in}})^2}{P_{\text{in}}^2}.$$  
Recognize that $\frac{\Delta P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{out}}}}$ is the relative uncertainty in $P_{\text{out}}$, and $\frac{\Delta P_{\text{in}}}{P_{\text{in}}}}$ is the relative uncertainty in $P_{\text{in}}$.  

**Step 4**: Take the square root to obtain the relative uncertainty:  
$$\frac{\Delta \eta}{\eta} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{out}}}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta P_{\text{in}}}{P_{\text{in}}}} \right)^2 }.$$  
This is the final expression for the relative uncertainty in $\eta$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{out}}}} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta P_{\text{in}}}{P_{\text{in}}}} \right)^{2} } }$$

### Problem 36
##### Background
In materials science, strain quantifies the deformation of an object under applied stress. It is defined as the ratio of the change in length ($\Delta L$) to the original length ($L$). Experimental measurements always involve uncertainties: the change in length is measured as $\Delta L \pm \Delta(\Delta L)$, and the original length as $L \pm \Delta L$. To accurately interpret results, scientists must quantify how these uncertainties propagate to the calculated strain.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Definition of relative uncertainty.
- Error propagation for a quotient of two measured quantities.
- Application of partial derivatives in uncertainty analysis.
- Interpretation of independent measurement errors.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to the broader study of measurement theory in physics, elasticity in mechanics, and statistical analysis of experimental data. It reinforces the principle that uncertainties combine geometrically for multiplicative relationships.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Uncertainty propagation is essential in engineering (structural integrity assessments), environmental science (ground deformation monitoring), and metrology (precision instrument calibration). The mathematical framework also appears in economics (sensitivity analysis) and epidemiology (error in rate calculations).

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate strain uncertainty analysis ensures safety in civil engineering (bridge load testing), aerospace (wing stress simulations), and medical devices (stent expansion tolerances). For example, underestimating strain uncertainty in tectonic plate monitoring could lead to inaccurate earthquake risk assessments.

##### Problem Statement
The strain $\epsilon$ of a material is given by $\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$, where $\Delta L$ is the change in length with absolute uncertainty $\Delta(\Delta L)$, and $L$ is the original length with absolute uncertainty $\Delta L$. Assume $\Delta L$ and $L$ are measured independently. Derive an expression for the **relative uncertainty in the strain**, denoted as $\frac{\Delta \epsilon}{\epsilon}$, in terms of $\Delta L$, $\Delta(\Delta L)$, and $L$. Express your answer as a single analytic expression using only these variables.

### Solution
The strain is defined as:
$$ \epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L} $$

The relative uncertainty in $\epsilon$ is:
$$ \frac{\Delta \epsilon}{\epsilon} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial (\Delta L)} \cdot \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\epsilon} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial L} \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{\epsilon} \right)^2 } $$

First, compute the partial derivatives of $\epsilon$ with respect to $\Delta L$ and $L$:
$$ \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial (\Delta L)} = \frac{1}{L}, \quad \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial L} = -\frac{\Delta L}{L^2} $$

Substitute these into the relative uncertainty formula:
$$ \frac{\Delta \epsilon}{\epsilon} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{1}{L} \cdot \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\epsilon} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{\Delta L}{L^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{\epsilon} \right)^2 } $$

Simplify the terms inside the square root. For the first term:
$$ \frac{1}{L} \cdot \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\epsilon} = \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{L \epsilon} $$
For the second term:
$$ -\frac{\Delta L}{L^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{\epsilon} = -\frac{(\Delta L)^2}{L^2 \epsilon} $$

Since $\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$, substitute this expression:
$$ \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{L \epsilon} = \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{L \cdot (\Delta L / L)} = \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\Delta L} $$
$$ -\frac{(\Delta L)^2}{L^2 \epsilon} = -\frac{(\Delta L)^2}{L^2 \cdot (\Delta L / L)} = -\frac{\Delta L}{L} $$

The squared terms eliminate the negative sign:
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\Delta L} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 $$

Thus, the relative uncertainty is:
$$ \frac{\Delta \epsilon}{\epsilon} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\Delta L} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 } $$

This expression shows that the relative uncertainty in strain is the root-sum-square of the relative uncertainty in $\Delta L$ and the relative uncertainty in $L$.

### Answer
$$ \boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\Delta L} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^{2} } } $$

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

##### Real-World Applications

- Estimating uncertainties in exoplanet mass determinations from radial velocity measurements.
- Validating orbital models for Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.

##### Problem Statement
The orbital velocity $v$ of a satellite is given by $v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant (known exactly), $M$ is the mass of the central body with uncertainty $\Delta M$, and $r$ is the orbital radius with uncertainty $\Delta r$. Assume $\Delta M$ and $\Delta r$ are independent. Derive an analytic expression for the **relative uncertainty in $v$**, denoted $\frac{\Delta v}{v}$, in terms of the relative uncertainties $\frac{\Delta M}{M}$ and $\frac{\Delta r}{r}$. Express your final answer using the notation $\frac{\Delta v}{v} = \text{[expression]}$.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta v}{v}$, we start with the orbital velocity equation:
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} $$
Rewrite this as a power-law expression for easier differentiation:
$$ v = (GM)^{1/2} r^{-1/2} $$

The relative uncertainty for a function $v(M, r)$ is derived using the root-sum-square rule for independent uncertainties:
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial M} \cdot \frac{\Delta M}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial r} \cdot \frac{\Delta r}{v} \right)^2 $$

First, compute the partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $M$:
$$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial M} = \frac{\partial}{\partial M} \left[ (GM)^{1/2} r^{-1/2} \right] = \frac{1}{2} (GM)^{-1/2} G r^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{v}{M} $$
since $v = (GM)^{1/2} r^{-1/2}$. This simplifies to:
$$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial M} = \frac{v}{2M} $$

Next, compute the partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $r$:
$$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial r} = \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left[ (GM)^{1/2} r^{-1/2} \right] = (GM)^{1/2} \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} r^{-3/2} \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{v}{r} $$
since $v = (GM)^{1/2} r^{-1/2}$. This simplifies to:
$$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial r} = -\frac{v}{2r} $$

Substitute these partial derivatives into the root-sum-square formula:
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{v}{2M} \cdot \frac{\Delta M}{v} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{v}{2r} \cdot \frac{\Delta r}{v} \right)^2 $$
Simplify each term:
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta M}{2M} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{\Delta r}{2r} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta M}{2M} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta r}{2r} \right)^2 $$
The negative sign vanishes due to squaring. Factor out $\frac{1}{4}$:
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{\Delta M}{M} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \left[ \left( \frac{\Delta M}{M} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 \right] $$

Take the square root of both sides to solve for $\frac{\Delta v}{v}$:
$$ \frac{\Delta v}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta M}{M} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 } $$
This is the relative uncertainty in $v$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \left( \dfrac{\Delta M}{M} \right)^{2} + \left( \dfrac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^{2} }}$$

Use **only** the symbols $V$, $\Delta V$, $d$, and $\Delta d$ in your final expression. Ensure the result is simplified and expressed as a single closed-form analytic expression.

**Format Requirements**:
- Use standard LaTeX notation (e.g., $\sqrt{x}$, $\frac{a}{b}$).
- Express all derivatives explicitly (e.g., $\frac{\partial E}{\partial V}$).
- Omit units in the final answer.

### Solution
The absolute uncertainty $\Delta E$ is derived using the error propagation formula for a function of multiple variables. For $E(V, d) = V/d$:

1. **Partial Derivatives**:  
   - Derivative with respect to $V$:  
     $$
     \frac{\partial E}{\partial V} = \frac{1}{d}
     $$  
   - Derivative with respect to $d$:  
     $$
     \frac{\partial E}{\partial d} = -\frac{V}{d^2}
     $$

2. **Error Propagation Formula**:  
   For independent uncertainties, $\Delta E$ is the root-sum-square of the products of partial derivatives and individual uncertainties:  
   $$
   \Delta E = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial V} \Delta V \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial d} \Delta d \right)^2 }
   $$

3. **Substitute Derivatives**:  
   $$
   \Delta E = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{1}{d} \cdot \Delta V \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{V}{d^2} \cdot \Delta d \right)^2 }
   $$

4. **Simplify the Expression**:  
   Square each term:  
   $$
   \Delta E = \sqrt{ \frac{(\Delta V)^2}{d^2} + \frac{V^2 (\Delta d)^2}{d^4} }
   $$  
   Factor out $1/d^2$:  
   $$
   \Delta E = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{d^2} \left( (\Delta V)^2 + \frac{V^2 (\Delta d)^2}{d^2} \right) }
   $$  
   Combine terms under a common denominator:  
   $$
   \Delta E = \frac{1}{d^2} \sqrt{ d^2 (\Delta V)^2 + V^2 (\Delta d)^2 }
   $$

5. **Final Expression**:  
   The absolute uncertainty in $E$ is:  
   $$
   \Delta E = \frac{ \sqrt{ (d \Delta V)^2 + (V \Delta d)^2 } }{d^2}
   $$

### Answer
$$
\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{\left(d \Delta V\right)^{2} + \left(V \Delta d\right)^{2}}}{d^{2}}}
$$

### Problem 39
##### Background
In nuclear physics, the half-life $T_{1/2}$ of a radioactive isotope quantifies the time required for half of a sample to decay. This property is linked to the decay constant $\lambda$ through the relation $T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}$. Experimental measurements of $\lambda$ inherently carry uncertainty, denoted as $\Delta \lambda$. Understanding how this uncertainty propagates to $T_{1/2}$ is essential for assessing the reliability of half-life determinations in applications like radiometric dating and nuclear medicine.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Propagation of uncertainty for a function of a single variable.
- Calculation of relative uncertainty.
- Differentiation of inverse functions.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to exponential decay models in physics and calculus-based error analysis in experimental physics. It reinforces the interplay between mathematical derivatives and physical interpretations of uncertainty.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Uncertainty propagation is fundamental in chemistry (reaction kinetics), engineering (sensor measurements), and environmental science (pollutant decay modeling). The mathematical framework applies broadly to any inverse relationship in experimental data.

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate uncertainty quantification for half-life is critical in carbon-14 dating (archaeology), cancer treatment (radiation dose calibration), and nuclear waste management (decay rate predictions).

##### Problem Statement
The half-life of a radioactive isotope is given by $T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}$, where $\lambda$ is the decay constant. If $\lambda$ has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta \lambda$, derive the relative uncertainty in the half-life, $\frac{\Delta T_{1/2}}{T_{1/2}}$. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $\lambda$ and $\Delta \lambda$.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta T_{1/2}}{T_{1/2}}$, we use error propagation for a function of one variable. The absolute uncertainty $\Delta T_{1/2}$ is approximated by:
$$
\Delta T_{1/2} \approx \left| \frac{dT_{1/2}}{d\lambda} \right| \Delta \lambda
$$

First, compute the derivative of $T_{1/2}$ with respect to $\lambda$. Given:
$$
T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda} = (\ln 2) \cdot \lambda^{-1}
$$
The derivative is:
$$
\frac{dT_{1/2}}{d\lambda} = (\ln 2) \cdot (-1) \cdot \lambda^{-2} = -\frac{\ln 2}{\lambda^2}
$$

Thus, the absolute uncertainty in $T_{1/2}$ is:
$$
\Delta T_{1/2} \approx \left| -\frac{\ln 2}{\lambda^2} \right| \Delta \lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda^2} \Delta \lambda
$$

The relative uncertainty is:
$$
\frac{\Delta T_{1/2}}{T_{1/2}} = \frac{ \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda^2} \Delta \lambda }{ \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda} } = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda^2} \Delta \lambda \cdot \frac{\lambda}{\ln 2}
$$

Simplifying the expression:
$$
\frac{\Delta T_{1/2}}{T_{1/2}} = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}
$$

Therefore, the relative uncertainty in $T_{1/2}$ equals the relative uncertainty in $\lambda$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}}$$

### Problem 4
##### Background
In manufacturing and quality control, precise measurements are critical. Consider a cubic component used in a mechanical assembly. The side length of the cube is measured as $ a \pm \Delta a $, where $ \Delta a $ represents the absolute uncertainty in the measurement. To ensure the component fits correctly, the volume must be calculated, and its uncertainty quantified. The relative uncertainty—defined as the ratio of absolute uncertainty to the measured value—provides insight into measurement reliability.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

##### Real-World Applications

- **Aerospace**: Verifying fuel tank dimensions for spacecraft to ensure precise propellant loading.

##### Problem Statement
A machinist measures the side length of a metal cube as $ a \pm \Delta a $. The volume $ V $ of the cube is a function of the side length $ a $. Derive an analytic expression for the **relative uncertainty** in the volume, $ \frac{\Delta V}{V} $, in terms of $ a $ and $ \Delta a $. Assume $ \Delta a \ll a $ and that uncertainties propagate according to standard derivative-based methods. Express your final answer as a simplified symbolic expression using only the given parameters.

### Solution
To determine the relative uncertainty in the volume, we start with the formula for the volume of a cube:  
$$ V = a^3 $$  

The absolute uncertainty $ \Delta V $ is derived using error propagation for a function of a single variable. For $ V = f(a) $, the absolute uncertainty is:  
$$ \Delta V = \left| \frac{dV}{da} \right| \Delta a $$  

Compute the derivative of $ V $ with respect to $ a $:  
$$ \frac{dV}{da} = \frac{d}{da}(a^3) = 3a^2 $$  

Substitute this into the uncertainty formula:  
$$ \Delta V = \left| 3a^2 \right| \Delta a = 3a^2 \Delta a \quad (\text{since $ a > 0 $)} $$  

The relative uncertainty $ \frac{\Delta V}{V} $ is the ratio of $ \Delta V $ to $ V $:  
$$ \frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{3a^2 \Delta a}{a^3} = \frac{3 \Delta a}{a} $$  

This simplifies to:  
$$ \frac{\Delta V}{V} = 3 \left( \frac{\Delta a}{a} \right) $$  

The expression $ 3 \frac{\Delta a}{a} $ is the relative uncertainty in the volume.

### Answer
$$\boxed{3 \frac{\Delta a}{a}}$$

### Problem 40
##### Background
In physics experiments involving projectile motion, the maximum height $ H $ reached by an object is a key parameter. The theoretical model relates $ H $ to the initial speed $ v $, launch angle $ \theta $, and gravitational acceleration $ g $. However, real-world measurements of $ v $ and $ \theta $ have inherent uncertainties due to instrument limitations or environmental factors. These uncertainties propagate to the calculated value of $ H $. Understanding how small errors in inputs affect the output is essential for experimental design and data analysis in fields ranging from sports science to aerospace engineering.

- **Meteorology**: Uncertainty analysis applies to predicting projectile paths in variable wind conditions.
- **Data Science**: Demonstrates how input errors propagate in mathematical models.

##### Real-World Applications

2. **Sports analytics**: Quantifying how small variations in a basketball player's release speed or angle affect the peak height of a shot.
3. **Physics education labs**: Common experiment to teach uncertainty principles using a projectile launcher.

##### Problem Statement
The maximum height $ H $ of a projectile is modeled as:
$$ H = \frac{v^2 \sin^2\theta}{2g} $$
where:
- $ v $ is the initial speed with measured uncertainty $ \Delta v $,
- $ \theta $ is the launch angle (in radians) with measured uncertainty $ \Delta \theta $,
- $ g $ is a known constant (acceleration due to gravity) with negligible uncertainty.

Derive an expression for the **relative uncertainty** in $ H $, denoted $\frac{\Delta H}{H}$, in terms of $ v $, $ \theta $, $ \Delta v $, and $ \Delta \theta $.  
**Express your answer as an analytic expression using the given symbols.** Assume uncertainties are independent and small.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta H}{H}$, apply error propagation for independent variables:
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta H}{H} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial H}{\partial v} \cdot \frac{\Delta v}{H} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial H}{\partial \theta} \cdot \frac{\Delta \theta}{H} \right)^2 $$
**Step 1: Compute partial derivatives**  
Given $ H = \frac{v^2 \sin^2\theta}{2g} $:  
- Derivative w.r.t. $ v $:  
  $$ \frac{\partial H}{\partial v} = \frac{2v \sin^2\theta}{2g} = \frac{v \sin^2\theta}{g} $$  
- Derivative w.r.t. $ \theta $ (using chain rule and $\frac{d}{d\theta}\sin^2\theta = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta$):  
  $$ \frac{\partial H}{\partial \theta} = \frac{v^2}{2g} \cdot 2\sin\theta\cos\theta = \frac{v^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta}{g} $$  

**Step 2: Compute each term in the uncertainty sum**  
- First term:  
  $$ \frac{\partial H}{\partial v} \cdot \frac{\Delta v}{H} = \left( \frac{v \sin^2\theta}{g} \right) \cdot \frac{\Delta v}{H} $$  
  Substitute $ H = \frac{v^2 \sin^2\theta}{2g} $:  
  $$ = \frac{v \sin^2\theta}{g} \cdot \frac{\Delta v}{\frac{v^2 \sin^2\theta}{2g}} = \frac{v \sin^2\theta}{g} \cdot \frac{2g}{v^2 \sin^2\theta} \Delta v = \frac{2\Delta v}{v} $$  
- Second term:  
  $$ \frac{\partial H}{\partial \theta} \cdot \frac{\Delta \theta}{H} = \left( \frac{v^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta}{g} \right) \cdot \frac{\Delta \theta}{H} $$  
  Substitute $ H = \frac{v^2 \sin^2\theta}{2g} $:  
  $$ = \frac{v^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta}{g} \cdot \frac{\Delta \theta}{\frac{v^2 \sin^2\theta}{2g}} = \frac{v^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta}{g} \cdot \frac{2g}{v^2 \sin^2\theta} \Delta \theta = 2 \cot\theta  \Delta \theta $$  

**Step 3: Combine terms**  
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta H}{H} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{2\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \cot\theta  \Delta \theta \right)^2 = 4 \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + 4 (\cot\theta)^2 (\Delta \theta)^2 $$  
Take the square root:  
$$ \frac{\Delta H}{H} = \sqrt{ 4 \left[ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + (\cot\theta)^2 (\Delta \theta)^2 \right] } = 2 \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + (\cot\theta  \Delta \theta)^2 } $$  
Thus, the relative uncertainty is:  
$$ \frac{\Delta H}{H} = 2 \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \cot\theta  \Delta \theta \right)^2 } $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{2 \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \cot\theta  \Delta \theta \right)^2 }}$$

Understanding how uncertainties combine is essential for reliable data analysis in scientific experiments.

- Validation of energy conservation in physics labs (e.g., spring-launched projectiles).  
- Sensitivity analysis in computational models for material science.  

##### Problem Statement  
A spring’s potential energy is modeled as $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$. The spring constant $k$ is measured with an absolute uncertainty $\Delta k$, and the displacement $x$ is measured with an absolute uncertainty $\Delta x$. Assume the uncertainties in $k$ and $x$ are independent and random. Derive an expression for the **relative uncertainty** $\frac{\Delta U}{U}$ in terms of $k$, $x$, $\Delta k$, and $\Delta x$.  
**Express the final answer as a single simplified analytic expression.**

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta U}{U}$, start with the formula for the potential energy:  

$$ U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2. $$
  
Since $U$ depends on $k$ and $x$, the absolute uncertainty $\Delta U$ is given by the error propagation formula for independent variables:  

$$ (\Delta U)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial k} \Delta k \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} \Delta x \right)^2. $$
  

Compute the partial derivatives:  

$$ \frac{\partial U}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial}{\partial k} \left( \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} x^2, $$
  

$$ \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \right) = k x. $$
  

Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:  

$$ (\Delta U)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} x^2 \cdot \Delta k \right)^2 + \left( k x \cdot \Delta x \right)^2. $$
  
Simplify each term:  

$$ (\Delta U)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{4} x^4 (\Delta k)^2 \right) + \left( k^2 x^2 (\Delta x)^2 \right). $$
  

The relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta U}{U}$ is related to $\Delta U$ by:  

$$ \left( \frac{\Delta U}{U} \right)^2 = \frac{(\Delta U)^2}{U^2}. $$
  
Substitute $U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$ and the expression for $(\Delta U)^2$:  

$$ \left( \frac{\Delta U}{U} \right)^2 = \frac{ \frac{1}{4} x^4 (\Delta k)^2 + k^2 x^2 (\Delta x)^2 }{ \left( \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \right)^2 } = \frac{ \frac{1}{4} x^4 (\Delta k)^2 + k^2 x^2 (\Delta x)^2 }{ \frac{1}{4} k^2 x^4 }. $$
  

Simplify the fraction by multiplying numerator and denominator by 4:  

$$ \left( \frac{\Delta U}{U} \right)^2 = \frac{ x^4 (\Delta k)^2 + 4 k^2 x^2 (\Delta x)^2 }{ k^2 x^4 }. $$
  
Factor $x^2$ in the numerator:  

$$ \left( \frac{\Delta U}{U} \right)^2 = \frac{ x^2 \left[ x^2 (\Delta k)^2 + 4 k^2 (\Delta x)^2 \right] }{ k^2 x^4 } = \frac{ x^2 (\Delta k)^2 + 4 k^2 (\Delta x)^2 }{ k^2 x^2 }. $$
  

Separate into two terms:  

$$ \left( \frac{\Delta U}{U} \right)^2 = \frac{ x^2 (\Delta k)^2 }{ k^2 x^2 } + \frac{ 4 k^2 (\Delta x)^2 }{ k^2 x^2 } = \left( \frac{\Delta k}{k} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta x}{x} \right)^2. $$
  

Take the square root to find the relative uncertainty:  

$$ \frac{\Delta U}{U} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta k}{k} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta x}{x} \right)^2 }. $$
  
This is the simplified analytic expression for the relative uncertainty in $U$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta k}{k} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta x}{x} \right)^2 }}$$

### Problem 42
##### Background  
In physics experiments, understanding the uncertainty in measurements is crucial for accurate results. Consider a scenario where you are investigating the frictional force between two surfaces. The frictional force $f$ is modeled as the product of the coefficient of friction $\mu$ and the normal force $N$. Both $\mu$ and $N$ are measured with associated uncertainties: $\mu \pm \Delta \mu$ and $N \pm \Delta N$. These uncertainties arise from limitations in measurement tools or experimental conditions.  

##### Knowledge Points Tested  
- Propagation of absolute uncertainty for a product of two independent variables.  
- Application of partial derivatives in uncertainty analysis.  
- Construction of error propagation formulas from first principles.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections  
- Connects to Newtonian mechanics (friction models).  
- Extends to statistical analysis of experimental data in laboratory physics.  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections  
- **Engineering**: Tolerance analysis in mechanical design (e.g., brake systems).  
- **Chemistry**: Uncertainty in reaction rate calculations involving concentration products.  
- **Meteorology**: Error propagation in pressure-temperature models for weather forecasting.  

##### Real-World Applications  
- **Automotive Safety**: Calculating uncertainty in braking force ensures reliable anti-lock braking systems (ABS).  
- **Manufacturing**: Quality control for surface treatments where friction coefficients affect product durability.  
- **Sports Science**: Optimizing shoe-traction designs for athletes by quantifying force-measurement errors.  

##### Problem Statement  
The frictional force $f$ is given by $f = \mu N$, where $\mu$ and $N$ are measured with independent absolute uncertainties $\Delta \mu$ and $\Delta N$, respectively. Derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta f$ in terms of $\mu$, $N$, $\Delta \mu$, and $\Delta N$. Assume all uncertainties are uncorrelated and random.  

**Format Requirements**:  
- Express $\Delta f$ as a single analytic expression using the variables $\mu$, $N$, $\Delta \mu$, and $\Delta N$.  
- Use explicit notation for all operations (e.g., $\sqrt{\ }$ for square roots, $^2$ for squares).  
- Do not simplify or evaluate numerically; retain the exact symbolic form.

### Solution
To find the absolute uncertainty $\Delta f$ in the frictional force $f = \mu N$, we use the general formula for error propagation in a product of independent variables. The absolute uncertainty $\Delta f$ is given by the root sum of squares of the partial derivatives scaled by their respective uncertainties:  

$$ \Delta f = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} \Delta \mu \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial N} \Delta N \right)^2 } $$  

First, compute the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $\mu$:  
$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} (\mu N) = N \quad \text{(since $N$ is constant with respect to $\mu$)} $$  

Next, compute the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $N$:  
$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial N} = \frac{\partial}{\partial N} (\mu N) = \mu \quad \text{(since $\mu$ is constant with respect to $N$)} $$  

Substitute these derivatives into the uncertainty formula:  
$$ \Delta f = \sqrt{ \left( N \cdot \Delta \mu \right)^2 + \left( \mu \cdot \Delta N \right)^2 } $$  

This simplifies to:  
$$ \Delta f = \sqrt{ (N \Delta \mu)^2 + (\mu \Delta N)^2 } $$  

The expression is now fully derived. No further simplification is required, as it is an exact analytic form.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{(N \Delta \mu)^2 + (\mu \Delta N)^2}}$$

### Problem 43
##### Background
In projectile motion, the time of flight $T$ represents the duration a projectile remains airborne when launched with initial speed $v$ at angle $\theta$ relative to the horizontal. The formula $T = \frac{2v \sin\theta}{g}$ depends on $v$ and $\theta$, where $g$ is the constant acceleration due to gravity. Experimental measurements of $v$ and $\theta$ inherently carry uncertainties $\Delta v$ and $\Delta \theta$ (in radians), respectively. Understanding how these uncertainties propagate to $T$ is essential for predicting the reliability of calculated results in fields like ballistics, sports science, and engineering.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- Sports analytics (e.g., uncertainty in hang time of a football or golf ball)
- Quality control in manufacturing (e.g., consistency of projected particle durations)

##### Problem Statement
The time of flight for a projectile is given by $T = \frac{2v \sin\theta}{g}$, where $g$ is constant and known exactly. The initial speed $v$ has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$, and the launch angle $\theta$ (measured in radians) has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta \theta$. Both uncertainties are independent. Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty in $T$, denoted $\frac{\Delta T}{T}$. Express your final answer symbolically in terms of $v$, $\theta$, $\Delta v$, and $\Delta \theta$, using the notation $\cot \theta$ for the cotangent function. Ensure all partial derivatives are explicitly shown in your derivation.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta T}{T}$, we use the propagation of uncertainty formula for independent variables:
$$
(\Delta T)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial v} \Delta v \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial \theta} \Delta \theta \right)^2
$$
First, compute the partial derivatives of $T = \frac{2v \sin\theta}{g}$ with respect to $v$ and $\theta$:
$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial v} = \frac{2 \sin\theta}{g}, \quad \frac{\partial T}{\partial \theta} = \frac{2v \cos\theta}{g}
$$
Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:
$$
(\Delta T)^2 = \left( \frac{2 \sin\theta}{g} \Delta v \right)^2 + \left( \frac{2v \cos\theta}{g} \Delta \theta \right)^2 = \frac{4}{g^2} \left[ (\sin\theta \cdot \Delta v)^2 + (v \cos\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2 \right]
$$
The relative uncertainty is $\frac{\Delta T}{T}$. Since $T = \frac{2v \sin\theta}{g}$:
$$
\frac{\Delta T}{T} = \frac{ \sqrt{ \frac{4}{g^2} \left[ (\sin\theta \cdot \Delta v)^2 + (v \cos\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2 \right] } }{ \frac{2v \sin\theta}{g} } = \frac{ \frac{2}{g} \sqrt{ (\sin\theta \cdot \Delta v)^2 + (v \cos\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2 } }{ \frac{2v \sin\theta}{g} }
$$
Simplify by canceling common factors:
$$
\frac{\Delta T}{T} = \frac{ \sqrt{ (\sin\theta \cdot \Delta v)^2 + (v \cos\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2 } }{ v \sin\theta } = \sqrt{ \frac{ (\sin\theta \cdot \Delta v)^2 }{ (v \sin\theta)^2 } + \frac{ (v \cos\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2 }{ (v \sin\theta)^2 } }
$$
Simplify each term under the square root:
$$
\frac{ (\sin\theta \cdot \Delta v)^2 }{ (v \sin\theta)^2 } = \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2, \quad \frac{ (v \cos\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2 }{ (v \sin\theta)^2 } = \left( \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \cdot \Delta \theta \right)^2 = (\cot\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2
$$
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
$$
\frac{\Delta T}{T} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \cot\theta \cdot \Delta \theta \right)^2 }
$$

### Answer

### Problem 44
##### Background
In electrical engineering and experimental physics, measuring power consumption is fundamental. Power $P$ in a resistive circuit is calculated as the product of current $I$ and voltage $V$, expressed as $P = IV$. All physical measurements involve uncertainty: current is measured as $I \pm \Delta I$, and voltage as $V \pm \Delta V$, where $\Delta I$ and $\Delta V$ represent absolute uncertainties. To assess the reliability of power calculations, we analyze how uncertainties propagate through multiplicative relationships.

2. **Partial derivatives**: Using calculus to quantify sensitivity to individual variables.
3. **Root-sum-square (RSS) combination**: Combining independent uncertainties geometrically under the assumption of statistical independence.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Problem Statement
An experiment measures current $I$ with absolute uncertainty $\Delta I$ and voltage $V$ with absolute uncertainty $\Delta V$. The power dissipated is calculated as $P = IV$. Assuming $I$ and $V$ are statistically independent measured quantities:  
**Derive an analytic expression for the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$ in terms of $I$, $\Delta I$, $V$, and $\Delta V$.**  
*Express your final answer as a single simplified expression enclosed in \boxed{}.*

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$, we use error propagation for the function $P(I, V) = IV$. For a multivariate function, the uncertainty $\Delta P$ is given by:
$$
(\Delta P)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial I} \Delta I \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} \Delta V \right)^2
$$
since $I$ and $V$ are independent.  

**Step 1: Compute partial derivatives**  
- Partial derivative with respect to $I$:  
  $$
  \frac{\partial P}{\partial I} = \frac{\partial}{\partial I}(IV) = V
  $$
- Partial derivative with respect to $V$:  
  $$
  \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial}{\partial V}(IV) = I
  $$

**Step 2: Substitute into uncertainty formula**  
$$
(\Delta P)^2 = (V \cdot \Delta I)^2 + (I \cdot \Delta V)^2
$$

**Step 3: Express relative uncertainty**  
Relative uncertainty is $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$. Since $P = IV$, we write:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta P}{P} \right)^2 = \frac{(\Delta P)^2}{P^2} = \frac{(V \Delta I)^2 + (I \Delta V)^2}{(IV)^2}
$$

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
$$
\begin{align*}
\left( \frac{\Delta P}{P} \right)^2 &= \frac{V^2 (\Delta I)^2 + I^2 (\Delta V)^2}{I^2 V^2} \\
&= \frac{(\Delta I)^2}{I^2} + \frac{(\Delta V)^2}{V^2}
\end{align*}
$$

**Step 5: Take square root for final form**  
$$
\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta I}{I} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 }
$$
This is the relative uncertainty in power as a function of the relative uncertainties in current and voltage.

### Answer
$$
\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta I}{I} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 }}
$$

### Problem 45
##### Background
In physics experiments, precise measurements of forces are crucial. The magnetic force on a moving charged particle is given by the formula $F = qvB\sin\theta$, where $q$ is the charge, $v$ is the velocity, $B$ is the magnetic field strength, and $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector. Each measured quantity has an associated uncertainty: $q \pm \Delta q$, $v \pm \Delta v$, $B \pm \Delta B$, and $\theta \pm \Delta \theta$. These uncertainties propagate to the calculated force $F$.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Understanding the formula for magnetic force.
2. Applying partial derivatives to compute sensitivity coefficients for uncertainty propagation.
3. Using the root-sum-square method for combining independent uncertainties.
4. Handling angular uncertainties in trigonometric functions (requires $\Delta \theta$ in radians).

- Extends to uncertainty principles in quantum mechanics (conceptual link).

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Statistics:** Propagation of variance in multivariate functions.
- **Meteorology:** Uncertainty in vector-based force calculations (e.g., wind and pressure systems).

##### Real-World Applications
- Calibrating mass spectrometers to identify chemical compounds.
- Designing magnetic confinement systems in fusion reactors.
- Validating particle trajectories in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

##### Problem Statement
A charged particle moves through a magnetic field. The measured parameters and their uncertainties are:  
- Charge: $q \pm \Delta q$  
- Speed: $v \pm \Delta v$  
- Magnetic field strength: $B \pm \Delta B$  
- Angle between vectors: $\theta \pm \Delta \theta$ (with $\Delta \theta$ in radians).  

Using the formula $F = qvB\sin\theta$, derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta F$ in the magnetic force. Assume all uncertainties are independent and random. Express $\Delta F$ symbolically in terms of $q$, $\Delta q$, $v$, $\Delta v$, $B$, $\Delta B$, $\theta$, and $\Delta \theta$.

### Solution
The absolute uncertainty $\Delta F$ is found using the root-sum-square formula for independent variables:
$$
\Delta F = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} \Delta q \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial v} \Delta v \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial B} \Delta B \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta} \Delta \theta \right)^2 }.
$$

First, compute the partial derivatives of $F = qvB\sin\theta$:
- $\frac{\partial F}{\partial q} = vB\sin\theta$
- $\frac{\partial F}{\partial v} = qB\sin\theta$
- $\frac{\partial F}{\partial B} = qv\sin\theta$
- $\frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta} = qvB\cos\theta$

Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:
$$
\Delta F = \sqrt{ 
  (vB\sin\theta \cdot \Delta q)^2 + 
  (qB\sin\theta \cdot \Delta v)^2 + 
  (qv\sin\theta \cdot \Delta B)^2 + 
  (qvB\cos\theta \cdot \Delta \theta)^2 
}.
$$

Factor out common terms:
$$
\Delta F = \sqrt{ 
  (vB\sin\theta)^2 (\Delta q)^2 + 
  (qB\sin\theta)^2 (\Delta v)^2 + 
  (qv\sin\theta)^2 (\Delta B)^2 + 
  (qvB\cos\theta)^2 (\Delta \theta)^2 
}.
$$

This is the final expression for the absolute uncertainty in $F$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{(vB\sin\theta \Delta q)^{2} + (qB\sin\theta \Delta v)^{2} + (qv\sin\theta \Delta B)^{2} + (qvB\cos\theta \Delta \theta)^{2}}}$$

### Problem 46
##### Background
In fluid mechanics, hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by a fluid at equilibrium due to the force of gravity. This pressure is calculated using the formula $P = \rho g h$, where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height of the fluid column. Experimental measurements of $\rho$, $g$, and $h$ always involve uncertainties, denoted as $\Delta \rho$, $\Delta g$, and $\Delta h$ respectively. These uncertainties propagate to the calculated pressure $P$. Understanding how to quantify this propagation is essential for accurate scientific reporting and engineering design.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

2. Partial differentiation for multi-variable functions.
3. Relative uncertainty calculation.
4. Root-sum-square (RSS) combination of independent errors.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- **Environmental Science**: Error estimation in atmospheric/oceanic pressure models.
- **Metrology**: Standard protocols for reporting measurement precision in calibration labs.

##### Real-World Applications

- Calibrating medical infusion pumps where fluid density ($\rho$) variations impact dosage accuracy.
- Geophysical surveys where gravity ($g$) measurements influence oil reservoir pressure estimates.

##### Problem Statement
A student measures the density $\rho$, gravitational acceleration $g$, and fluid height $h$ with respective uncertainties $\Delta \rho$, $\Delta g$, and $\Delta h$. The variables $\rho$, $g$, and $h$ are statistically independent. Starting from the general formula for uncertainty propagation in a function $f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$:  
$$  
\Delta f = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \Delta x_i \right)^2 },  
$$  
derive an expression for the **relative uncertainty** $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$ in the hydrostatic pressure $P = \rho g h$. Express your result symbolically in terms of the relative uncertainties $\frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho}$, $\frac{\Delta g}{g}$, and $\frac{\Delta h}{h}$. Show all steps explicitly.

### Solution
The hydrostatic pressure is given by:  
$$ P = \rho g h. $$  
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$, first compute the absolute uncertainty $\Delta P$ using the general propagation formula for independent variables:  
$$  
\Delta P = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho} \Delta \rho \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial g} \Delta g \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial h} \Delta h \right)^2 }.  
$$  

Calculate each partial derivative:  
- $\frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho} = g h$ (since $g$ and $h$ are treated as constants),  
- $\frac{\partial P}{\partial g} = \rho h$ (since $\rho$ and $h$ are constants),  
- $\frac{\partial P}{\partial h} = \rho g$ (since $\rho$ and $g$ are constants).  

Substitute these into the $\Delta P$ equation:  
$$  
\Delta P = \sqrt{ (g h \cdot \Delta \rho)^2 + (\rho h \cdot \Delta g)^2 + (\rho g \cdot \Delta h)^2 }.  
$$  

The relative uncertainty is $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$. Since $P = \rho g h$,  
$$  
\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{ \sqrt{ (g h \Delta \rho)^2 + (\rho h \Delta g)^2 + (\rho g \Delta h)^2 } }{ \rho g h }.  
$$  

Simplify the expression under the square root:  
$$  
\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \sqrt{ \frac{ (g h \Delta \rho)^2 }{ (\rho g h)^2 } + \frac{ (\rho h \Delta g)^2 }{ (\rho g h)^2 } + \frac{ (\rho g \Delta h)^2 }{ (\rho g h)^2 } }.  
$$  

Reduce each fraction:  
- $\frac{ (g h \Delta \rho)^2 }{ (\rho g h)^2 } = \left( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right)^2$,  
- $\frac{ (\rho h \Delta g)^2 }{ (\rho g h)^2 } = \left( \frac{\Delta g}{g} \right)^2$,  
- $\frac{ (\rho g \Delta h)^2 }{ (\rho g h)^2 } = \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2$.  

Thus,  
$$  
\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta g}{g} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 }.  
$$  
This is the relative uncertainty in $P$.

### Answer
$$ \boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta g}{g} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 } } $$

In experimental physics, understanding the propagation of uncertainty is crucial when measuring derived quantities. Consider the Coulomb potential energy between two point charges, a fundamental concept in electrostatics. The potential energy $U$ is given by:
$$ U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} $$
where $k$ is a constant, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the charges, and $r$ is the distance between them. In a laboratory setting, measurements of $q_1$, $q_2$, and $r$ have associated uncertainties $\Delta q_1$, $\Delta q_2$, and $\Delta r$, respectively. These uncertainties arise from limitations in measurement instruments or environmental factors.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

##### Problem Statement
Two point charges with magnitudes $q_1 \pm \Delta q_1$ and $q_2 \pm \Delta q_2$ are separated by a distance $r \pm \Delta r$. The Coulomb potential energy $U$ is given by $U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}$, where $k$ is an exact constant. Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta U}{U}$ in terms of the relative uncertainties $\frac{\Delta q_1}{q_1}$, $\frac{\Delta q_2}{q_2}$, and $\frac{\Delta r}{r}$. Assume all uncertainties are independent and random. Express your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta U}{U}$, we use the general formula for error propagation in a function of multiple variables. For $U = k q_1 q_2 r^{-1}$, the relative uncertainty squared is:
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta U}{U} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_1} \frac{\Delta q_1}{U} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_2} \frac{\Delta q_2}{U} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial r} \frac{\Delta r}{U} \right)^2 $$

First, compute the partial derivatives:
1. $\frac{\partial U}{\partial q_1} = k \frac{q_2}{r}$  
2. $\frac{\partial U}{\partial q_2} = k \frac{q_1}{r}$  
3. $\frac{\partial U}{\partial r} = -k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$  

Substitute these into the error propagation formula:
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta U}{U} \right)^2 = \left( \left(k \frac{q_2}{r}\right) \frac{\Delta q_1}{k q_1 q_2 / r} \right)^2 + \left( \left(k \frac{q_1}{r}\right) \frac{\Delta q_2}{k q_1 q_2 / r} \right)^2 + \left( \left(-k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\right) \frac{\Delta r}{k q_1 q_2 / r} \right)^2 $$

Simplify each term:
1. $\left( \frac{k q_2 / r}{k q_1 q_2 / r} \Delta q_1 \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta q_1}{q_1} \right)^2$  
2. $\left( \frac{k q_1 / r}{k q_1 q_2 / r} \Delta q_2 \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta q_2}{q_2} \right)^2$  
3. $\left( \frac{-k q_1 q_2 / r^2}{k q_1 q_2 / r} \Delta r \right)^2 = \left( -\frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2$  

Combine the simplified terms:
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta U}{U} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta q_1}{q_1} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta q_2}{q_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 $$

Take the square root to obtain the relative uncertainty:
$$ \frac{\Delta U}{U} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta q_1}{q_1} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta q_2}{q_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 } $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta q_{1}}{q_{1}} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta q_{2}}{q_{2}} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^{2} }}$$

### Problem 48
##### Background
In materials science, Young's modulus (Y) quantifies a material's stiffness and is determined experimentally by applying tensile stress to a specimen. The formula for Young's modulus is derived from Hooke's law:  
$$ Y = \frac{F L_0}{A \Delta L} $$  
where:  
- $F$ is the applied force,  
- $L_0$ is the original length of the specimen,  
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and  
- $\Delta L$ is the change in length under load.  

Experimental measurements always involve uncertainty. The force is measured as $F \pm \Delta F$, the original length as $L_0 \pm \Delta L_0$, the cross-sectional area as $A \pm \Delta A$, and the elongation as $\Delta L \pm \Delta(\Delta L)$.

- Biomedical engineering (e.g., measuring elasticity of artificial tendons).  
- Aerospace testing (e.g., validating material properties for aircraft components).  

##### Problem Statement  
Using the formula for Young's modulus $Y = \frac{F L_0}{A \Delta L}$, derive an expression for the **relative uncertainty** $\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}$ in terms of the relative uncertainties of the measured quantities:  
- Force: $\frac{\Delta F}{F}$  
- Original length: $\frac{\Delta L_0}{L_0}$  
- Cross-sectional area: $\frac{\Delta A}{A}$  
- Change in length: $\frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\Delta L}$  

Express your final answer as a single analytic expression under a square root symbol, using only the symbols for the relative uncertainties listed above.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}$, we use the error propagation formula for a function of multiple variables. For $Y = \frac{F L_0}{A \Delta L}$, the relative uncertainty is given by:  
$$ \frac{\Delta Y}{Y} = \sqrt{ \sum \left( \frac{\partial Y}{\partial x_i} \cdot \frac{\Delta x_i}{Y} \right)^2 } $$  
where $x_i$ represents each variable ($F$, $L_0$, $A$, $\Delta L$).  

First, compute the partial derivatives of $Y$ with respect to each variable:  
1. For $F$:  
   $$ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial F} = \frac{L_0}{A \Delta L} $$  
   Thus,  
   $$ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial F} \cdot \frac{\Delta F}{Y} = \left( \frac{L_0}{A \Delta L} \right) \cdot \frac{\Delta F}{\frac{F L_0}{A \Delta L}} = \frac{\Delta F}{F} $$  

2. For $L_0$:  
   $$ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial L_0} = \frac{F}{A \Delta L} $$  
   Thus,  
   $$ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial L_0} \cdot \frac{\Delta L_0}{Y} = \left( \frac{F}{A \Delta L} \right) \cdot \frac{\Delta L_0}{\frac{F L_0}{A \Delta L}} = \frac{\Delta L_0}{L_0} $$  

3. For $A$:  
   $$ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial A} = -\frac{F L_0}{A^2 \Delta L} $$  
   Thus,  
   $$ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial A} \cdot \frac{\Delta A}{Y} = \left( -\frac{F L_0}{A^2 \Delta L} \right) \cdot \frac{\Delta A}{\frac{F L_0}{A \Delta L}} = -\frac{\Delta A}{A} $$  
   The square eliminates the sign: $\left( -\frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^2$.  

4. For $\Delta L$:  
   $$ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial (\Delta L)} = -\frac{F L_0}{A (\Delta L)^2} $$  
   Thus,  
   $$ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial (\Delta L)} \cdot \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{Y} = \left( -\frac{F L_0}{A (\Delta L)^2} \right) \cdot \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\frac{F L_0}{A \Delta L}} = -\frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\Delta L} $$  
   Similarly, $\left( -\frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\Delta L} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\Delta L} \right)^2$.  

Combining these contributions, the relative uncertainty in $Y$ is:  
$$ \frac{\Delta Y}{Y} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta L_0}{L_0} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\Delta L} \right)^2 } $$  
This is the final expression for the relative uncertainty.

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta L_{0}}{L_{0}} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta A}{A} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta L)}{\Delta L} \right)^{2} } }$$

### Problem 49
##### Background
In quantum physics, the energy of a single photon is given by the equation $E = hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave. This relationship underpins technologies like solar cells, optical communications, and medical imaging. When measuring frequency experimentally (e.g., using interferometry or diffraction gratings), all instruments have inherent precision limits, leading to an absolute uncertainty $\Delta f$ in the frequency measurement. Since Planck's constant $h$ is a defined physical constant with negligible uncertainty, the dominant source of error in calculating photon energy comes from the frequency measurement.

- Assessing uncertainty in photovoltaic efficiency calculations for solar panels

##### Problem Statement
A laboratory measures the frequency of monochromatic light as $f \pm \Delta f$ using a high-resolution spectrometer. Planck's constant $h$ is treated as an exact value with no uncertainty. Derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta E$ in the photon energy $E = hf$ solely in terms of $h$ and $\Delta f$. Express your final answer as a simplified analytic expression.  
*Format requirements*:  
- Use only the variables $h$ and $\Delta f$  
- Do **not** include $E$ or $f$ in the final expression  
- Express multiplication explicitly (e.g., $h \cdot \Delta f$, not $h\Delta f$)

### Solution
To derive the absolute uncertainty $\Delta E$ in the energy $E = hf$, where $h$ is a constant and $f$ has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta f$, apply the derivative-based uncertainty propagation formula for a function of one variable. The general formula for absolute uncertainty in a function $g(x)$ is:
$$
\Delta g \approx \left| \frac{dg}{dx} \right| \Delta x
$$
Here, $E$ is a function of $f$: $E(f) = h \cdot f$, with $h$ constant.  

**Step 1**: Compute the derivative of $E$ with respect to $f$:  
$$
\frac{dE}{df} = \frac{d}{df}(h \cdot f) = h
$$
Since $h$ is a positive constant, the absolute value is $|h| = h$.  

**Step 2**: Apply the uncertainty propagation formula:  
$$
\Delta E = \left| \frac{dE}{df} \right| \Delta f = h \cdot \Delta f
$$
This result shows that the absolute uncertainty in energy is directly proportional to both Planck's constant and the absolute uncertainty in frequency.  

**Step 3**: Verify dimensionality. Energy has units of joules (J), $h$ has units of joule-seconds (J·s), and $\Delta f$ has units of hertz (s⁻¹). Thus:  
$$
[h \cdot \Delta f] = \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \cdot \text{s}^{-1} = \text{J}
$$
which matches the units of $\Delta E$, confirming dimensional consistency.  

The absolute uncertainty in photon energy is therefore $h \cdot \Delta f$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{h \cdot \Delta f}$$

### Problem 5
##### Background
In an electronics laboratory, students are measuring the resistance of a circuit component using Ohm's law. They use a voltmeter to measure the voltage drop $V$ across the component and an ammeter to measure the current $I$ flowing through it. Each instrument has a specified absolute uncertainty: $\Delta V$ for the voltmeter and $\Delta I$ for the ammeter. The resistance $R$ is calculated as $R = V/I$. To assess the reliability of their result, students must quantify how uncertainties in $V$ and $I$ propagate to the absolute uncertainty in $R$.

##### Problem Statement
The resistance $R$ of a component is calculated from voltage and current measurements: $R = V/I$. The voltage $V$ has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta V$, and the current $I$ has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta I$. Assume $\Delta V$ and $\Delta I$ arise from independent random errors.  

Using calculus-based error propagation, derive an analytic expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta R$ in the resistance $R$. Express $\Delta R$ symbolically in terms of $V$, $I$, $\Delta V$, and $\Delta I$.  

**Answer Format Requirements**:  
- Provide your final answer as a single analytic expression.  
- Use $\Delta V$, $\Delta I$, $V$, and $I$ explicitly in the expression.  
- Square roots must be expressed using $\sqrt{}$.  
- Fractions must be written with the numerator and denominator enclosed in curly braces (e.g., $\frac{\Delta V}{V}$).  
- Do **not** substitute numerical values or simplify by canceling terms unless mathematically necessary.

### Solution
To find the absolute uncertainty $\Delta R$ in $R = V/I$, we use the root-sum-square formula for error propagation in a function of multiple variables. For $R(V, I)$, the absolute uncertainty is:

$$
\Delta R = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial V} \Delta V \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial I} \Delta I \right)^2 }
$$

First, compute the partial derivatives of $R$ with respect to $V$ and $I$:

$$
\frac{\partial R}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial}{\partial V} \left( \frac{V}{I} \right) = \frac{1}{I}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial R}{\partial I} = \frac{\partial}{\partial I} \left( \frac{V}{I} \right) = -\frac{V}{I^2}
$$

Substitute these derivatives into the error propagation formula:

$$
\Delta R = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{1}{I} \cdot \Delta V \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{V}{I^2} \cdot \Delta I \right)^2 }
$$

Simplify the squared terms:

$$
\Delta R = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta V}{I} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{V \Delta I}{I^2} \right)^2 }
$$

Factor out $1/I^2$ from both terms inside the square root:

$$
\Delta R = \sqrt{ \frac{(\Delta V)^2}{I^2} + \frac{V^2 (\Delta I)^2}{I^4} } = \sqrt{ \frac{ I^2 (\Delta V)^2 + V^2 (\Delta I)^2 }{I^4} }
$$

Simplify the expression under the square root:

$$
\Delta R = \frac{ \sqrt{ I^2 (\Delta V)^2 + V^2 (\Delta I)^2 } }{I^2}
$$

This is the analytic expression for $\Delta R$ in terms of $V$, $I$, $\Delta V$, and $\Delta I$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \dfrac{ \sqrt{ I^{2} \left( \Delta V \right)^{2} + V^{2} \left( \Delta I \right)^{2} } }{ I^{2} } }$$

### Problem 50
##### Background  
In experimental physics and engineering, precise measurements are crucial. When multiple independent measurements of the same quantity are taken, the mean value is often reported to improve accuracy. However, each measurement carries an uncertainty, and these uncertainties propagate when calculating the mean. Consider a scenario where two researchers independently measure the length of a titanium alloy rod using calibrated instruments. The first researcher reports $L_1 \pm \Delta L_1$, and the second reports $L_2 \pm \Delta L_2$, where $\Delta L_1$ and $\Delta L_2$ are the absolute uncertainties in each measurement. The mean length is defined as $\bar{L} = (L_1 + L_2)/2$.  

##### Knowledge Points Tested  
- Propagation of uncertainty for independent measurements.  
- Derivation of absolute uncertainty in a linear combination of variables.  
- Application of partial derivatives in error analysis.  

##### Intradisciplinary Connections  
This problem connects to statistical analysis of data (e.g., standard error of the mean) and reinforces foundational calculus concepts like partial differentiation. It also extends to curve-fitting methods where weighted averages depend on measurement uncertainties.  

##### Interdisciplinary Connections  
- **Statistics**: Uncertainty propagation relies on variance rules for independent random variables.  
- **Engineering**: Precision in manufacturing tolerances requires aggregating measurements from multiple sensors.  
- **Environmental Science**: Averaging field measurements (e.g., pollutant concentrations) necessitates uncertainty quantification.  

##### Real-World Applications  
- Calibrating satellite altimeters that measure sea-level rise by combining redundant sensors.  
- Quality control in semiconductor fabrication, where wafer thickness is averaged across multiple probes to reduce error.  
- Medical imaging devices (e.g., MRI) that merge scans from different angles to enhance resolution.  

##### Problem Statement  
Derive the absolute uncertainty $\Delta \bar{L}$ in the mean length $\bar{L} = (L_1 + L_2)/2$, where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are independent measurements with absolute uncertainties $\Delta L_1$ and $\Delta L_2$, respectively. Assume the uncertainties are uncorrelated and arise from random errors. Express $\Delta \bar{L}$ as a symbolic function of $\Delta L_1$ and $\Delta L_2$ only.  

**Answer Format Instructions**  
- Provide your final answer as a single analytic expression enclosed in `\boxed{}`.  
- Use only the symbols $\Delta L_1$ and $\Delta L_2$ in your expression.  
- Simplify the expression maximally (e.g., combine constants).  
- Do not evaluate numerically or include units.

### Solution
To find the absolute uncertainty $\Delta \bar{L}$ in the mean length $\bar{L} = (L_1 + L_2)/2$, we use the general formula for propagation of uncertainty in a function of independent variables. For a function $f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$, the absolute uncertainty $\Delta f$ is given by:  
$$
\Delta f = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \Delta x_i \right)^2 },
$$
where $\Delta x_i$ is the absolute uncertainty in $x_i$, and all uncertainties are independent.  

Here, $\bar{L}$ is a function of $L_1$ and $L_2$:  
$$
\bar{L}(L_1, L_2) = \frac{L_1 + L_2}{2}.
$$

Compute the partial derivatives of $\bar{L}$ with respect to $L_1$ and $L_2$:  
$$
\frac{\partial \bar{L}}{\partial L_1} = \frac{\partial}{\partial L_1} \left( \frac{L_1 + L_2}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2},
$$
$$
\frac{\partial \bar{L}}{\partial L_2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial L_2} \left( \frac{L_1 + L_2}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Substitute these partial derivatives and the uncertainties $\Delta L_1$ and $\Delta L_2$ into the uncertainty propagation formula:  
$$
\Delta \bar{L} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial \bar{L}}{\partial L_1} \Delta L_1 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial \bar{L}}{\partial L_2} \Delta L_2 \right)^2 } = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \Delta L_1 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \Delta L_2 \right)^2 }.
$$

Simplify the expression inside the square root:  
$$
\left( \frac{1}{2} \Delta L_1 \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} (\Delta L_1)^2, \quad \left( \frac{1}{2} \Delta L_2 \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} (\Delta L_2)^2.
$$
Thus,  
$$
\Delta \bar{L} = \sqrt{ \frac{(\Delta L_1)^2}{4} + \frac{(\Delta L_2)^2}{4} } = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} \left( (\Delta L_1)^2 + (\Delta L_2)^2 \right) }.
$$

Factor out the constant $\frac{1}{4}$:  
$$
\Delta \bar{L} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} } \cdot \sqrt{ (\Delta L_1)^2 + (\Delta L_2)^2 } = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ (\Delta L_1)^2 + (\Delta L_2)^2 }.
$$

This is the absolute uncertainty in the mean length $\bar{L}$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{(\Delta L_1)^2 + (\Delta L_2)^2}}{2}}$$

### Problem 51
##### Background
In acoustics experiments, the speed of sound is often measured by timing how long it takes for a sound wave to travel a known distance. A student sets up a straight tube of length $d$ with a sound emitter at one end and a sensor at the other. The distance $d$ is measured with an uncertainty $\Delta d$ due to calibration errors in the measuring tape, and the travel time $t$ is recorded with an uncertainty $\Delta t$ caused by limitations in the electronic timing system. The speed of sound $v$ is calculated as $v = d / t$. Understanding how uncertainties in $d$ and $t$ propagate to the final result is essential for evaluating the experiment's accuracy.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
1. Propagation of uncertainty for a quotient of two measured quantities.
2. Application of partial derivatives and root-sum-square combination for independent random errors.
3. Derivation of absolute uncertainty from relative uncertainties.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This connects to measurement techniques in wave physics, error analysis in experimental design, and the study of sound waves in different media. It also reinforces concepts in calculus-based physics, such as partial differentiation.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Error propagation is fundamental in fields like engineering (e.g., tolerance analysis in manufacturing), chemistry (e.g., concentration calculations), and environmental science (e.g., seismic wave velocity measurements).

##### Real-World Applications
Accurate uncertainty analysis is critical in sonar systems for underwater navigation, medical ultrasound imaging, and acoustic positioning in robotics. Misestimating uncertainties can lead to faulty conclusions in climate science (e.g., speed of sound in oceans for temperature monitoring).

##### Problem Statement
Using the formula $v = d / t$, derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$ in the speed of sound, given that $d$ and $t$ have independent random uncertainties $\Delta d$ and $\Delta t$, respectively. Express $\Delta v$ symbolically in terms of $d$, $t$, $\Delta d$, and $\Delta t$ only. Simplify the expression as much as possible. Ensure all derivatives are explicitly calculated and combined using root-sum-square.

### Solution
The absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$ is derived using error propagation for independent variables. For $v(d, t) = d / t$, the general formula for the absolute uncertainty is:

$$
(\Delta v)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial d} \right)^2 (\Delta d)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} \right)^2 (\Delta t)^2
$$

First, compute the partial derivatives:

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial d} = \frac{\partial}{\partial d} \left( \frac{d}{t} \right) = \frac{1}{t}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{d}{t} \right) = -\frac{d}{t^2}
$$

Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:

$$
(\Delta v)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{t} \right)^2 (\Delta d)^2 + \left( -\frac{d}{t^2} \right)^2 (\Delta t)^2 = \frac{(\Delta d)^2}{t^2} + \frac{d^2 (\Delta t)^2}{t^4}
$$

Factor out $1/t^2$:

$$
(\Delta v)^2 = \frac{1}{t^2} \left( (\Delta d)^2 + \frac{d^2 (\Delta t)^2}{t^2} \right)
$$

Rewrite the expression under the square root as a single fraction:

$$
(\Delta v)^2 = \frac{(\Delta d)^2}{t^2} + \frac{d^2 (\Delta t)^2}{t^4} = \frac{t^2 (\Delta d)^2 + d^2 (\Delta t)^2}{t^4}
$$

Take the square root to solve for $\Delta v$:

$$
\Delta v = \frac{ \sqrt{ t^2 (\Delta d)^2 + d^2 (\Delta t)^2 } }{t^2}
$$

Simplify by factoring $t^2$ in the numerator:

$$
\Delta v = \frac{ \sqrt{ t^2 \left( (\Delta d)^2 + \frac{d^2 (\Delta t)^2}{t^2} \right) } }{t^2} = \frac{ |t| \sqrt{ (\Delta d)^2 + \left( \frac{d \Delta t}{t} \right)^2 } }{t^2}
$$

Since $t > 0$ (time is positive), $|t| = t$:

$$
\Delta v = \frac{t \sqrt{ (\Delta d)^2 + \left( \frac{d \Delta t}{t} \right)^2 } }{t^2} = \frac{ \sqrt{ (\Delta d)^2 + \frac{d^2 (\Delta t)^2}{t^2} } }{t}
$$

This simplifies to the standard form:

$$
\Delta v = \frac{d}{t} \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta d}{d} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta t}{t} \right)^2 }
$$

Thus, the absolute uncertainty in $v$ is:

$$
\Delta v = \frac{d}{t} \sqrt{ \frac{(\Delta d)^2}{d^2} + \frac{(\Delta t)^2}{t^2} }
$$

### Answer
$$
\boxed{\dfrac{d}{t} \sqrt{ \dfrac{(\Delta d)^{2}}{d^{2}} + \dfrac{(\Delta t)^{2}}{t^{2}} }}
$$

### Problem 52
##### Background
In experimental physics, the ideal gas law is a fundamental equation of state for a hypothetical ideal gas: $P = \frac{nRT}{V}$, where $P$ is pressure, $n$ is the number of moles (constant), $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is temperature, and $V$ is volume. When measuring temperature and volume experimentally, uncertainties arise due to instrument limitations. Suppose a gas sample's temperature $T$ has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta T$, and its volume $V$ has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta V$. 

##### Knowledge Points Tested

- Partial derivatives in uncertainty analysis
- Relative uncertainty calculations
- Ideal gas law relationships

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
Connects to thermodynamics (ideal gas behavior), calculus (partial differentiation), and experimental physics (error quantification). Extends to more complex equations of state like Van der Waals equations.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Relevant to chemistry (gas reactions), engineering (pressure vessel design), and environmental science (atmospheric modeling). Error propagation principles apply broadly to any field involving measured quantities.

##### Real-World Applications
- Calibrating pressure sensors in industrial systems
- Validating climate models where temperature and volume uncertainties affect pressure predictions
- Quality control in pharmaceutical manufacturing where gas pressures must be precisely monitored

##### Problem Statement
A laboratory measures the temperature $T$ and volume $V$ of an ideal gas sample, with $n$ and $R$ known exactly. The temperature measurement has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta T$, and the volume measurement has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta V$. Using the ideal gas law $P = \frac{nRT}{V}$, derive an expression for the **relative uncertainty** $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$ in terms of $\frac{\Delta T}{T}$, $\frac{\Delta V}{V}$, and fundamental constants. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression using the symbols $\Delta T$, $T$, $\Delta V$, and $V$ only.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$, start with the ideal gas law:  
$$ P = \frac{nRT}{V} $$  

Since $P$ depends on $T$ and $V$, the uncertainty $\Delta P$ is derived using partial derivatives. The general formula for uncertainty propagation when $P = f(T, V)$ is:  
$$ (\Delta P)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial T} \Delta T \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} \Delta V \right)^2 $$  

First, compute the partial derivatives. For $\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}$:  
$$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial T} = \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \left( \frac{nRT}{V} \right) = \frac{nR}{V} $$  

For $\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}$:  
$$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial}{\partial V} \left( \frac{nRT}{V} \right) = -\frac{nRT}{V^2} $$  

Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:  
$$ (\Delta P)^2 = \left( \frac{nR}{V} \Delta T \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{nRT}{V^2} \Delta V \right)^2 $$  
$$ (\Delta P)^2 = \left( \frac{nR \Delta T}{V} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{nRT \Delta V}{V^2} \right)^2 $$  
$$ (\Delta P)^2 = \frac{(nR)^2 (\Delta T)^2}{V^2} + \frac{(nRT)^2 (\Delta V)^2}{V^4} $$  

Factor out $\frac{(nR)^2}{V^2}$:  
$$ (\Delta P)^2 = \frac{(nR)^2}{V^2} \left[ (\Delta T)^2 + \frac{T^2 (\Delta V)^2}{V^2} \right] $$  

Recall that $P = \frac{nRT}{V}$, so:  
$$ P^2 = \left( \frac{nRT}{V} \right)^2 = \frac{(nR)^2 T^2}{V^2} $$  

Divide both sides of the uncertainty equation by $P^2$:  
$$ \frac{(\Delta P)^2}{P^2} = \frac{ \frac{(nR)^2}{V^2} \left[ (\Delta T)^2 + \frac{T^2 (\Delta V)^2}{V^2} \right] }{ \frac{(nR)^2 T^2}{V^2} } $$  
Simplify:  
$$ \frac{(\Delta P)^2}{P^2} = \frac{ (\Delta T)^2 + \frac{T^2 (\Delta V)^2}{V^2} }{ T^2 } $$  
$$ \frac{(\Delta P)^2}{P^2} = \frac{(\Delta T)^2}{T^2} + \frac{(\Delta V)^2}{V^2} $$  

Thus, the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta P}{P}$ is the square root of this expression:  
$$ \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 } $$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta V}{V} \right)^2 }}$$

### Problem 53
##### Background
In physics experiments, the acceleration due to gravity $g$ is often determined using a simple pendulum. The relationship is given by $g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}$, where $L$ is the pendulum's length and $T$ is its oscillation period. Experimental measurements always involve uncertainties: length is measured as $L \pm \Delta L$, and period as $T \pm \Delta T$. To assess the reliability of the calculated $g$, we must analyze how these uncertainties propagate through the formula.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Relative uncertainty definition and calculation
- Error propagation for multiplicative and power-law functions

- Root-sum-square combination of independent uncertainties

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

- Extends measurement techniques from kinematics to gravitational physics
- Reinforces dimensional analysis (verifying consistency of $g$'s units)

##### Interdisciplinary Connections

- Monitoring ground stability in civil engineering
- Validating satellite-based gravity measurements (e.g., GOCE mission)

##### Problem Statement
A student measures a pendulum's length as $L \pm \Delta L$ and period as $T \pm \Delta T$. Using the formula $g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}$, derive an expression for the **relative uncertainty** $\frac{\Delta g}{g}$ in terms of the relative uncertainties $\frac{\Delta L}{L}$ and $\frac{\Delta T}{T}$. Assume $\Delta L$ and $\Delta T$ are independent random errors.  

Express your final answer as a single analytic expression using only the symbols for the relative uncertainties in $L$ and $T$. Do not include any absolute uncertainty terms ($\Delta L$, $\Delta T$) in the final expression.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta g}{g}$, we start with the function $g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}$. The relative uncertainty is derived using the general formula for error propagation when variables are independent:


$$
\left(\frac{\Delta g}{g}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial L} \frac{\Delta L}{g}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial T} \frac{\Delta T}{g}\right)^2
$$


First, compute the partial derivatives of $g$ with respect to $L$ and $T$:


$$
\frac{\partial g}{\partial L} = \frac{\partial}{\partial L} \left( \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2} \right) = \frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}
$$



$$
\frac{\partial g}{\partial T} = \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \left( \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2} \right) = 4\pi^2 L \cdot (-2)T^{-3} = -\frac{8\pi^2 L}{T^3}
$$


Now substitute these into the error propagation formula:


$$
\left(\frac{\Delta g}{g}\right)^2 = \left( \frac{\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2} \cdot \Delta L}{g} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{-\frac{8\pi^2 L}{T^3} \cdot \Delta T}{g} \right)^2
$$


Replace $g$ with $\frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}$ in the denominators:


$$
\left(\frac{\Delta g}{g}\right)^2 = \left( \frac{\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2} \cdot \Delta L}{\frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{-\frac{8\pi^2 L}{T^3} \cdot \Delta T}{\frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}} \right)^2
$$


Simplify each term:


$$
\text{First term: } \frac{\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2} \cdot \Delta L}{\frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}} = \frac{\Delta L}{L}
$$



$$
\text{Second term: } \frac{-\frac{8\pi^2 L}{T^3} \cdot \Delta T}{\frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}} = -\frac{8\pi^2 L \Delta T}{T^3} \cdot \frac{T^2}{4\pi^2 L} = -2 \frac{\Delta T}{T}
$$


Thus:


$$
\left(\frac{\Delta g}{g}\right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 + \left( -2 \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right)^2
$$


Taking the square root gives the relative uncertainty:


$$
\frac{\Delta g}{g} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right)^2 }
$$


This expression shows that the relative uncertainty in $g$ depends on the relative uncertainties in $L$ and $T$, with the period uncertainty contributing four times more heavily due to the $T^{-2}$ dependence in $g$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right)^2 }}$$

### Problem 54
##### Background
In scientific measurements, every physical quantity is subject to uncertainty due to limitations in measurement instruments or techniques. When deriving new quantities from measured values, we must propagate these uncertainties using mathematical principles. Consider a scenario where you're calculating the radius of a circular object from its measured area, or determining the speed of an object from its kinetic energy—both require taking square roots of measured values. Understanding how uncertainty propagates through such operations is essential for accurate data analysis.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

- Derivative-based uncertainty propagation for functions of one variable
- Application of the chain rule in error analysis
- Simplification of uncertainty expressions

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to calculus concepts (derivatives as sensitivity coefficients) and foundational measurement theory. It also extends to statistical methods for combining uncertainties in multivariable systems, which builds upon the single-variable case presented here.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Uncertainty propagation is vital in engineering (tolerance analysis), economics (risk modeling of derived financial indicators), and environmental science (error estimation in pollution dispersion models). The square-root function specifically appears in signal processing (root-mean-square calculations) and quantum mechanics (wavefunction normalization).

##### Real-World Applications
- Determining uncertainty in the radius of a planet from telescopic area measurements
- Calculating speed uncertainty in radar systems using Doppler shift energy measurements
- Estimating dose uncertainties in medical imaging where intensity follows inverse-square laws

##### Problem Statement
A physical quantity $x$ is measured with an absolute uncertainty $\Delta x$, meaning the true value lies in the interval $[x - \Delta x, x + \Delta x]$. The derived quantity $y$ is defined as the square root of $x$:  
$$ y = \sqrt{x} $$  
Derive an analytic expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta y$ in terms of $x$ and $\Delta x$. Assume $x > 0$ and $\Delta x > 0$.  

Express your final answer as a single simplified fraction using the variables $x$ and $\Delta x$. Use the notation $\Delta y = $ [expression], and ensure all square roots are denoted with the \sqrt{} command.

### Solution
To determine the absolute uncertainty $\Delta y$ in $y = \sqrt{x}$ given the absolute uncertainty $\Delta x$ in $x$, we apply the derivative-based propagation formula for a function of one variable. The general rule states:  
$$ \Delta y \approx \left| \frac{dy}{dx} \right| \Delta x $$  

**Step 1: Compute the derivative**  
Given $y = x^{1/2}$, the derivative with respect to $x$ is:  
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} $$  

**Step 2: Apply the uncertainty formula**  
Substitute the derivative into the propagation formula:  
$$ \Delta y \approx \left| \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} \right| \Delta x $$  
Since $x > 0$, the expression inside the absolute value is positive, so we can drop the absolute value:  
$$ \Delta y \approx \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} \Delta x $$  

**Step 3: Simplify the expression**  
Rewrite the expression as a single fraction:  
$$ \Delta y \approx \frac{\Delta x}{2\sqrt{x}} $$  

This is the analytic expression for the absolute uncertainty in $y$. The result shows that $\Delta y$ is proportional to $\Delta x$ and inversely proportional to the square root of $x$, indicating that uncertainty decreases as $x$ increases for a fixed $\Delta x$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\Delta x}{2\sqrt{x}}}$$

##### Background
In electronic circuit design, precise resistance values are critical for functionality. Resistors are manufactured with inherent tolerances, leading to uncertainties in their resistance values. When resistors are connected in series, the total resistance is the sum of individual resistances, but the uncertainty in the total resistance must be calculated using statistical methods to account for error propagation. This ensures accurate predictions of circuit behavior.

Each resistor has an associated absolute uncertainty: $\Delta R_1$ for $R_1$, $\Delta R_2$ for $R_2$, and $\Delta R_3$ for $R_3$. These uncertainties arise from manufacturing tolerances and are statistically independent. Derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $\Delta R_{\text{total}}$ in the total resistance $R_{\text{total}}$. Express $\Delta R_{\text{total}}$ symbolically in terms of $\Delta R_1$, $\Delta R_2$, and $\Delta R_3$ only.  
**Format Requirements**:  
1. Use the notation $\Delta R_{\text{total}}$ for the final uncertainty.  
2. Express the answer as a single analytic expression under a square root.  
3. Do not include $R_1$, $R_2$, or $R_3$ in the final expression.

### Solution
The total resistance for resistors in series is given by:  
$$ R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3. $$  
The absolute uncertainty $\Delta R_{\text{total}}$ depends on the uncertainties $\Delta R_1$, $\Delta R_2$, and $\Delta R_3$. Since the uncertainties are independent, the general formula for the uncertainty in a sum is:  
$$ \Delta f = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \Delta x \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \Delta y \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \Delta z \right)^2 }, $$  
where $f$ is a function of independent variables $x$, $y$, and $z$. Here, $f = R_{\text{total}}$, with $x = R_1$, $y = R_2$, and $z = R_3$.  

Compute the partial derivatives:  
$$ \frac{\partial R_{\text{total}}}{\partial R_1} = 1, \quad \frac{\partial R_{\text{total}}}{\partial R_2} = 1, \quad \frac{\partial R_{\text{total}}}{\partial R_3} = 1. $$  

Substitute into the uncertainty formula:  
$$ \Delta R_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{ \left(1 \cdot \Delta R_1\right)^2 + \left(1 \cdot \Delta R_2\right)^2 + \left(1 \cdot \Delta R_3\right)^2 }. $$  

Simplify the expression:  
$$ \Delta R_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{ (\Delta R_1)^2 + (\Delta R_2)^2 + (\Delta R_3)^2 }. $$  

This is the absolute uncertainty in the total resistance, derived from the quadratic sum of individual uncertainties due to their statistical independence.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ (\Delta R_1)^2 + (\Delta R_2)^2 + (\Delta R_3)^2 }}$$

### Problem 56
##### Background
In precision manufacturing, engineers must calculate the volume of rectangular components to ensure they meet design specifications. Consider a rectangular prism with length $ l $, width $ w $, and height $ h $, each measured independently with associated absolute uncertainties $ \Delta l $, $ \Delta w $, and $ \Delta h $. These uncertainties arise from measurement instrument limitations (e.g., caliper resolution) and environmental factors. The volume $ V $ is given by $ V = l w h $. Understanding how uncertainties propagate to the volume is crucial for quality control and tolerance analysis.

##### Problem Statement
Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty $ \frac{\Delta V}{V} $ in the volume $ V = l w h $ of a rectangular prism, given independent uncertainties $ \Delta l $, $ \Delta w $, and $ \Delta h $ in the dimensions $ l $, $ w $, and $ h $. Use the general formula for uncertainty propagation in multivariable functions. Express your final answer as an analytic expression in terms of the relative uncertainties $ \frac{\Delta l}{l} $, $ \frac{\Delta w}{w} $, and $ \frac{\Delta h}{h} $. Show all steps of the derivation explicitly.

### Solution
The relative uncertainty in $ V $ is derived using the general uncertainty propagation formula for a function of independent variables. For $ V = f(l, w, h) $, the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta V $ is:
$$
\Delta V = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial l} \Delta l \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial w} \Delta w \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial h} \Delta h \right)^2 }
$$
The partial derivatives of $ V = l w h $ are:
$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial l} = w h, \quad \frac{\partial V}{\partial w} = l h, \quad \frac{\partial V}{\partial h} = l w
$$
Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:
$$
\Delta V = \sqrt{ (w h \cdot \Delta l)^2 + (l h \cdot \Delta w)^2 + (l w \cdot \Delta h)^2 }
$$
The relative uncertainty $ \frac{\Delta V}{V} $ is obtained by dividing $ \Delta V $ by $ V = l w h $:
$$
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{ \sqrt{ (w h \Delta l)^2 + (l h \Delta w)^2 + (l w \Delta h)^2 } }{l w h}
$$
Simplify the expression under the square root:
$$
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \sqrt{ \frac{ (w h \Delta l)^2 }{ (l w h)^2 } + \frac{ (l h \Delta w)^2 }{ (l w h)^2 } + \frac{ (l w \Delta h)^2 }{ (l w h)^2 } }
$$
Each term reduces to:
$$
\frac{ (w h \Delta l)^2 }{ (l w h)^2 } = \left( \frac{\Delta l}{l} \right)^2, \quad \frac{ (l h \Delta w)^2 }{ (l w h)^2 } = \left( \frac{\Delta w}{w} \right)^2, \quad \frac{ (l w \Delta h)^2 }{ (l w h)^2 } = \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2
$$
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
$$
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta l}{l} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta w}{w} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 }
$$
This is the relative uncertainty in the volume.

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta l}{l} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta w}{w} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 } }$$

### Problem 57
##### Background
In a physics laboratory experiment, students are determining the specific heat capacity of an unknown metal sample. The specific heat capacity $c$ is calculated using the formula $c = \frac{Q}{m \Delta T}$, where $Q$ is the heat energy transferred to the sample, $m$ is its mass, and $\Delta T$ is its temperature change. The measured values and their uncertainties are:
- Heat energy: $Q \pm \Delta Q$
- Mass: $m \pm \Delta m$
- Temperature change: $\Delta T \pm \Delta(\Delta T)$

Uncertainty analysis is essential for evaluating the reliability of experimental results, as errors propagate through calculations. This requires understanding how uncertainties in measured quantities affect derived quantities.

##### Knowledge Points Tested

##### Intradisciplinary Connections

- Climate science (calibrating temperature sensors in environmental monitoring)

##### Problem Statement
Derive the expression for the **relative uncertainty** $\frac{\Delta c}{c}$ in the specific heat capacity $c = \frac{Q}{m \Delta T}$, given independent uncertainties $\Delta Q$, $\Delta m$, and $\Delta(\Delta T)$. Express your result as a symbolic expression in terms of the relative uncertainties $\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$, $\frac{\Delta m}{m}$, and $\frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{\Delta T}$.  
*Final answer must be an analytic expression enclosed in \boxed{}.*

### Solution
The relative uncertainty in $c$ is given by the general formula for error propagation:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta c}{c} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial c}{\partial Q} \frac{\Delta Q}{c} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial c}{\partial m} \frac{\Delta m}{c} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial c}{\partial (\Delta T)} \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{c} \right)^2
$$
since $Q$, $m$, and $\Delta T$ are independent measured quantities.

First, compute the partial derivatives of $c = \frac{Q}{m \Delta T}$:
- Derivative with respect to $Q$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial c}{\partial Q} = \frac{1}{m \Delta T}
  $$
- Derivative with respect to $m$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial c}{\partial m} = -\frac{Q}{m^2 \Delta T}
  $$
- Derivative with respect to $\Delta T$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial c}{\partial (\Delta T)} = -\frac{Q}{m (\Delta T)^2}
  $$

Substitute these into the error propagation formula:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta c}{c} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{m \Delta T} \cdot \frac{\Delta Q}{c} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{Q}{m^2 \Delta T} \cdot \frac{\Delta m}{c} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{Q}{m (\Delta T)^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{c} \right)^2
$$

Simplify each term using $c = \frac{Q}{m \Delta T}$:
1. First term:
   $$
   \frac{1}{m \Delta T} \cdot \frac{\Delta Q}{c} = \frac{1}{m \Delta T} \cdot \frac{\Delta Q}{\frac{Q}{m \Delta T}} = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q}
   $$
   Thus, $\left( \frac{1}{m \Delta T} \frac{\Delta Q}{c} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2$.

2. Second term:
   $$
   -\frac{Q}{m^2 \Delta T} \cdot \frac{\Delta m}{c} = -\frac{Q}{m^2 \Delta T} \cdot \frac{\Delta m}{\frac{Q}{m \Delta T}} = -\frac{\Delta m}{m}
   $$
   Thus, $\left( -\frac{Q}{m^2 \Delta T} \frac{\Delta m}{c} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2$.

3. Third term:
   $$
   -\frac{Q}{m (\Delta T)^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{c} = -\frac{Q}{m (\Delta T)^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{\frac{Q}{m \Delta T}} = -\frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{\Delta T}
   $$
   Thus, $\left( -\frac{Q}{m (\Delta T)^2} \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{c} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{\Delta T} \right)^2$.

Combining all terms:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta c}{c} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{\Delta T} \right)^2
$$

Therefore, the relative uncertainty is:
$$
\frac{\Delta c}{c} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{\Delta T} \right)^2 }
$$

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^{2} + \left( \frac{\Delta(\Delta T)}{\Delta T} \right)^{2} }}$$

### Problem 58
##### Background
In optics, the magnification of a lens system quantifies how much larger or smaller an image appears compared to the object. When measuring the object distance $u$ and image distance $v$, experimental uncertainties arise due to limitations in measurement tools or techniques. The magnification is given by $m = v/u$, and understanding how uncertainties propagate through this calculation is essential for assessing result reliability.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Propagation of uncertainty for a quotient of measured quantities
- Calculation of relative uncertainty
- Partial derivatives in error analysis
- Independence of measurement errors

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
Connects to geometric optics (lens equations) and foundational calculus concepts (partial differentiation). Extends to uncertainty analysis in other physics formulas involving ratios, such as refractive index or density calculations.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Applies to engineering (tolerance analysis), chemistry (concentration determinations), and data science (error propagation in algorithmic computations). Essential in fields requiring precision instrumentation like astronomy or microscopy.

##### Real-World Applications
Used to evaluate measurement quality in optical device calibration (e.g., microscopes, telescopes), photolithography in semiconductor manufacturing, and medical imaging systems. Critical for determining acceptable error margins in experimental physics.

##### Problem Statement
A student measures the image distance $v$ of a lens system with absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$, and the object distance $u$ with absolute uncertainty $\Delta u$. The magnification is calculated as $m = v/u$.  
Derive an analytic expression for the relative uncertainty in the magnification, $\frac{\Delta m}{|m|}$, in terms of $u$, $v$, $\Delta u$, and $\Delta v$. Assume $\Delta u$ and $\Delta v$ are independent and random.  
Express your final answer as a single simplified expression using the given symbols.  
**Format Instructions**:  
- Use $\Delta u$ for uncertainty in $u$ and $\Delta v$ for uncertainty in $v$.  
- Write all fractions with the form $\frac{a}{b}$.  
- Express square roots as $\sqrt{...}$.

### Solution
The relative uncertainty in magnification $m$ is defined as $\frac{\Delta m}{|m|}$. Since $m = \frac{v}{u}$, we apply the general formula for propagation of uncertainty for a quotient. For a function $Q = \frac{x}{y}$, the relative uncertainty is:
$$
\frac{\Delta Q}{|Q|} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta x}{x} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta y}{y} \right)^2 }
$$
provided $x$ and $y$ have independent uncertainties.  

Here, $x = v$ and $y = u$, so:
$$
\frac{\Delta m}{|m|} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta u}{u} \right)^2 }
$$

This result is derived rigorously below using partial derivatives.  

**Step 1: Express $\Delta m$**  
The absolute uncertainty $\Delta m$ for $m(v,u) = \frac{v}{u}$ is given by:
$$
\Delta m = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial m}{\partial v} \Delta v \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial m}{\partial u} \Delta u \right)^2 }
$$

**Step 2: Compute partial derivatives**  
- $\frac{\partial m}{\partial v} = \frac{\partial}{\partial v} \left( \frac{v}{u} \right) = \frac{1}{u}$  
- $\frac{\partial m}{\partial u} = \frac{\partial}{\partial u} \left( \frac{v}{u} \right) = -\frac{v}{u^2}$  

**Step 3: Substitute into $\Delta m$**  
$$
\Delta m = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{1}{u} \cdot \Delta v \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{v}{u^2} \cdot \Delta u \right)^2 } = \sqrt{ \frac{(\Delta v)^2}{u^2} + \frac{v^2 (\Delta u)^2}{u^4} }
$$

**Step 4: Simplify the expression**  
Factor out $\frac{1}{u^2}$:
$$
\Delta m = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{u^2} \left( (\Delta v)^2 + \frac{v^2 (\Delta u)^2}{u^2} \right) } = \frac{1}{|u|} \sqrt{ (\Delta v)^2 + \left( \frac{v \Delta u}{u} \right)^2 }
$$

**Step 5: Compute relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta m}{|m|}$**  
Since $|m| = \left| \frac{v}{u} \right|$,  
$$
\frac{\Delta m}{|m|} = \frac{ \frac{1}{|u|} \sqrt{ (\Delta v)^2 + \left( \frac{v \Delta u}{u} \right)^2 } }{ \left| \frac{v}{u} \right| } = \frac{1}{|u|} \cdot \frac{|u|}{|v|} \sqrt{ (\Delta v)^2 + \frac{v^2 (\Delta u)^2}{u^2} } = \frac{1}{|v|} \sqrt{ (\Delta v)^2 + \frac{v^2 (\Delta u)^2}{u^2} }
$$

**Step 6: Factor and simplify**  
$$
\frac{\Delta m}{|m|} = \sqrt{ \frac{ (\Delta v)^2 }{v^2} + \frac{ (\Delta u)^2 }{u^2} } = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta u}{u} \right)^2 }
$$

This matches the initial quotient rule application. The relative uncertainty in $m$ is the square root of the sum of the squares of the relative uncertainties in $v$ and $u$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta u}{u} \right)^2 }}$$

### Problem 59
##### Background
In experimental physics, accurately determining electric fields is crucial for applications like designing particle accelerators or medical imaging devices. The electric field $E$ due to a point charge $Q$ at a distance $r$ is given by $E = kQ/r^2$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant. However, all measurements have inherent uncertainties: the charge is measured as $Q \pm \Delta Q$, and the distance as $r \pm \Delta r$. To assess the reliability of $E$, we need to quantify how these uncertainties propagate.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Propagation of relative uncertainties for functions involving products and powers.
- Partial derivatives and error analysis.
- Interpretation of absolute and relative uncertainties in physical formulas.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to inverse-square laws in electrostatics (e.g., gravitational fields) and extends to uncertainty analysis in experimental physics, such as verifying Coulomb's law or measuring fundamental constants.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
Error propagation is essential in engineering (e.g., sensor calibration), chemistry (concentration measurements), and data science (modeling noisy datasets). The mathematical framework applies to any system governed by power-law relationships.

##### Real-World Applications
- **Electronics**: Calibrating field strength in capacitors for memory devices.
- **Environmental Science**: Measuring atmospheric electric fields near thunderstorms.
- **Space Exploration**: Determining ion thruster performance using charge and distance uncertainties.

##### Problem Statement
Consider a point charge $Q$ with absolute uncertainty $\Delta Q$, and a distance $r$ with absolute uncertainty $\Delta r$. The electric field is $E = kQ/r^2$, where $k$ is an exact constant with no uncertainty. Derive an analytic expression for the **relative uncertainty** in $E$, denoted $\frac{\Delta E}{E}$. Use only the symbols $\Delta Q$, $Q$, $\Delta r$, and $r$ in your final expression. Explicitly state any assumptions about error independence.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta E}{E}$, we use error propagation for the function $E = kQ r^{-2}$. Since $k$ is exact, it does not contribute to the uncertainty. Assume $\Delta Q$ and $\Delta r$ are independent random errors. The relative uncertainty in $E$ is given by:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta E}{E} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial Q} \frac{\Delta Q}{E} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial r} \frac{\Delta r}{E} \right)^2.
$$

First, compute the partial derivatives:
- $\frac{\partial E}{\partial Q} = \frac{k}{r^2}$,
- $\frac{\partial E}{\partial r} = -2kQ r^{-3}$.

Now substitute into the error propagation formula:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta E}{E} \right)^2 = \left( \left( \frac{k}{r^2} \right) \frac{\Delta Q}{E} \right)^2 + \left( \left( -2kQ r^{-3} \right) \frac{\Delta r}{E} \right)^2.
$$

Replace $E$ with $kQ r^{-2}$ and simplify each term:
1. For the charge term:
   $$
   \left( \frac{k}{r^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta Q}{kQ r^{-2}} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2.
   $$
2. For the distance term:
   $$
   \left( -2kQ r^{-3} \cdot \frac{\Delta r}{kQ r^{-2}} \right)^2 = \left( -2 \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 = 4 \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2.
   $$

Combine both terms:
$$
\left( \frac{\Delta E}{E} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2.
$$

Thus, the relative uncertainty is:
$$
\frac{\Delta E}{E} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta r}{r} \right)^2 }.
$$

### Answer
$$
\boxed{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}\right)^{2} + 4\left(\frac{\Delta r}{r}\right)^{2}}}
$$

### Problem 6
##### Background
In experimental physics, accurately reporting measurements requires quantifying the uncertainty in derived quantities. Consider a scenario where a student measures the mass $m$ of a moving object with an absolute uncertainty $\Delta m$ and its speed $v$ with an absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$. The kinetic energy is calculated as $K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$. Since $K$ depends on both $m$ and $v$, its uncertainty arises from the propagation of errors in these independent measurements.

##### Knowledge Points Tested
- Error propagation for multivariable functions using partial derivatives.
- Calculation of relative uncertainty ($\frac{\Delta K}{K}$).
- Application of the root-sum-square (RSS) method for independent uncertainties.

##### Intradisciplinary Connections
This problem connects to differential calculus (partial derivatives) and statistics (variance of derived quantities). It also reinforces the concept of dimensional analysis, as the relative uncertainty must be dimensionless.

##### Interdisciplinary Connections
- **Engineering**: Uncertainty analysis is critical in designing systems with tolerances (e.g., aerospace components).
- **Chemistry**: Used in calculating uncertainties in derived quantities like reaction rates or energy changes.
- **Data Science**: RSS error propagation aligns with the Pythagorean theorem for independent random variables.

##### Real-World Applications
- In particle physics experiments, kinetic energy uncertainties affect the precision of mass measurements for subatomic particles.
- Automotive crash tests use high-speed cameras to measure $v$; combined with mass uncertainties, this determines the reliability of kinetic energy calculations for safety assessments.

##### Problem Statement
The kinetic energy of an object is given by $K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$, where $m$ is the mass and $v$ is the speed. The mass is measured with an absolute uncertainty $\Delta m$, and the speed is measured with an absolute uncertainty $\Delta v$. Assume the uncertainties in $m$ and $v$ are independent. Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty in the kinetic energy, $\frac{\Delta K}{K}$, in terms of the relative uncertainties $\frac{\Delta m}{m}$ and $\frac{\Delta v}{v}$.

### Solution
The relative uncertainty in $K$ is given by $\frac{\Delta K}{K}$. To find this, we use the root-sum-square (RSS) formula for error propagation in a function of two independent variables:  
$$ \Delta K = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial K}{\partial m} \Delta m \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial K}{\partial v} \Delta v \right)^2 } $$  
First, compute the partial derivatives of $K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$:  
$$ \frac{\partial K}{\partial m} = \frac{1}{2} v^2, \quad \frac{\partial K}{\partial v} = m v $$  
Substitute these into the RSS formula:  
$$ \Delta K = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{1}{2} v^2 \Delta m \right)^2 + \left( m v \Delta v \right)^2 } = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} v^4 (\Delta m)^2 + m^2 v^2 (\Delta v)^2 } $$  
The relative uncertainty is:  
$$ \frac{\Delta K}{K} = \frac{ \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} v^4 (\Delta m)^2 + m^2 v^2 (\Delta v)^2 } }{ \frac{1}{2} m v^2 } = \frac{2}{m v^2} \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} v^4 (\Delta m)^2 + m^2 v^2 (\Delta v)^2 } $$  
Simplify the expression inside the square root:  
$$ \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} v^4 (\Delta m)^2 + m^2 v^2 (\Delta v)^2 } = \sqrt{ v^2 \left( \frac{1}{4} v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + m^2 (\Delta v)^2 \right) } = v \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + m^2 (\Delta v)^2 } $$  
Thus,  
$$ \frac{\Delta K}{K} = \frac{2}{m v^2} \cdot v \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + m^2 (\Delta v)^2 } = \frac{2}{m v} \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + m^2 (\Delta v)^2 } $$  
Factor out $\frac{1}{4}$ from the square root:  
$$ \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + m^2 (\Delta v)^2 } = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{4} \left( v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + 4 m^2 (\Delta v)^2 \right) } = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + 4 m^2 (\Delta v)^2 } $$  
Now,  
$$ \frac{\Delta K}{K} = \frac{2}{m v} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + 4 m^2 (\Delta v)^2 } = \frac{1}{m v} \sqrt{ v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + 4 m^2 (\Delta v)^2 } $$  
Divide both terms inside the square root by $m^2 v^2$:  
$$ \frac{ \sqrt{ v^2 (\Delta m)^2 + 4 m^2 (\Delta v)^2 } }{m v} = \sqrt{ \frac{ v^2 (\Delta m)^2 }{m^2 v^2} + \frac{ 4 m^2 (\Delta v)^2 }{m^2 v^2} } = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 } $$  
Therefore,  
$$ \frac{\Delta K}{K} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 } $$  
This expression shows that the relative uncertainty in $K$ is the root-sum-square of the relative uncertainty in $m$ and twice the relative uncertainty in $v$.

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta m}{m} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\Delta v}{v} \right)^2 } }$$

### Problem 7
##### Background
In a geological survey, two rock layers are measured for their thicknesses using seismic reflection. The thickness of the upper layer is recorded as $ x \pm \Delta x $, and the thickness of the lower layer as $ y \pm \Delta y $. Geologists need to compute the difference in thickness between these layers to analyze sediment deposition rates. The absolute uncertainty in this difference must be quantified to assess the reliability of the conclusion.

##### Problem Statement
Given two independent measurements $ x \pm \Delta x $ and $ y \pm \Delta y $, derive an expression for the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta d $ in the difference $ d = x - y $. Use worst-case scenario analysis to ensure the result bounds the maximum possible error. Express $ \Delta d $ solely in terms of $ \Delta x $ and $ \Delta y $.  
*Assume errors are independent and symmetrically distributed about the measured values.*

### Solution
To derive the absolute uncertainty $ \Delta d $ for $ d = x - y $, consider the extreme values each measurement can take within their uncertainty intervals.  
- The maximum value of $ x $ is $ x + \Delta x $, and the minimum value of $ y $ is $ y - \Delta y $.  
- The minimum value of $ x $ is $ x - \Delta x $, and the maximum value of $ y $ is $ y + \Delta y $.  

The difference $ d = x - y $ will be maximized when $ x $ is maximized and $ y $ is minimized:  

$$
d_{\text{max}} = (x + \Delta x) - (y - \Delta y) = x - y + \Delta x + \Delta y.
$$
  
Similarly, $ d $ will be minimized when $ x $ is minimized and $ y $ is maximized:  

$$
d_{\text{min}} = (x - \Delta x) - (y + \Delta y) = x - y - \Delta x - \Delta y.
$$
  
The central value of $ d $ is $ x - y $. The deviation of $ d $ from this central value ranges from $ -\Delta d $ to $ +\Delta d $, where $ \Delta d $ is the absolute uncertainty. The maximum deviation observed is:  
- Upper deviation: $ d_{\text{max}} - (x - y) = \Delta x + \Delta y $  
- Lower deviation: $ (x - y) - d_{\text{min}} = \Delta x + \Delta y $  

Thus, the worst-case deviation in either direction is $ \Delta x + \Delta y $. The absolute uncertainty $ \Delta d $ is defined as this maximum deviation:  

$$
\Delta d = \Delta x + \Delta y.
$$
  
This result holds under the assumption of independence and symmetric error distributions, ensuring $ \Delta d $ bounds the error for all possible combinations of $ x $ and $ y $ within their intervals.

### Problem 8
##### Background
In physics experiments, measuring acceleration due to gravity ($g$) often involves timing the fall of an object from a known height. The formula $g = 2h/t^2$ connects height $h$, time $t$, and gravitational acceleration. Experimental measurements always have uncertainties: height is measured with absolute uncertainty $\Delta h$, and time with absolute uncertainty $\Delta t$. Understanding how these uncertainties propagate to the final result is essential for evaluating experimental reliability.

##### Problem Statement  
A student determines gravitational acceleration using $g = 2h/t^2$, where $h$ is the drop height and $t$ is the fall time. The height measurement has absolute uncertainty $\Delta h$, and the time measurement has absolute uncertainty $\Delta t$. Assume $\Delta h$ and $\Delta t$ are independent and random. Derive an expression for the relative uncertainty in $g$, denoted $\frac{\Delta g}{g}$.  

Express your answer analytically in terms of $h$, $t$, $\Delta h$, and $\Delta t$. Finalize the expression under a square root and simplify all coefficients.

### Solution
The relative uncertainty in $g$ is defined as $\frac{\Delta g}{g}$. Given $g = 2h t^{-2}$, we apply the general error propagation formula for a function $f(x,y)$:  

$$
\left(\frac{\Delta f}{f}\right)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \frac{\Delta x}{f} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{\Delta y}{f} \right)^2
$$

Here, $f \equiv g$, $x \equiv h$, and $y \equiv t$. First, compute the partial derivatives:  

$$
\frac{\partial g}{\partial h} = \frac{2}{t^2}, \quad \frac{\partial g}{\partial t} = 2h \cdot (-2)t^{-3} = -\frac{4h}{t^3}.
$$

Substitute into the error propagation formula:  

$$
\left(\frac{\Delta g}{g}\right)^2 = \left( \frac{2}{t^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta h}{g} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{4h}{t^3} \cdot \frac{\Delta t}{g} \right)^2.
$$

Replace $g$ with $2h/t^2$ in the denominators:  

$$
\left(\frac{\Delta g}{g}\right)^2 = \left( \frac{2}{t^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta h}{\frac{2h}{t^2}} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{4h}{t^3} \cdot \frac{\Delta t}{\frac{2h}{t^2}} \right)^2.
$$

Simplify each term:  

- First term:  
  $$
  \frac{2}{t^2} \cdot \frac{\Delta h}{\frac{2h}{t^2}} = \frac{2}{t^2} \cdot \Delta h \cdot \frac{t^2}{2h} = \frac{\Delta h}{h}.
  $$
  
- Second term:  
  $$
  -\frac{4h}{t^3} \cdot \frac{\Delta t}{\frac{2h}{t^2}} = -\frac{4h}{t^3} \cdot \Delta t \cdot \frac{t^2}{2h} = -\frac{4}{2} \cdot \frac{\Delta t}{t} = -2 \frac{\Delta t}{t}.
  $$

Thus:  

$$
\left(\frac{\Delta g}{g}\right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 + \left( -2 \frac{\Delta t}{t} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta t}{t} \right)^2.
$$

Taking the square root gives the relative uncertainty:  

$$
\frac{\Delta g}{g} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta t}{t} \right)^2 }.
$$

This is the final expression.

### Answer
$$\boxed{ \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)^2 + 4 \left( \frac{\Delta t}{t} \right)^2 } }$$

### Problem 9
##### Background  
In physics experiments, Hooke's law describes the behavior of springs: the force $F$ required to stretch or compress a spring by a distance $x$ is proportional to that distance, $F = kx$, where $k$ is the spring constant. When measuring $F$ and $x$ experimentally, uncertainties arise due to instrument precision. The force measurement has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta F$, and the displacement measurement has an absolute uncertainty $\Delta x$. These uncertainties propagate to the calculated spring constant $k = F/x$. Understanding how uncertainties combine is essential for reliable experimental conclusions.

##### Problem Statement  
A student measures the force $F$ applied to a spring and the resulting displacement $x$ to determine the spring constant $k = F/x$. The absolute uncertainty in the force measurement is $\Delta F$, and the absolute uncertainty in the displacement measurement is $\Delta x$. Assume the uncertainties in $F$ and $x$ are independent and random. Derive an expression for the **relative uncertainty in the spring constant**, $\frac{\Delta k}{k}$, in terms of $F$, $x$, $\Delta F$, and $\Delta x$.  

Express your answer as a single analytic expression using the variables $F$, $x$, $\Delta F$, and $\Delta x$. Use $\frac{a}{b}$ for fractions and $\sqrt{\ldots}$ for square roots. Do not simplify or substitute numerical values.

### Solution
To find the relative uncertainty $\frac{\Delta k}{k}$, start with the formula for the spring constant:  
$$ k = \frac{F}{x}. $$  
Since $k$ is a function of two variables, $F$ and $x$, the absolute uncertainty $\Delta k$ is given by the root-sum-square of the partial derivatives:  
$$ (\Delta k)^2 = \left( \frac{\partial k}{\partial F} \Delta F \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial k}{\partial x} \Delta x \right)^2. $$  
First, compute the partial derivatives:  
$$ \frac{\partial k}{\partial F} = \frac{\partial}{\partial F} \left( \frac{F}{x} \right) = \frac{1}{x}, $$  
$$ \frac{\partial k}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{F}{x} \right) = -\frac{F}{x^2}. $$  
Substitute these into the uncertainty formula:  
$$ (\Delta k)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{x} \cdot \Delta F \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{F}{x^2} \cdot \Delta x \right)^2 = \frac{(\Delta F)^2}{x^2} + \frac{F^2 (\Delta x)^2}{x^4}. $$  
The relative uncertainty is $\frac{\Delta k}{k}$. Since $k = \frac{F}{x}$, we have:  
$$ \frac{\Delta k}{k} = \frac{\Delta k}{\frac{F}{x}} = \frac{x \cdot \Delta k}{F}. $$  
To express $\left( \frac{\Delta k}{k} \right)^2$, square both sides:  
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta k}{k} \right)^2 = \frac{(x \cdot \Delta k)^2}{F^2} = \frac{x^2}{F^2} \cdot (\Delta k)^2. $$  
Substitute the expression for $(\Delta k)^2$:  
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta k}{k} \right)^2 = \frac{x^2}{F^2} \left( \frac{(\Delta F)^2}{x^2} + \frac{F^2 (\Delta x)^2}{x^4} \right) = \frac{x^2}{F^2} \cdot \frac{(\Delta F)^2}{x^2} + \frac{x^2}{F^2} \cdot \frac{F^2 (\Delta x)^2}{x^4}. $$  
Simplify each term:  
$$ \frac{x^2}{F^2} \cdot \frac{(\Delta F)^2}{x^2} = \frac{(\Delta F)^2}{F^2}, $$  
$$ \frac{x^2}{F^2} \cdot \frac{F^2 (\Delta x)^2}{x^4} = \frac{(\Delta x)^2}{x^2}. $$  
Thus,  
$$ \left( \frac{\Delta k}{k} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta x}{x} \right)^2. $$  
Take the square root to obtain the relative uncertainty:  
$$ \frac{\Delta k}{k} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta x}{x} \right)^2 }. $$  
This is the expression for the relative uncertainty in $k$.

$$\boxed{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta F}{F} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta x}{x} \right)^2 }}$$
