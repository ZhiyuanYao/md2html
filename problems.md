## Problem 1

**Topic**: mass spectrometer principles (4)

**Thumbnail**: After acceleration through voltage $V$, an ion enters perpendicular to magnetic field $B$; express its path radius $r$ in terms of $m$, $q$, $V$, and $B$.

### Problem

In a mass spectrometer, ions are accelerated from rest through an electric potential difference of $V$. After acceleration, an ion of mass $m$ and charge $q$ enters a region of uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$ perpendicular to the field direction. The ion subsequently follows a circular trajectory of radius $r$. 

Derive an expression for the radius $r$ in terms of $m$, $q$, $V$, and $B$. 

Your final answer must be a closed-form analytic expression using only the given symbolic variables. Express the answer in the simplest exact form, using standard mathematical notation. Specifically:
- Use $\exp(x)$ for exponential functions if needed (though not required here).
- For square roots, use $\sqrt{...}$.
- Write fractions with $\frac{numerator}{denominator}$.
- For exponents, use the caret with curly braces (e.g., $B^{2}$).

Do not include numerical values, units, or any other constants. The problem is purely symbolic.

### Solution

**Step 1: Relate kinetic energy to acceleration voltage**  
The ion starts from rest and is accelerated through a potential difference $V$. The kinetic energy gained equals the loss in electric potential energy:  
$$\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} = q V$$  
where $v$ is the speed of the ion upon entering the magnetic field. Solve for $v^{2}$:  
$$v^{2} = \frac{2 q V}{m}$$  

**Step 2: Equate magnetic force to centripetal force**  
The ion moves perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field $B$. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force for circular motion:  
$$q v B = \frac{m v^{2}}{r}$$  
where $r$ is the radius of the circular path.  

**Step 3: Solve for the radius $r$**  
Rearrange the force equation to isolate $r$:  
$$r = \frac{m v}{q B}$$  

**Step 4: Eliminate $v$ using the energy relation**  
Substitute $v$ from Step 1 into the expression for $r$. First, express $v$ as:  
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2 q V}{m}}$$  
Substitute:  
$$r = \frac{m}{q B} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2 q V}{m}}$$  

**Step 5: Simplify the expression**  
Combine terms under the square root:  
$$r = \frac{m}{q B} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2 q V}{m}} = \frac{1}{B} \sqrt{\frac{m^{2}}{q^{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2 q V}{m}} = \frac{1}{B} \sqrt{\frac{m^{2} \cdot 2 q V}{q^{2} m}} = \frac{1}{B} \sqrt{\frac{2 m V}{q}}$$  
Alternatively, write as a single square root:  
$$r = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{1}{B} \right)^{2} \cdot \frac{2 m V}{q} } = \sqrt{ \frac{2 m V}{q B^{2}} }$$  
Both forms are equivalent, but the latter is standard. Thus:  
$$r = \sqrt{\frac{2 m V}{q B^{2}}}$$

### Answer

$$\boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{2 m V}{q B^{2}}}}$$

## Problem 2

**Topic**: energy loss due to friction (1)

**Thumbnail**: A crate slides down a $30^\circ$ incline with friction coefficient $\mu$; derive its velocity at the bottom if released from rest at height $h$.

### Problem

A crate of mass $m$ slides down an incline that makes an angle $\theta$ (in radians) with the horizontal. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the incline is $\mu$. The crate is released from rest at a vertical height $h$ above the bottom of the incline. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$. Derive an expression for the speed of the crate when it reaches the bottom of the incline.

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $g$, $h$, $\mu$, and $\theta$. Use standard mathematical notation for trigonometric functions and omit the degree symbol for any trigonometric evaluations. Ensure all physical quantities are expressed in consistent units.

### Solution

The forces acting on the crate are gravity, the normal force, and kinetic friction. The component of gravity parallel to the incline is $mg \sin\theta$, while the normal force balances the perpendicular component: $N = mg \cos\theta$. The kinetic friction force is $f_k = \mu N = \mu mg \cos\theta$.

The work-energy theorem states that the net work done on the crate equals its change in kinetic energy:
$$
W_{\text{net}} = \Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - 0
$$
since the crate starts from rest. The net work is the sum of the work done by gravity and friction. 

The distance traveled along the incline, $s$, relates to the height $h$ by:
$$
s = \frac{h}{\sin\theta}
$$
Work done by gravity (parallel component) is positive:
$$
W_g = (mg \sin\theta) \cdot s = mg \sin\theta \cdot \frac{h}{\sin\theta} = mgh
$$
Work done by friction is negative and opposes motion:
$$
W_f = -f_k \cdot s = -(\mu mg \cos\theta) \cdot \frac{h}{\sin\theta} = -\mu mgh \cot\theta
$$
The net work is:
$$
W_{\text{net}} = W_g + W_f = mgh - \mu mgh \cot\theta = mgh(1 - \mu \cot\theta)
$$
Equate to the change in kinetic energy:
$$
mgh(1 - \mu \cot\theta) = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
Solve for $v$:
$$
v^2 = 2gh(1 - \mu \cot\theta)
$$
Take the positive square root for speed:
$$
v = \sqrt{2gh(1 - \mu \cot\theta)}
$$
This expression is valid when $1 - \mu \cot\theta > 0$ (i.e., $\mu < \tan\theta$), ensuring motion occurs.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\sqrt{2gh\left(1 - \mu \cot \theta\right)}}$$

## Problem 3

**Topic**: thermal equilibrium and zeroth law (0)

**Thumbnail**: A 100 g copper block at 90¬∞C is placed in 200 g of water at 25¬∞C; calculate the equilibrium temperature.

### Problem

In a calorimetry experiment, a copper calorimeter of mass $ m_c $ contains water of mass $ m_w $. The specific heat capacity of copper is $ c_c $, and that of water is $ c_w $. Initially, the calorimeter and water are at temperature $ T_w $. A copper block of mass $ m_b $ at temperature $ T_b $ is placed into the water. The system is isolated from the surroundings. Derive an expression for the equilibrium temperature $ T $ of the entire system.

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $ m_c $, $ m_w $, $ c_c $, $ c_w $, $ T_w $, and $ m_b $, $ T_b $. Use standard mathematical notation: fractions must be written with \frac{numerator}{denominator}, and exponents with \text{base}^{\text{exponent}} inside curly braces. Do not substitute any numerical values.

### Solution

The system reaches thermal equilibrium when the heat lost by the copper block equals the heat gained by the calorimeter and water. The heat transfer is governed by the principle of conservation of energy in an isolated system.

The heat lost by the copper block as it cools from $ T_b $ to $ T $ is:

$$ Q_{\text{block}} = m_b c_c (T_b - T) $$


The heat gained by the copper calorimeter as it warms from $ T_w $ to $ T $ is:

$$ Q_{\text{cal}} = m_c c_c (T - T_w) $$


The heat gained by the water as it warms from $ T_w $ to $ T $ is:

$$ Q_{\text{water}} = m_w c_w (T - T_w) $$


Since no heat is exchanged with the surroundings, the total heat gained by the calorimeter and water equals the heat lost by the block:

$$ Q_{\text{block}} = Q_{\text{cal}} + Q_{\text{water}} $$


$$ m_b c_c (T_b - T) = m_c c_c (T - T_w) + m_w c_w (T - T_w) $$


Factor the right-hand side:

$$ m_b c_c (T_b - T) = (m_c c_c + m_w c_w) (T - T_w) $$


Expand both sides:

$$ m_b c_c T_b - m_b c_c T = (m_c c_c + m_w c_w) T - (m_c c_c + m_w c_w) T_w $$


Group all terms involving $ T $ on one side and constant terms on the other:

$$ m_b c_c T_b + (m_c c_c + m_w c_w) T_w = m_b c_c T + (m_c c_c + m_w c_w) T $$


$$ m_b c_c T_b + (m_c c_c + m_w c_w) T_w = T \left( m_b c_c + m_c c_c + m_w c_w \right) $$


Solve for $ T $:

$$ T = \frac{ m_b c_c T_b + (m_c c_c + m_w c_w) T_w }{ m_b c_c + m_c c_c + m_w c_w } $$


Rewrite the numerator to combine like terms:

$$ T = \frac{ m_b c_c T_b + m_c c_c T_w + m_w c_w T_w }{ m_b c_c + m_c c_c + m_w c_w } $$

### Answer

\[ \boxed{ \dfrac{ m_{b} c_{c} T_{b} + m_{c} c_{c} T_{w} + m_{w} c_{w} T_{w} }{ m_{b} c_{c} + m_{c} c_{c} + m_{w} c_{w} } } \]

## Problem 4

**Topic**: dimensional analysis in problem solving (0)

**Thumbnail**: Determine the dimension of the universal gravitational constant G using Newton's law of universal gravitation $F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$.

### Problem

Newton's law of universal gravitation describes the gravitational force $F$ between two point masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ separated by a distance $r$, given by $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant. The dimensions of force $F$ are $[F] = M L T^{-2}$, where $M$ represents mass, $L$ represents length, and $T$ represents time. Determine the dimensional formula of $G$ by deriving its exponents for $M$, $L$, and $T$. Express your answer in the form $M^a L^b T^c$ and provide the explicit expression.

### Solution

To determine the dimensions of $G$, start with the given equation:  
$$ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$  
Express this relationship dimensionally. The dimension of force $[F]$ is $M L T^{-2}$. The dimensions of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both $M$, and the dimension of distance $r$ is $L$. Since $G$ is multiplied by $\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, the dimensional equation is:  
$$ [F] = [G] \cdot \frac{[m_1] [m_2]}{[r]^2} $$  
Substitute the known dimensions:  
$$ M L T^{-2} = [G] \cdot \frac{(M) \cdot (M)}{(L)^2} = [G] \cdot \frac{M^2}{L^2} $$  
Solve for $[G]$ by isolating it:  
$$ [G] = \frac{M L T^{-2} \cdot L^2}{M^2} $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ [G] = \frac{M L^3 T^{-2}}{M^2} = M^{1-2} L^{3} T^{-2} = M^{-1} L^{3} T^{-2} $$  
Thus, the dimensional formula of $G$ is $M^{-1} L^{3} T^{-2}$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{M^{-1} L^{3} T^{-2}}$$

## Problem 5

**Topic**: conservation of momentum in collisions (2)

**Thumbnail**: A 0.05 kg bullet strikes a 5 kg wooden block at rest; if the bullet embeds and the block moves at 2 m/s, what was the bullet's initial speed?

### Problem

A wooden block of mass $M$ is at rest on a horizontal surface with coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_k$. The block is attached to one end of a spring with spring constant $k$; the other end is anchored to a fixed wall. The spring is initially at its natural length. A bullet of mass $m$ is fired horizontally at the block and embeds itself completely. After the collision, the block (with embedded bullet) moves and compresses the spring. The maximum compression distance of the spring is measured to be $d$. Derive an expression for the initial speed of the bullet. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $m$, $M$, $\mu_k$, $k$, $d$, and $g$ (the acceleration due to gravity).

### Solution

**Stage 1: Inelastic Collision (Conservation of Momentum)**  
Let $v_b$ be the initial speed of the bullet. Since the block is initially at rest, conservation of momentum for the collision gives:  
$$ m v_b = (m + M) v_f $$  
where $v_f$ is the speed of the combined block-bullet system immediately after the collision. Solving for $v_f$:  
$$ v_f = \frac{m v_b}{m + M} \quad (1) $$  

**Stage 2: Post-Collision Motion (Work-Energy Theorem)**  
After the collision, the system moves a distance $d$ while compressing the spring and experiencing friction. At maximum compression $d$, the system is momentarily at rest. The work-energy theorem accounts for the non-conservative friction force:  
$$ W_{\text{nc}} = \Delta KE + \Delta PE_{\text{spring}} $$  
- Work done by friction: $W_{\text{nc}} = -\mu_k (m + M) g \cdot d$ (negative as friction opposes motion).  
- Change in kinetic energy: $\Delta KE = 0 - \frac{1}{2}(m + M) v_f^2 = -\frac{1}{2}(m + M) v_f^2$.  
- Change in spring potential energy: $\Delta PE_{\text{spring}} = \frac{1}{2} k d^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2} k d^2$.  

Substituting into the work-energy theorem:  
$$ -\mu_k (m + M) g d = -\frac{1}{2}(m + M) v_f^2 + \frac{1}{2} k d^2 $$  
Rearranging terms:  
$$ \frac{1}{2}(m + M) v_f^2 = \frac{1}{2} k d^2 + \mu_k (m + M) g d $$  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
$$ (m + M) v_f^2 = k d^2 + 2 \mu_k (m + M) g d $$  
Solve for $v_f^2$:  
$$ v_f^2 = \frac{k d^2}{m + M} + 2 \mu_k g d \quad (2) $$  

**Combine Results**  
Substitute $v_f$ from equation (1) into equation (2):  
$$ \left( \frac{m v_b}{m + M} \right)^2 = \frac{k d^2}{m + M} + 2 \mu_k g d $$  
$$ \frac{m^2 v_b^2}{(m + M)^2} = \frac{k d^2}{m + M} + 2 \mu_k g d $$  
Multiply both sides by $(m + M)^2$:  
$$ m^2 v_b^2 = (m + M)^2 \left( \frac{k d^2}{m + M} + 2 \mu_k g d \right) $$  
$$ m^2 v_b^2 = (m + M) k d^2 + 2 \mu_k g d (m + M)^2 $$  
Solve for $v_b$:  
$$ v_b^2 = \frac{(m + M) k d^2 + 2 \mu_k g d (m + M)^2}{m^2} $$  
$$ v_b = \frac{1}{m} \sqrt{ (m + M) k d^2 + 2 \mu_k g d (m + M)^2 } $$  
Factor $(m + M)$ inside the square root:  
$$ v_b = \frac{1}{m} \sqrt{ (m + M) \left[ k d^2 + 2 \mu_k g d (m + M) \right] } $$  
Alternatively, express as:  
$$ v_b = \frac{m + M}{m} \sqrt{ \frac{k d^2}{m + M} + 2 \mu_k g d } $$  
Both forms are equivalent, but the latter is more compact.

### Answer

$$\boxed{ \frac{m + M}{m} \sqrt{ \frac{k d^{2}}{m + M} + 2 \mu_k g d } }$$

## Problem 6

**Topic**: molar calculations and Avogadro number (1)

**Thumbnail**: Determine the mass in grams of 1.5 √ó 10¬≤¬≥ molecules of carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ).

### Problem

A sample of carbon dioxide gas (CO‚ÇÇ) is isolated in a container. The sample contains $N$ molecules. The atomic mass of carbon is $m_C$ (in atomic mass units), and the atomic mass of oxygen is $m_O$ (in atomic mass units). Avogadro's number, denoted $N_A$, is the number of molecules per mole of any substance.  

Derive an expression for the mass $m$ (in grams) of this carbon dioxide sample. Express your answer solely in terms of $N$, $m_C$, $m_O$, and $N_A$.

### Solution

To determine the mass $m$ of the CO‚ÇÇ sample, we start by finding the mass of one molecule of CO‚ÇÇ. Each CO‚ÇÇ molecule consists of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. Thus, the molecular mass $M_{\text{CO}_2}$ in atomic mass units is:  
$$ M_{\text{CO}_2} = m_C + 2m_O $$  

By definition, one mole of any substance has a mass in grams numerically equal to its molecular mass in atomic mass units. Therefore, the molar mass of CO‚ÇÇ (mass per mole) is:  
$$ \text{Molar mass of CO}_2 = (m_C + 2m_O) \ \text{g/mol} $$  

The number of moles $n$ in the sample is the total number of molecules $N$ divided by Avogadro's number $N_A$:  
$$ n = \frac{N}{N_A} $$  

The mass $m$ of the sample (in grams) is the number of moles multiplied by the molar mass:  
$$ m = n \times (m_C + 2m_O) $$  

Substituting the expression for $n$:  
$$ m = \left( \frac{N}{N_A} \right) \times (m_C + 2m_O) $$  

This simplifies to:  
$$ m = \frac{N (m_C + 2m_O)}{N_A} $$  

Thus, the mass of the sample in grams is given by the derived expression.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{N (m_C + 2m_O)}{N_A}}$$

## Problem 7

**Topic**: moment of inertia for various shapes (3)

**Thumbnail**: Calculate the moment of inertia of a thin circular hoop of mass $M$ and radius $R$ about an axis perpendicular to its plane and passing through its center.

### Problem

A thin circular hoop of radius $R$ and mass $M$ is made from a wire of uniform linear density. A straight wire segment of the same linear density is rigidly attached along a diameter of the hoop, forming a single rigid body. Determine the moment of inertia of this composite object about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the hoop and passing through its center. Express your answer in terms of $M$ and $R$.

### Solution

The composite object consists of two parts: the circular hoop and the diameter wire. We calculate the moment of inertia for each part separately and sum them.

**Part 1: Circular Hoop**  
- The hoop has mass $M$ and radius $R$.  
- Every mass element of the hoop is at a distance $R$ from the central axis.  
- The moment of inertia of a thin hoop about its central perpendicular axis is:  
  $$ I_{\text{hoop}} = \int r^2  dm = R^2 \int dm = M R^2 $$

**Part 2: Diameter Wire**  
- The linear density $\lambda$ of the wire is uniform and identical to that of the hoop.  
- The circumference of the hoop is $2\pi R$, so:  
  $$ \lambda = \frac{M}{2\pi R} $$  
- The diameter wire has length $2R$, so its mass is:  
  $$ m_{\text{d}} = \lambda \cdot 2R = \frac{M}{2\pi R} \cdot 2R = \frac{M}{\pi} $$  
- Set up a coordinate system with the origin at the center, and the diameter along the x-axis from $x = -R$ to $x = R$.  
- For a mass element $dm = \lambda  dx$ at position $x$, its perpendicular distance to the z-axis is $|x|$. The moment of inertia contribution is:  
  $$ dI_{\text{d}} = x^2  dm = x^2 \lambda  dx $$  
- Integrate along the entire diameter:  
  $$ I_{\text{d}} = \int_{-R}^{R} x^2 \lambda  dx = 2\lambda \int_{0}^{R} x^2  dx $$  
  since the integrand is even.  
- Compute the integral:  
  $$ \int_{0}^{R} x^2  dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{R} = \frac{R^3}{3} $$  
- Substitute $\lambda$:  
  $$ I_{\text{d}} = 2\lambda \cdot \frac{R^3}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \lambda R^3 = \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{M}{2\pi R} \right) R^3 = \frac{M R^2}{3\pi} $$

**Total Moment of Inertia**  
Sum the contributions:  
$$ I_{\text{total}} = I_{\text{hoop}} + I_{\text{d}} = M R^2 + \frac{M R^2}{3\pi} = M R^2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{3\pi} \right) $$

### Answer

$$\boxed{M R^{2} \left(1 + \frac{1}{3\pi}\right)}$$

## Problem 8

**Topic**: Young double-slit interference pattern (2)

**Thumbnail**: Find the distance from the central maximum to the fifth bright fringe if the slit separation is 0.4 mm, screen distance is 2 m, and wavelength is 650 nm.

### Problem

In a modified Young's double-slit experiment, the apparatus is submerged in a transparent liquid with refractive index $n$. The two parallel slits are separated by a distance $d$. A monochromatic light source (wavelength $\lambda$ in vacuum) illuminates the slits, and the interference pattern forms on a screen at distance $L$ from the slits. Determine the distance from the central maximum to the fifth bright fringe. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $\lambda$, $d$, $L$, and $n$.

### Solution

The condition for constructive interference (bright fringes) in a double-slit experiment is given by the path difference being an integer multiple of the wavelength in the medium. The wavelength in the liquid is $\lambda_{\text{liquid}} = \frac{\lambda}{n}$ due to the refractive index $n$. For the $m$-th bright fringe:

$$ d \sin \theta_m = m \lambda_{\text{liquid}} = m \frac{\lambda}{n} $$

where $\theta_m$ is the angle from the central axis to the $m$-th fringe. For small angles ($\theta_m \ll 1$ radian), the approximation $\sin \theta_m \approx \tan \theta_m = \frac{y_m}{L}$ holds, with $y_m$ being the fringe distance from the central maximum. Substituting:

$$ d \cdot \frac{y_m}{L} = m \frac{\lambda}{n} $$

Solving for $y_m$:

$$ y_m = \frac{m \lambda L}{n d} $$

For the fifth bright fringe, $m = 5$:

$$ y_5 = \frac{5 \lambda L}{n d} $$

Thus, the distance from the central maximum to the fifth bright fringe is $\frac{5 \lambda L}{n d}$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{5\lambda L}{n d}}$$

## Problem 9

**Topic**: negative work calculations (0)

**Thumbnail**: Calculate the work done by friction when a 10 kg box slides 5 m on a horizontal surface with a coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.4.

### Problem

A box of mass $m$ slides a total distance $d$ along a straight horizontal surface. The first half of this distance ($d/2$) has a coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_{k1}$, while the second half ($d/2$) has a coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_{k2}$. Calculate the total work done by kinetic friction on the box during the entire motion. Express your answer symbolically in terms of $m$, $g$ (acceleration due to gravity), $d$, $\mu_{k1}$, and $\mu_{k2}$.

### Solution

The work done by friction on the box is calculated by summing the work done over each segment of the path. Since friction opposes motion, the work is negative.  

**Step 1: Work done on the first segment (distance $d/2$)**  
- Normal force on a horizontal surface: $N_1 = mg$  
- Kinetic friction force: $f_{k1} = \mu_{k1} N_1 = \mu_{k1} mg$  
- Work done by friction: $W_1 = f_{k1} \cdot (d/2) \cdot \cos(180^\circ) = (\mu_{k1} mg) \cdot (d/2) \cdot (-1) = -\mu_{k1} mg \frac{d}{2}$  

**Step 2: Work done on the second segment (distance $d/2$)**  
- Normal force: $N_2 = mg$ (surface remains horizontal)  
- Kinetic friction force: $f_{k2} = \mu_{k2} N_2 = \mu_{k2} mg$  
- Work done by friction: $W_2 = f_{k2} \cdot (d/2) \cdot \cos(180^\circ) = (\mu_{k2} mg) \cdot (d/2) \cdot (-1) = -\mu_{k2} mg \frac{d}{2}$  

**Step 3: Total work done by friction**  
- Sum the work from both segments:  
$$W_{\text{total}} = W_1 + W_2 = -\mu_{k1} mg \frac{d}{2} - \mu_{k2} mg \frac{d}{2}$$  
- Factor out common terms:  
$$W_{\text{total}} = -\frac{1}{2} mgd (\mu_{k1} + \mu_{k2})$$

### Answer

$$\boxed{-\frac{1}{2} m g d \left( \mu_{k1} + \mu_{k2} \right)}$$

## Problem 10

**Topic**: rotational kinetic energy and dynamics (2)

**Thumbnail**: A flywheel with moment of inertia $I$ accelerates from rest under constant torque $\tau$; find its kinetic energy after 5 rotations.

### Problem

A flywheel, with moment of inertia $I$ about its axis of rotation, is initially at rest. Starting at time $t=0$, a constant torque $\tau$ is applied to the flywheel. Determine the rotational kinetic energy of the flywheel after it has completed exactly 5 full rotations.  

Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of the given quantities $I$ and $\tau$, and the constant $\pi$. Do not substitute numerical values for any constants.  

**Final Answer Format Instructions:**  
- Your answer must be a single analytic expression.  
- Use the symbol $\pi$ for pi.  
- Use standard mathematical notation: multiplication must be denoted explicitly (e.g., $a \cdot b$ or $ab$), and fractions must be written using \frac{}{}.  
- The expression must be boxed using $\boxed{}$.

### Solution

The rotational kinetic energy $K$ of a flywheel is given by:  
$$ K = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 $$  
where $\omega$ is the angular velocity at the instant of interest.  

Since a constant torque $\tau$ is applied, the angular acceleration $\alpha$ is constant. The relationship between torque and angular acceleration is:  
$$ \tau = I \alpha \implies \alpha = \frac{\tau}{I} $$  

The flywheel starts from rest, so the initial angular velocity $\omega_0 = 0$. After 5 full rotations, the angular displacement $\theta$ is:  
$$ \theta = 5 \times 2\pi = 10\pi \text{ radians} $$  

Using the kinematic equation for constant angular acceleration:  
$$ \omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2 \alpha \theta $$  
Substitute $\omega_0 = 0$, $\alpha = \tau / I$, and $\theta = 10\pi$:  
$$ \omega^2 = 0 + 2 \left( \frac{\tau}{I} \right) (10\pi) = \frac{20\pi \tau}{I} $$  

Now substitute $\omega^2$ into the kinetic energy equation:  
$$ K = \frac{1}{2} I \left( \frac{20\pi \tau}{I} \right) $$  
Simplify the expression. The $I$ cancels:  
$$ K = \frac{1}{2} \times 20\pi \tau = 10\pi \tau $$  

Thus, the rotational kinetic energy after 5 rotations is $10\pi \tau$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{10\pi\tau}$$

## Problem 11

**Topic**: wave interference and superposition (2)

**Thumbnail**: Find the angular position of the first minimum for a single slit of width 0.1 mm illuminated by 650 nm light.

### Problem

In a laboratory experiment, monochromatic light of wavelength $ \lambda $ illuminates a single slit of width $ a $. Derive an expression for the angular position $ \theta $ (in radians) of the first minimum in the diffraction pattern relative to the central maximum. Express your answer in terms of $ \lambda $ and $ a $. Use the standard notation `\arcsin` for the inverse sine function. Assume the angle $ \theta $ is measured from the central axis of the slit.

**Answer Format Requirements:**  
- Your final answer must be a single analytic expression enclosed in `\boxed{}`.  
- Use `\arcsin` for the inverse sine function.  
- Angles are in radians.  
- Do not include the degree symbol or any units in the final expression.

### Solution

The condition for destructive interference (minimum) in a single-slit diffraction pattern is derived from the path difference between waves from opposite edges of the slit. For the first minimum, the path difference must be equal to one wavelength. This leads to the equation:  

$$ a \sin \theta = \lambda $$  

where:  
- $ a $ is the slit width,  
- $ \theta $ is the angular position of the minimum,  
- $ \lambda $ is the wavelength of the light.  

Solving for $ \theta $:  

$$ \sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{a} $$  

Applying the inverse sine function to both sides:  

$$ \theta = \arcsin\left( \frac{\lambda}{a} \right) $$  

This expression gives the angular position of the first minimum in radians.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\arcsin\left( \frac{\lambda}{a} \right)}$$

## Problem 12

**Topic**: specific heat capacity and calorimetry problems (1)

**Thumbnail**: Determine the specific heat capacity of an unknown metal if a 150 g sample heated to 95¬∞C raises 300 g water from 22¬∞C to 28¬∞C in a calorimeter.

### Problem

A calorimeter of heat capacity $C$ contains water of mass $m_w$ at an initial temperature $T_{wi}$. A sample of an unknown metal with mass $m_m$, initially at temperature $T_{mi}$, is placed into the calorimeter. The system reaches thermal equilibrium at temperature $T_f$. The specific heat capacity of water is $c_w$. Assuming no heat exchange with the surroundings, derive an expression for the specific heat capacity of the metal, $c_m$, in terms of $m_m$, $m_w$, $C$, $T_{mi}$, $T_{wi}$, $T_f$, and $c_w$.

### Solution

By conservation of energy, the heat lost by the metal equals the total heat gained by the water and the calorimeter. The heat lost by the metal is given by:  
$$ Q_{\text{metal}} = m_m c_m (T_{mi} - T_f) $$  

The heat gained by the water is:  
$$ Q_{\text{water}} = m_w c_w (T_f - T_{wi}) $$  

The heat gained by the calorimeter (which has heat capacity $C$) is:  
$$ Q_{\text{cal}} = C (T_f - T_{wi}) $$  

Setting the heat lost equal to the total heat gained:  
$$ m_m c_m (T_{mi} - T_f) = m_w c_w (T_f - T_{wi}) + C (T_f - T_{wi}) $$  

Factor the right-hand side:  
$$ m_m c_m (T_{mi} - T_f) = (T_f - T_{wi}) (m_w c_w + C) $$  

Solve for $c_m$ by dividing both sides by $m_m (T_{mi} - T_f)$:  
$$ c_m = \frac{(T_f - T_{wi}) (m_w c_w + C)}{m_m (T_{mi} - T_f)} $$

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{(T_f - T_{wi}) (m_w  c_w + C)}{m_m (T_{mi} - T_f)}}$$

## Problem 13

**Topic**: average and instantaneous acceleration determination (2)

**Thumbnail**: Given velocity v(t) = 3t¬≤ - 4t + 2 (m/s), find the average acceleration between t=1s and t=3s.

### Problem

In a physics experiment, a remote-controlled car moves along a straight test track. The car's velocity as a function of time is determined to be:  
$$v(t) = a t^{2} + b t + c$$  
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants (with units m/s¬≥, m/s¬≤, and m/s respectively), and $t$ is time in seconds.  

Derive a general expression for the average acceleration of the car over the time interval from $t = t_1$ to $t = t_2$. Express your final answer symbolically in terms of the given parameters $a$, $b$, $t_1$, and $t_2$.

### Solution

The average acceleration over a time interval $[t_1, t_2]$ is defined as the change in velocity divided by the change in time:  
$$a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v(t_2) - v(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1}$$  

Substitute the given velocity function $v(t) = a t^{2} + b t + c$:  
$$v(t_2) = a t_2^{2} + b t_2 + c$$  
$$v(t_1) = a t_1^{2} + b t_1 + c$$  

Compute the change in velocity:  
$$\Delta v = v(t_2) - v(t_1) = (a t_2^{2} + b t_2 + c) - (a t_1^{2} + b t_1 + c)$$  
Simplify by distributing the negative sign and combining like terms:  
$$\Delta v = a t_2^{2} + b t_2 + c - a t_1^{2} - b t_1 - c$$  
$$\Delta v = a (t_2^{2} - t_1^{2}) + b (t_2 - t_1)$$  

Factor the difference of squares $t_2^{2} - t_1^{2} = (t_2 - t_1)(t_2 + t_1)$:  
$$\Delta v = a (t_2 - t_1)(t_2 + t_1) + b (t_2 - t_1)$$  
Factor out $(t_2 - t_1)$:  
$$\Delta v = (t_2 - t_1) \left[ a (t_2 + t_1) + b \right]$$  

Substitute into the average acceleration formula:  
$$a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{(t_2 - t_1) \left[ a (t_2 + t_1) + b \right]}{t_2 - t_1}$$  

Cancel the common factor $(t_2 - t_1)$ (assuming $t_2 \neq t_1$):  
$$a_{\text{avg}} = a (t_2 + t_1) + b$$  

Thus, the average acceleration is expressed solely in terms of $a$, $b$, $t_1$, and $t_2$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{a(t_{2} + t_{1}) + b}$$

## Problem 14

**Topic**: ballistic pendulum analysis (3)

**Thumbnail**: A 20 g bullet strikes a stationary 4 kg ballistic pendulum, causing it to swing with an initial angular velocity of 0.4 rad/s; find the bullet's original speed.

### Problem

A bullet of mass $ m_b $ is fired horizontally at a stationary ballistic pendulum of mass $ m_p $. The pendulum is suspended by a massless rigid rod of length $ L $ that rotates freely about a fixed pivot. The bullet embeds completely into the pendulum block at the end of the rod, which is at a distance $ L $ from the pivot. Immediately after the collision, the pendulum-block system rotates with an initial angular velocity $ \omega $. Derive an expression for the initial speed $ v_b $ of the bullet. 

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $ m_b $, $ m_p $, $ \omega $, and $ L $.

### Solution

The collision between the bullet and the pendulum is inelastic, and the bullet embeds into the pendulum. Since there are no external horizontal forces acting on the system during the collision, linear momentum is conserved in the horizontal direction. Let $ v $ be the linear speed of the combined mass (bullet and pendulum) immediately after the collision. The conservation of momentum equation is:


$$
m_b v_b = (m_b + m_p) v
$$


After the collision, the system rotates about the pivot with an initial angular velocity $ \omega $. The linear speed $ v $ of the combined mass at the end of the rod (distance $ L $ from the pivot) is related to the angular velocity by:


$$
v = \omega L
$$


Substitute this expression for $ v $ into the momentum conservation equation:


$$
m_b v_b = (m_b + m_p) (\omega L)
$$


Solve for $ v_b $:


$$
v_b = \frac{(m_b + m_p) \omega L}{m_b}
$$


This is the expression for the initial speed of the bullet.

### Answer

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{(m_b + m_p) \omega L}{m_b}}
\]

## Problem 15

**Topic**: average and instantaneous acceleration determination (0)

**Thumbnail**: A car accelerates uniformly from rest to 20 m/s in 5 seconds; find the average acceleration.

### Problem

A car starts from rest and moves along a straight road. The car's acceleration increases linearly with time according to $a(t) = k  t$, where $k$ is a constant. After a time $T$, the car has traveled a distance $D$. Determine the average acceleration of the car over the time interval from $t=0$ to $t=T$.

Express your answer in terms of $D$ and $T$ only.

### Solution

The average acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided by the time interval:  
$$ a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v(T) - v(0)}{T - 0} $$  
Since the car starts from rest, $v(0) = 0$. Thus:  
$$ a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{v(T)}{T} $$  

To find $v(T)$, integrate the acceleration function. Acceleration is the derivative of velocity:  
$$ a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = k t $$  
Separate variables and integrate from $t=0$ to $t$:  
$$ \int_{0}^{v(t)} dv = \int_{0}^{t} k t'  dt' $$  
$$ v(t) - 0 = k \left[ \frac{(t')^{2}}{2} \right]_{0}^{t} $$  
$$ v(t) = \frac{1}{2} k t^{2} $$  
At $t = T$:  
$$ v(T) = \frac{1}{2} k T^{2} $$  
Substitute into the average acceleration formula:  
$$ a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} k T^{2}}{T} = \frac{1}{2} k T $$  

Now eliminate $k$ using the distance $D$. Velocity is the derivative of displacement:  
$$ v(t) = \frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} k t^{2} $$  
Integrate from $t=0$ to $t=T$ with $s(0)=0$ and $s(T)=D$:  
$$ \int_{0}^{D} ds = \int_{0}^{T} \frac{1}{2} k t^{2}  dt $$  
$$ D = \frac{1}{2} k \left[ \frac{t^{3}}{3} \right]_{0}^{T} = \frac{1}{2} k \cdot \frac{T^{3}}{3} = \frac{1}{6} k T^{3} $$  
Solve for $k$:  
$$ k = \frac{6D}{T^{3}} $$  

Substitute $k$ into the average acceleration expression:  
$$ a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{6D}{T^{3}} \right) T = \frac{6D}{2 T^{2}} = \frac{3D}{T^{2}} $$

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{3D}{T^{2}}}$$

## Problem 16

**Topic**: work done by expanding gases (1)

**Thumbnail**: An ideal gas undergoes adiabatic expansion with Œ≥=1.4 from 400 K to 300 K at initial volume 0.2 m¬≥; find work done.

### Problem

An ideal gas with adiabatic index $\gamma$ undergoes an adiabatic expansion. The gas starts at an initial volume $V_1$ and initial temperature $T_1$, and expands until its temperature is $T_2$. The gas consists of $n$ moles. Find the work done by the gas.

Express your answer in terms of $n$, $R$ (the universal gas constant), $\gamma$, $T_1$, and $T_2$.

### Solution

The work done by an ideal gas during an adiabatic expansion is given by:  
$$ W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} P  dV $$  
For an adiabatic process, $PV^\gamma = \text{constant}$. Using the initial state:  
$$ P_1 V_1^\gamma = P V^\gamma \implies P = P_1 V_1^\gamma V^{-\gamma} $$  
Substitute into the work integral:  
$$ W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_1 V_1^\gamma V^{-\gamma}  dV = P_1 V_1^\gamma \int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^{-\gamma}  dV $$  
The integral evaluates to:  
$$ \int V^{-\gamma}  dV = \frac{V^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} $$  
Thus:  
$$ W = P_1 V_1^\gamma \left[ \frac{V^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} \right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = \frac{P_1 V_1^\gamma}{1-\gamma} \left( V_2^{1-\gamma} - V_1^{1-\gamma} \right) $$  
Factor $V_1^{1-\gamma}$:  
$$ W = \frac{P_1 V_1^\gamma}{1-\gamma} V_1^{1-\gamma} \left( \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \right) = \frac{P_1 V_1}{1-\gamma} \left( \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \right) $$  
For adiabatic processes, $TV^{\gamma-1} = \text{constant}$:  
$$ T_1 V_1^{\gamma-1} = T_2 V_2^{\gamma-1} \implies \frac{V_2}{V_1} = \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}} $$  
Raise both sides to the power $1-\gamma$:  
$$ \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)^{1-\gamma} = \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^{\frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma-1}} = \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^{-1} = \frac{T_2}{T_1} $$  
Substitute this into the work expression:  
$$ W = \frac{P_1 V_1}{1-\gamma} \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} - 1 \right) = \frac{P_1 V_1}{1-\gamma} \cdot \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1} $$  
Apply the ideal gas law at the initial state: $P_1 V_1 = n R T_1$:  
$$ W = \frac{n R T_1}{1-\gamma} \cdot \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1} = \frac{n R (T_2 - T_1)}{1-\gamma} $$  
Since $1 - \gamma = -(\gamma - 1)$, rewrite as:  
$$ W = \frac{n R (T_2 - T_1)}{-(\gamma - 1)} = \frac{n R (T_1 - T_2)}{\gamma - 1} $$  
Thus, the work done by the gas is $\frac{n R (T_1 - T_2)}{\gamma - 1}$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{n R (T_1 - T_2)}{\gamma - 1}}$$

## Problem 17

**Topic**: magnetic energy storage in inductors (3)

**Thumbnail**: Two inductors (L‚ÇÅ=0.2 H, L‚ÇÇ=0.3 H) are connected in series with 5 A current; calculate the total stored energy.

### Problem

Two inductors with inductances $ L_1 $ and $ L_2 $ are connected in series. A steady current $ I $ flows through the circuit. Derive an expression for the total magnetic energy stored in both inductors. Express your final answer symbolically in terms of $ L_1 $, $ L_2 $, and $ I $.

**Formatting Instructions for Final Answer:**  
- Use standard LaTeX notation for all mathematical expressions.  
- Express fractions using `\frac{numerator}{denominator}` format (e.g., `\frac{1}{2}`).  
- Use explicit multiplication symbols where needed (e.g., $ L_1 I^2 $, not $ L_1I^2 $).  
- Exponents must be written with a caret and curly braces (e.g., $ I^{2} $).

### Solution

The magnetic energy stored in a single inductor with inductance $ L $ carrying current $ I $ is given by the formula:  
$$ U = \frac{1}{2} L I^{2} $$  

For the first inductor with inductance $ L_1 $, the stored energy is:  
$$ U_1 = \frac{1}{2} L_1 I^{2} $$  

For the second inductor with inductance $ L_2 $, the stored energy is:  
$$ U_2 = \frac{1}{2} L_2 I^{2} $$  

Since the inductors are connected in series, the same current $ I $ flows through both. The total energy stored is the sum of the energies in each inductor:  
$$ U_{\text{total}} = U_1 + U_2 = \frac{1}{2} L_1 I^{2} + \frac{1}{2} L_2 I^{2} $$  

Factor out the common terms $ \frac{1}{2} $ and $ I^{2} $:  
$$ U_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} I^{2} (L_1 + L_2) $$

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2} \left( L_1 + L_2 \right) I^{2}}$$

## Problem 18

**Topic**: kinetic energy calculations (0)

**Thumbnail**: Calculate the kinetic energy of a 1200 kg car moving at 25 m/s.

### Problem

A train is moving due east at a constant speed $v_T$ relative to the ground. On the flatbed of this train, a car of mass $m$ is moving due north at a constant speed $v_C$ relative to the train. Derive an expression for the kinetic energy of the car relative to the ground. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $v_T$, and $v_C$.

### Solution

The kinetic energy of an object is given by $KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$, where $v$ is the speed of the object relative to the reference frame. Here, the reference frame is the ground.  

The velocity of the car relative to the ground ($\vec{v}_{CG}$) is the vector sum of the velocity of the car relative to the train ($\vec{v}_{CT}$) and the velocity of the train relative to the ground ($\vec{v}_{TG}$). Since the car moves due north relative to the train and the train moves due east relative to the ground, these velocities are perpendicular. Thus:  

$$
\vec{v}_{CT} = v_C \hat{\jmath} \quad \text{(north direction)}, \qquad \vec{v}_{TG} = v_T \hat{\imath} \quad \text{(east direction)}.
$$
  
The resultant velocity relative to the ground is:  

$$
\vec{v}_{CG} = v_T \hat{\imath} + v_C \hat{\jmath}.
$$
  
The magnitude of this velocity is:  

$$
|\vec{v}_{CG}| = \sqrt{v_T^2 + v_C^2}.
$$
  
Substitute this speed into the kinetic energy formula:  

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} m \left( \sqrt{v_T^2 + v_C^2} \right)^2.
$$
  
Simplify the expression:  

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} m (v_T^2 + v_C^2).
$$
  
Thus, the kinetic energy of the car relative to the ground is $\frac{1}{2} m (v_T^2 + v_C^2)$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\frac{1}{2} m \left( v_{T}^{2} + v_{C}^{2} \right)}$$

## Problem 19

**Topic**: Young double-slit interference pattern (1)

**Thumbnail**: Determine the path difference for the third dark fringe when monochromatic light of wavelength 500 nm passes through slits 0.2 mm apart.

### Problem

In a Young's double-slit experiment, monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ is incident on two narrow slits separated by a distance $d$. The interference pattern is observed on a distant screen. Determine the path difference $\delta$ for the third dark fringe from the central maximum. Express your answer solely in terms of $\lambda$.

### Solution

The condition for destructive interference (dark fringes) in Young's double-slit experiment is given by the path difference $\delta$ satisfying:  
$$\delta = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right) \lambda, \quad \text{where} \quad m = 0, 1, 2, \dots$$  
Here, $m$ denotes the order of the dark fringe.  

The central bright fringe ($m=0$ for bright fringes) is flanked by dark fringes symmetrically. The indexing is as follows:  
- The first dark fringe corresponds to $m=0$  
- The second dark fringe corresponds to $m=1$  
- The third dark fringe corresponds to $m=2$  

Substituting $m=2$ into the condition for destructive interference:  
$$\delta = \left(2 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \lambda = \frac{5}{2} \lambda$$  

Thus, the path difference for the third dark fringe is $\frac{5}{2} \lambda$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{5\lambda}{2}}$$

## Problem 20

**Topic**: phase changes and latent heat calculations (3)

**Thumbnail**: Compute the time required for a 1.5 kW heater to melt 4 kg of ice at 0¬∞C initially, given latent heat of fusion.

### Problem

A portable electric heater with power output $P$ is used to melt a block of ice initially at $0^\circ$C. The ice has mass $m$, and the latent heat of fusion for ice is $L_f$. 

Derive an expression for the time $t$ required to completely melt the ice. 

Express your answer solely in terms of the given symbols $P$, $m$, and $L_f$.

### Solution

The energy $Q$ required to melt the ice is determined by the phase change from solid to liquid. Since the ice is already at the melting point ($0^\circ$C), no temperature change occurs, and the energy is given by the product of the mass and the latent heat of fusion:  
$$ Q = m L_f $$  

The heater supplies energy at a constant rate equal to its power $P$. The relationship between energy supplied, power, and time is:  
$$ Q = P t $$  

Substituting the expression for $Q$:  
$$ m L_f = P t $$  

Solving for the time $t$:  
$$ t = \frac{m L_f}{P} $$

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{mL_{f}}{P}}$$

## Problem 21

**Topic**: dimensional analysis in problem solving (3)

**Thumbnail**: If pressure $P$ is related to density $\rho$ and velocity $v$ as $P = k\rho^a v^b$, find exponents $a$ and $b$ that make the equation dimensionally consistent.

### Problem

In fluid dynamics, pressure $P$ is defined as force per unit area, density $\rho$ as mass per unit volume, and velocity $v$ as distance per unit time. The fundamental dimensions are mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$). 

Given the equation $P = k \rho^a v^b$, where $k$ is a dimensionless constant, find the exponents $a$ and $b$ that make this equation dimensionally consistent. 

Express your answer as the values of $a$ and $b$ in the form $a = \ldots$ and $b = \ldots$.

### Solution

To ensure dimensional consistency, the dimensions of both sides of the equation $P = k \rho^a v^b$ must be equal. Since $k$ is dimensionless, it does not contribute to the dimensions. Therefore, we equate the dimensions of $P$ to the dimensions of $\rho^a v^b$.

The dimensions of the quantities are:
- Pressure $P$: Force per unit area. Force has dimensions $[M L T^{-2}]$, and area has dimensions $[L^2]$, so $[P] = [M L^{-1} T^{-2}]$.
- Density $\rho$: Mass per unit volume, so $[\rho] = [M L^{-3}]$.
- Velocity $v$: Distance per time, so $[v] = [L T^{-1}]$.

The dimensional equation is:
$$ [M L^{-1} T^{-2}] = [M L^{-3}]^a [L T^{-1}]^b $$

Expanding the right-hand side:
$$ [M]^a [L^{-3}]^a [L]^b [T^{-1}]^b = [M]^a [L]^{-3a + b} [T]^{-b} $$

Equating the exponents for each fundamental dimension:

- For mass ($M$): $1 = a$
- For length ($L$): $-1 = -3a + b$
- For time ($T$): $-2 = -b$

We now solve the system of equations.

From the mass equation: $a = 1$.

From the time equation: $-2 = -b$ gives $b = 2$.

Substitute $a=1$ into the length equation: $-1 = -3(1) + b$ gives $-1 = -3 + b$, so $b = 2$. This is consistent.

Therefore, the exponents are $a=1$ and $b=2$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{a=1,\ b=2}$$

## Problem 22

**Topic**: geosynchronous orbit characteristics (2)

**Thumbnail**: Find the centripetal acceleration of a geosynchronous satellite if the gravitational acceleration at that orbit is g/36, where g is Earth's surface gravity.

### Problem

A geosynchronous satellite orbits Earth in a circular path. The gravitational acceleration due to Earth at the satellite's orbital distance is measured to be $ \frac{g}{36} $, where $ g $ is the gravitational acceleration at Earth's surface. Determine the satellite's centripetal acceleration.

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $ g $.

### Solution

The gravitational force provides the centripetal force for a satellite in circular orbit. For a satellite of mass $ m $, the gravitational force is:  

$$ F_g = \frac{G M m}{r^2} $$
  
where $ M $ is Earth's mass, $ r $ is the orbital radius, and $ G $ is the gravitational constant. This equals the centripetal force:  

$$ F_c = m a_c $$
  
where $ a_c $ is the centripetal acceleration. Setting these equal:  

$$ \frac{G M m}{r^2} = m a_c $$
  
Dividing both sides by $ m $ (assuming $ m \neq 0 $):  

$$ \frac{G M}{r^2} = a_c $$
  
The term $ \frac{G M}{r^2} $ is the gravitational acceleration at distance $ r $, denoted as $ g_{\text{orbit}} $. Thus:  

$$ a_c = g_{\text{orbit}} $$
  
The problem states that $ g_{\text{orbit}} = \frac{g}{36} $. Substituting this value:  

$$ a_c = \frac{g}{36} $$
  
Therefore, the centripetal acceleration equals the given gravitational acceleration at the orbital distance.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{g}{36}}$$

## Problem 23

**Topic**: magnetic field of long straight wires (1)

**Thumbnail**: Determine the distance where the magnetic field is 40 ŒºT for a wire with 12 A current.

### Problem

In a laboratory, a long straight wire is aligned horizontally. It carries a steady current $I$. A scientist measures the magnitude of the magnetic field at a point near the wire and obtains a reading of $B$. The scientist knows that the magnetic field is due to the current in the wire and that the field strength depends on the distance from the wire. However, the exact relationship is not immediately known. Starting from the fundamental law for the magnetic field produced by a steady current, derive an expression for the perpendicular distance $r$ from the wire to the measurement point. Express $r$ in terms of $I$, $B$, and the permeability of free space $\mu_0$.

Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $I$, $B$, and $\mu_0$.

### Solution

To derive the expression for the distance $r$, we begin with Amp√®re's circuital law, which relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the current passing through the loop. The law states:  
$$ \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I_{\text{enclosed}} $$

Consider a circular path of radius $r$ centered on the wire and lying in a plane perpendicular to it. Due to the symmetry of the straight wire, the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is everywhere tangent to this circular path and has constant magnitude $B$ along the path. The direction of $\vec{B}$ is azimuthal (following the right-hand rule relative to the current direction).  

The line integral of $\vec{B}$ along this circular path simplifies to:  
$$ \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = B \oint dl = B \cdot (2\pi r) $$  
since the path length is the circumference $2\pi r$ and $\vec{B}$ is parallel to $d\vec{l}$.  

The current enclosed by this loop is the entire current $I$ in the wire. Applying Amp√®re's law:  
$$ B \cdot 2\pi r = \mu_0 I $$  

Solving for $r$:  
$$ r = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi B} $$  

This gives the perpendicular distance $r$ from the wire to the point where the magnetic field magnitude is $B$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{\mu_{0} I}{2\pi B}}$$

## Problem 24

**Topic**: magnetic field at center of current loops (5)

**Thumbnail**: A circular arc of radius 0.8 m and central angle 120 degrees carries a current of 3 A; calculate the magnetic field at its center of curvature.

### Problem

A circular wire segment (arc) of radius $R$ subtends a central angle $\phi$ (in degrees) and carries a steady current $I$. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of curvature. Express your final answer symbolically in terms of $\mu_0$ (the permeability of free space), $I$, $R$, and $\phi$. 

Ensure your derivation starts from fundamental principles and clearly shows all steps. Do not assume or use any pre-derived formulas for the magnetic field of an arc.

### Solution

The magnetic field due to a current-carrying wire can be found using the Biot-Savart law:
$$ d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{I  d\vec{l} \times \hat{r}}{r^2} $$
where $d\vec{l}$ is an infinitesimal length element of the wire, $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector from the length element to the point of interest, and $r$ is the distance between them.

For the circular arc centered at point $O$, every point on the arc is at a distance $r = R$ from $O$. The vector $\hat{r}$ points radially inward toward $O$, and $d\vec{l}$ is tangential to the arc. The angle between $d\vec{l}$ and $\hat{r}$ is $90^\circ$, so:
$$ |d\vec{l} \times \hat{r}| = dl \cdot \sin(90^\circ) = dl $$
The magnitude of the magnetic field contribution from $d\vec{l}$ is:
$$ dB = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{I  dl}{R^2} $$
The direction of $d\vec{B}$ is perpendicular to the plane of the arc, and by symmetry, all contributions add along the same axis. Thus, the total field magnitude is the integral of $dB$ over the arc.

Parameterize the arc using the central angle $\theta$ (in radians), measured from a reference radius. The arc length element is $dl = R  d\theta$. The total central angle in radians is $\alpha = \phi \cdot \frac{\pi}{180}$, since $\phi$ is given in degrees. Integrating from $\theta = 0$ to $\theta = \alpha$:
$$ B = \int dB = \int_0^\alpha \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi R^2}  R  d\theta = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi R} \int_0^\alpha d\theta = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi R} \alpha $$
Substitute $\alpha = \phi \cdot \frac{\pi}{180}$:
$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi R} \left( \phi \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \right) = \frac{\mu_0 I \phi \pi}{4\pi R \cdot 180} = \frac{\mu_0 I \phi}{720 R} $$
Thus, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of curvature is $\frac{\mu_0 I \phi}{720 R}$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{\mu_{0} I \phi}{720 R}}$$

## Problem 25

**Topic**: order of magnitude estimations (3)

**Thumbnail**: Estimate the number of water molecules in a raindrop.

### Problem

A typical raindrop is approximately spherical with a diameter of 2 millimeters. The density of water is 1 gram per cubic centimeter. Water has a molar mass of 18 grams per mole, and Avogadro's number is $ 6.022 \times 10^{23} $ molecules per mole.  

Estimate the number of water molecules in the raindrop. Express your answer as a power of 10 and round the exponent to the nearest integer.

### Solution

### Step 1: Convert units for consistency  
- Diameter $ d = 2 \, \text{mm} = 0.2 \, \text{cm} $ (since 1 cm = 10 mm).  
- Density $ \rho = 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 $.  
- Molar mass $ M = 18 \, \text{g/mol} $.  
- Avogadro's number $ N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} $.  

### Step 2: Calculate the volume of the raindrop  
The volume of a sphere is given by:  
$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 $$  
where the radius $ r = \frac{d}{2} = 0.1 \, \text{cm} $.  
Substitute the radius:  
$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (0.1)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (0.001) = \frac{4\pi}{3000} \, \text{cm}^3 $$  
Using $ \pi \approx 3.1416 $:  
$$ V \approx \frac{4 \times 3.1416}{3000} = \frac{12.5664}{3000} \approx 0.0041888 \, \text{cm}^3 $$  

### Step 3: Calculate the mass of the raindrop  
Mass is density multiplied by volume:  
$$ m = \rho V = 1 \times 0.0041888 = 0.0041888 \, \text{g} $$  

### Step 4: Calculate the number of moles  
Number of moles $ n $ is mass divided by molar mass:  
$$ n = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{0.0041888}{18} \approx 0.00023271 \, \text{mol} $$  

### Step 5: Calculate the number of water molecules  
Number of molecules $ N $ is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number:  
$$ N = n \times N_A = 0.00023271 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} $$  
Compute the product:  
$$ N \approx 1.401 \times 10^{20} $$  

### Step 6: Express as a power of 10 and round the exponent  
The result is $ 1.401 \times 10^{20} $. To express as a power of 10:  
$$ N = 10^{\log_{10}(1.401 \times 10^{20})} = 10^{20 + \log_{10}(1.401)} \approx 10^{20.146} $$  
The exponent is 20.146. Rounding to the nearest integer:  
$$ 20.146 \approx 20 $$  
Thus, the order of magnitude is $ 10^{20} $.

### Answer

$$\boxed{10^{20}}$$

## Problem 26

**Topic**: friction force direction determination (1)

**Thumbnail**: Calculate the direction and magnitude of friction force acting on a 5 kg block pushed with 30 N force on a horizontal surface if it remains stationary.

### Problem

A block of mass $m$ is placed on an inclined plane with an angle of inclination $\alpha$. A horizontal force of magnitude $F$ is applied to the block, acting toward the plane (i.e., in the direction that would push the block up the incline if there were no friction). The block remains stationary. Find the friction force $f$ acting on the block, using the sign convention that a positive $f$ means the force is directed up the incline, and a negative $f$ means down the incline. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $g$, $\alpha$, and $F$.

### Solution

To determine the friction force, we analyze the forces acting on the block. We use a coordinate system where the x-axis is parallel to the incline (positive direction up the incline) and the y-axis is perpendicular to the incline (positive direction outward from the incline).

**Forces in the y-direction (perpendicular to the incline):**  
- Normal force $N$ acts outward (positive y-direction).  
- Component of gravity: $mg \cos \alpha$ acts into the incline (negative y-direction).  
- Component of applied force $F$: Since $F$ is horizontal, its y-component is $F \sin \alpha$ (into the incline, negative y-direction).  
The net force in the y-direction is zero (no acceleration perpendicular to the incline):  
$$ N - mg \cos \alpha - F \sin \alpha = 0 $$  
Solving for $N$:  
$$ N = mg \cos \alpha + F \sin \alpha $$  

**Forces in the x-direction (parallel to the incline):**  
- Component of gravity: $mg \sin \alpha$ acts down the incline (negative x-direction).  
- Component of applied force $F$: $F \cos \alpha$ acts up the incline (positive x-direction).  
- Friction force $f$: Direction depends on the net effect of other forces. By the sign convention, $f > 0$ if directed up the incline (positive x), $f < 0$ if down.  
The net force in the x-direction is zero (block is stationary):  
$$ F \cos \alpha + f - mg \sin \alpha = 0 $$  
Solving for $f$:  
$$ f = mg \sin \alpha - F \cos \alpha $$  

**Interpretation:**  
- If $mg \sin \alpha > F \cos \alpha$, then $f > 0$: Friction acts up the incline.  
- If $mg \sin \alpha < F \cos \alpha$, then $f < 0$: Friction acts down the incline.  
- If $mg \sin \alpha = F \cos \alpha$, then $f = 0$: No friction needed.  

The expression $f = mg \sin \alpha - F \cos \alpha$ gives the magnitude and direction (via sign) of the friction force.

### Answer

$$\boxed{mg \sin \alpha - F \cos \alpha}$$

## Problem 27

**Topic**: optical instrument magnification (1)

**Thumbnail**: A compound microscope has an objective lens with focal length 4 mm and an eyepiece with focal length 25 mm; find the total magnification when the object is placed 4.1 mm from the objective and the final image is at infinity.

### Problem

A compound microscope consists of an objective lens with focal length $ f_o $ and an eyepiece with focal length $ f_e $. The object is placed at a distance $ d_o $ from the objective lens. The final image is formed at infinity, and the least distance of distinct vision is $ D $. 

Derive an expression for the total magnification $ M $ of the microscope. Express your answer in terms of $ f_o $, $ f_e $, $ d_o $, and $ D $.

**Answer Format Instructions**  
- Your final answer must be an analytic expression enclosed in \boxed{} using only the variables $ f_o $, $ f_e $, $ d_o $, and $ D $.  
- Use standard mathematical notation: fractions as \frac{numerator}{denominator}, and multiplication explicitly shown.  
- Do not evaluate any constants numerically.  
- Do not include units in the expression.

### Solution

**Step 1: Determine the image distance for the objective lens**  
The lens formula for the objective is:  
$$ \frac{1}{f_o} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} $$  
where $ d_i $ is the image distance from the objective. Solving for $ d_i $:  
$$ \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f_o} - \frac{1}{d_o} = \frac{d_o - f_o}{f_o d_o} $$  
$$ d_i = \frac{f_o d_o}{d_o - f_o} $$  

**Step 2: Calculate the magnification of the objective lens ($ m_o $)**  
The lateral magnification for the objective is:  
$$ m_o = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} $$  
Substitute $ d_i $:  
$$ m_o = -\frac{ \frac{f_o d_o}{d_o - f_o} }{ d_o } = -\frac{f_o}{d_o - f_o} $$  

**Step 3: Calculate the magnification of the eyepiece ($ m_e $)**  
Since the final image is at infinity, the intermediate image (formed by the objective) must lie at the focal point of the eyepiece. The angular magnification of the eyepiece (acting as a simple magnifier) for an image at infinity is:  
$$ m_e = \frac{D}{f_e} $$  
where $ D $ is the least distance of distinct vision.  

**Step 4: Compute the total magnification ($ M $)**  
The total magnification is the product of the magnifications of the objective and eyepiece:  
$$ M = m_o \times m_e = \left( -\frac{f_o}{d_o - f_o} \right) \times \left( \frac{D}{f_e} \right) $$  
Simplify the expression:  
$$ M = -\frac{f_o D}{f_e (d_o - f_o)} $$

### Answer

$$\boxed{ -\dfrac{ f_o D }{ f_e \left( d_o - f_o \right) } }$$

## Problem 28

**Topic**: displacement and distance from path data (2)

**Thumbnail**: A hiker walks 3 km at 30¬∞ north of east, then 4 km due south; determine the displacement vector's magnitude.

### Problem

A robotic vacuum cleaner starts at the origin of a coordinate system and cleans in two segments. First, it travels a distance $ d_1 $ at an angle $ \theta $ north of east. It then changes direction and travels due south a distance $ d_2 $. Determine the magnitude of the vacuum cleaner's total displacement from the origin.

Express your answer symbolically in terms of $ d_1 $, $ d_2 $, and $ \theta $. Use standard mathematical notation:  
- Write trigonometric functions as $\sin(\theta)$, $\cos(\theta)$, etc.  
- The angle $\theta$ is given in degrees, but do not include the degree symbol in trigonometric functions.  
- Use $\sqrt{\ }$ for square roots.  
- Do not simplify numerical constants or substitute any values.

### Solution

**Step 1: Establish coordinate system**  
Set east as the positive $x$-direction and north as the positive $y$-direction. The origin is the starting point.

**Step 2: Resolve first displacement into components**  
The first displacement has magnitude $d_1$ at angle $\theta$ north of east.  
- $x$-component: $ d_{1x} = d_1 \cos(\theta) $  
- $y$-component: $ d_{1y} = d_1 \sin(\theta) $  

**Step 3: Resolve second displacement into components**  
The second displacement is due south (negative $y$-direction) with magnitude $d_2$.  
- $x$-component: $ d_{2x} = 0 $  
- $y$-component: $ d_{2y} = -d_2 $  

**Step 4: Compute total displacement components**  
- Total $x$-displacement: $ x_{\text{total}} = d_{1x} + d_{2x} = d_1 \cos(\theta) + 0 = d_1 \cos(\theta) $  
- Total $y$-displacement: $ y_{\text{total}} = d_{1y} + d_{2y} = d_1 \sin(\theta) - d_2 $  

**Step 5: Apply magnitude formula**  
The magnitude of displacement is:  

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{ (x_{\text{total}})^2 + (y_{\text{total}})^2 }
$$
  
Substitute the components:  

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{ \left( d_1 \cos(\theta) \right)^2 + \left( d_1 \sin(\theta) - d_2 \right)^2 }
$$
  

**Step 6: Expand and simplify**  
Expand the squares:  

$$
\left( d_1 \cos(\theta) \right)^2 = d_1^2 \cos^2(\theta)
$$
  

$$
\left( d_1 \sin(\theta) - d_2 \right)^2 = d_1^2 \sin^2(\theta) - 2 d_1 d_2 \sin(\theta) + d_2^2
$$
  
Combine all terms:  

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{ d_1^2 \cos^2(\theta) + d_1^2 \sin^2(\theta) - 2 d_1 d_2 \sin(\theta) + d_2^2 }
$$
  
Group like terms:  

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{ d_1^2 \left( \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) \right) + d_2^2 - 2 d_1 d_2 \sin(\theta) }
$$
  
Apply Pythagorean identity $\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1$:  

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{ d_1^2 (1) + d_2^2 - 2 d_1 d_2 \sin(\theta) }
$$
  
Final simplified expression:  

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{ d_1^2 + d_2^2 - 2 d_1 d_2 \sin(\theta) }
$$

### Answer

\[
\boxed{\sqrt{d_1^{2} + d_2^{2} - 2 d_1 d_2 \sin(\theta)}}
\]

## Problem 29

**Topic**: maximum speed and acceleration in simple harmonic motion (2)

**Thumbnail**: An object in SHM has maximum acceleration 12 m/s¬≤ when its displacement is 0.04 m; find its maximum speed.

### Problem

In a laboratory experiment, a sensitive accelerometer is mounted on a platform that oscillates vertically with simple harmonic motion. The platform's motion is characterized by an amplitude $A$, which is the maximum distance from its equilibrium position. During the oscillation, the accelerometer records a maximum acceleration magnitude of $a_{\text{max}}$. Derive an expression for the maximum speed $v_{\text{max}}$ attained by the platform during its motion. Express your final answer solely in terms of $a_{\text{max}}$ and $A$.

### Solution

In simple harmonic motion (SHM), the acceleration $a$ and displacement $x$ from equilibrium are related by:

$$
a = -\omega^2 x
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency. The maximum acceleration occurs when the displacement is maximum, which is the amplitude $A$. Thus:

$$
|a|_{\text{max}} = \omega^2 A
$$

Given that $|a|_{\text{max}} = a_{\text{max}}$, this becomes:

$$
a_{\text{max}} = \omega^2 A \quad (1)
$$


The velocity $v$ in SHM is given by:

$$
v = \pm \omega \sqrt{A^2 - x^2}
$$

The maximum speed occurs when $x = 0$ (equilibrium position):

$$
v_{\text{max}} = \omega A \quad (2)
$$


Solving equation (1) for $\omega$:

$$
\omega^2 = \frac{a_{\text{max}}}{A} \implies \omega = \sqrt{\frac{a_{\text{max}}}{A}}
$$

Substitute this expression for $\omega$ into equation (2):

$$
v_{\text{max}} = \left( \sqrt{\frac{a_{\text{max}}}{A}} \right) A = \sqrt{\frac{a_{\text{max}}}{A}} \cdot A
$$

Simplify the expression:

$$
v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{a_{\text{max}} \cdot A}
$$


Thus, the maximum speed is $\sqrt{a_{\text{max}} \cdot A}$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\sqrt{a_{\text{max}} \cdot A}}$$

## Problem 30

**Topic**: activity of radioactive samples (3)

**Thumbnail**: An ancient bone fragment has 25% of the carbon-14 activity of living tissue; given carbon-14's half-life is 5730 years, calculate its age.

### Problem

In carbon-14 dating, the activity of carbon-14 in a sample is compared to that in living tissue. An ancient bone fragment has a current carbon-14 activity that is a fraction $ f $ of the activity in living tissue. The half-life of carbon-14 is $ T_{1/2} $.  

Derive an expression for the age $ t $ of the bone fragment in terms of $ f $ and $ T_{1/2} $.  

* Express your answer using the natural logarithm function, denoted as $ \ln $.  
* The final expression must be simplified and should not include any constants beyond $ f $ and $ T_{1/2} $.  
* Do not substitute any numerical values.

### Solution

The decay of radioactive nuclei follows an exponential law. The activity $ A $ at time $ t $ is given by:  
$$ A = A_0 e^{-\lambda t} $$  
where:  
- $ A_0 $ is the initial activity (activity in living tissue at the time of death),  
- $ \lambda $ is the decay constant,  
- $ t $ is the age of the sample.  

Given that the current activity is a fraction $ f $ of the initial activity:  
$$ A = f A_0 $$  
Substitute into the decay equation:  
$$ f A_0 = A_0 e^{-\lambda t} $$  
Divide both sides by $ A_0 $ (assuming $ A_0 > 0 $):  
$$ f = e^{-\lambda t} $$  
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:  
$$ \ln(f) = \ln(e^{-\lambda t}) = -\lambda t $$  
Solve for $ t $:  
$$ t = -\frac{\ln(f)}{\lambda} \quad (1) $$  

The decay constant $ \lambda $ is related to the half-life $ T_{1/2} $ by the half-life equation:  
$$ \frac{1}{2} A_0 = A_0 e^{-\lambda T_{1/2}} $$  
Divide by $ A_0 $:  
$$ \frac{1}{2} = e^{-\lambda T_{1/2}} $$  
Take the natural logarithm:  
$$ \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\lambda T_{1/2} $$  
Simplify:  
$$ -\ln(2) = -\lambda T_{1/2} $$  
Solve for $ \lambda $:  
$$ \lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} \quad (2) $$  

Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):  
$$ t = -\frac{\ln(f)}{\frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}} = -\ln(f) \cdot \frac{T_{1/2}}{\ln(2)} = \frac{T_{1/2}}{\ln(2)} \cdot \left(-\ln(f)\right) $$  
Simplify the logarithm:  
$$ -\ln(f) = \ln\left(\frac{1}{f}\right) $$  
Thus:  
$$ t = \frac{T_{1/2}}{\ln(2)} \ln\left(\frac{1}{f}\right) $$  
The expression for the age $ t $ is:  
$$ t = \frac{T_{1/2} \ln\left(\frac{1}{f}\right)}{\ln(2)} $$

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{T_{1/2} \ln \left( \dfrac{1}{f} \right)}{\ln(2)}}$$

## Problem 31

**Topic**: weight calculations from mass (0)

**Thumbnail**: Calculate the weight in newtons of a 5 kg object on Earth's surface with g = 9.8 m/s¬≤.

### Problem

A spherical exoplanet of mass $M$ has a radius $R$. A robotic probe lands on its surface and deploys an instrument package of mass $m$. Derive an expression for the weight of the instrument package in newtons. Use the universal gravitational constant $G$ in your derivation.

Express your final answer solely in terms of the given symbolic quantities: $M$, $R$, $m$, and $G$. Do not include any numerical values or approximations.

### Solution

The weight of an object is defined as the gravitational force exerted on it by a celestial body. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the magnitude of the gravitational force $F$ between two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by:  
$$ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$  

In this scenario:  
- $m_1$ is the mass of the exoplanet, $M$  
- $m_2$ is the mass of the instrument package, $m$  
- $r$ is the distance between their centers of mass. Since the instrument package is on the planet's surface, $r = R$  

Substituting these values into the gravitational force equation:  
$$ F = G \frac{M \cdot m}{R^2} $$  

This force $F$ is precisely the weight $W$ of the instrument package. Therefore:  
$$ W = G \frac{M m}{R^2} $$  

No further simplification is required. The expression is complete and matches the required symbolic form.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{G M m}{R^{2}}}$$

## Problem 32

**Topic**: range and maximum height of projectiles (1)

**Thumbnail**: Find the horizontal range of a projectile launched from ground level with initial velocity $v_0$ at angle $\theta$, landing at the same elevation.

### Problem

A projectile is launched from ground level with an initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal. Throughout its flight, the projectile experiences a constant horizontal deceleration $a$ due to wind resistance (opposing the initial horizontal velocity component), in addition to the constant vertical acceleration due to gravity $g$. The projectile lands at ground level. Derive an expression for the horizontal range $R$ of the projectile.

Express your answer in terms of $v_0$, $\theta$, $g$, and $a$ only. Use standard mathematical notation:  
- Trigonometric functions: $\sin$, $\cos$  
- Fractions: $\frac{numerator}{denominator}$  
- Exponents: $x^y$

### Solution

The motion is analyzed in two components: vertical and horizontal. The vertical motion determines the time of flight, while the horizontal motion determines the range.

**Step 1: Vertical motion**  
Initial vertical velocity: $v_{0y} = v_0 \sin\theta$  
Vertical acceleration: $a_y = -g$ (downward)  
Vertical displacement equation:  
$$ y = v_{0y} t + \frac{1}{2} a_y t^2 $$  
At landing, $y = 0$ and $t = T$ (time of flight):  
$$ 0 = (v_0 \sin\theta) T - \frac{1}{2} g T^2 $$  
Solve for $T$:  
$$ T \left( v_0 \sin\theta - \frac{1}{2} g T \right) = 0 $$  
Non-trivial solution:  
$$ T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g} $$  

**Step 2: Horizontal motion**  
Initial horizontal velocity: $v_{0x} = v_0 \cos\theta$  
Horizontal acceleration: $a_x = -a$ (deceleration opposite to motion)  
Horizontal displacement equation:  
$$ x = v_{0x} t + \frac{1}{2} a_x t^2 $$  
At $t = T$, $x = R$:  
$$ R = (v_0 \cos\theta) T + \frac{1}{2} (-a) T^2 $$  
Substitute $T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g}$:  
$$ R = (v_0 \cos\theta) \left( \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g} \right) - \frac{1}{2} a \left( \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g} \right)^2 $$  
Simplify:  
$$ R = \frac{2 v_0^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta}{g} - \frac{1}{2} a \cdot \frac{4 v_0^2 \sin^2\theta}{g^2} $$  
$$ R = \frac{2 v_0^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta}{g} - \frac{2 a v_0^2 \sin^2\theta}{g^2} $$  
Factor out $\frac{2 v_0^2 \sin\theta}{g}$:  
$$ R = \frac{2 v_0^2 \sin\theta}{g} \left( \cos\theta - \frac{a \sin\theta}{g} \right) $$  
This is the expression for the horizontal range.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{2 v_{0}^{2} \sin\theta}{g} \left( \cos\theta - \dfrac{a \sin\theta}{g} \right)}$$

## Problem 33

**Topic**: perfectly inelastic collision analysis (1)

**Thumbnail**: A 1500 kg car traveling east at 20 m/s collides with a 1000 kg car moving north at 15 m/s in a perfectly inelastic collision; determine the velocity vector of the wreckage.

### Problem

In a physics demonstration, two robotic carts collide on a frictionless horizontal surface. Cart A has mass $m_1$ and moves east at speed $v_1$. Cart B has mass $m_2$ and moves north at speed $v_2$. They undergo a perfectly inelastic collision and stick together. Determine the velocity vector of the combined object immediately after the collision.

Express your answer as an ordered pair of the form $(V_x, V_y)$, where $V_x$ is the east component and $V_y$ is the north component, in terms of the variables $m_1$, $m_2$, $v_1$, and $v_2$.

### Solution

The total momentum of the system is conserved in the collision because there are no external forces. We analyze the momentum components along the east-west (x-axis) and north-south (y-axis) directions.

**Initial momentum:**
- East component ($x$-direction): Only cart A contributes.  
  $p_{i,x} = m_1 v_1$
- North component ($y$-direction): Only cart B contributes.  
  $p_{i,y} = m_2 v_2$

**Final momentum:**  
After the collision, the combined mass is $m_1 + m_2$ and moves with velocity $\vec{V} = (V_x, V_y)$. Thus:
- $p_{f,x} = (m_1 + m_2) V_x$
- $p_{f,y} = (m_1 + m_2) V_y$

**Conservation of momentum in the $x$-direction:**  
$p_{i,x} = p_{f,x}$  
$m_1 v_1 = (m_1 + m_2) V_x$  
Solving for $V_x$:  
$$ V_x = \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2} $$

**Conservation of momentum in the $y$-direction:**  
$p_{i,y} = p_{f,y}$  
$m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) V_y$  
Solving for $V_y$:  
$$ V_y = \frac{m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2} $$

The velocity vector is $(V_x, V_y)$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{ \left( \dfrac{ m_1 v_1 }{ m_1 + m_2 }, \dfrac{ m_2 v_2 }{ m_1 + m_2 } \right) }$$

## Problem 34

**Topic**: Charles law volume-temperature relationships (3)

**Thumbnail**: At what Celsius temperature will a gas's volume double from its volume at 0¬∞C under constant pressure?

### Problem

A gas is confined in a cylinder with a movable piston that maintains constant pressure. At 0¬∞C, the gas occupies a volume $V_0$. Using the conversion between Celsius and Kelvin scales (where $T_{\mathrm{K}} = T_{\mathrm{C}} + 273.15$), determine the Celsius temperature at which the gas volume becomes $2V_0$. Express your final answer as a numerical value without including the unit symbol (degrees Celsius).

### Solution

**Step 1: State Charles's Law**  
Charles's law states that for a fixed amount of gas at constant pressure, volume $V$ is proportional to absolute temperature $T_{\mathrm{K}}$:  
$$ \frac{V_1}{T_{1,\mathrm{K}}} = \frac{V_2}{T_{2,\mathrm{K}}} $$  
where temperatures must be in Kelvin.

**Step 2: Define Initial Conditions**  
Initial volume $V_1 = V_0$ at initial Celsius temperature $T_{1,\mathrm{C}} = 0$. Convert to Kelvin:  
$$ T_{1,\mathrm{K}} = T_{1,\mathrm{C}} + 273.15 = 0 + 273.15 = 273.15  \text{K} $$

**Step 3: Define Final Conditions**  
Final volume $V_2 = 2V_0$. Let $T_{2,\mathrm{C}}$ be the unknown Celsius temperature. Convert to Kelvin:  
$$ T_{2,\mathrm{K}} = T_{2,\mathrm{C}} + 273.15  \text{K} $$

**Step 4: Apply Charles's Law**  
Substitute into the proportionality:  
$$ \frac{V_0}{273.15} = \frac{2V_0}{T_{2,\mathrm{C}} + 273.15} $$

**Step 5: Solve for $T_{2,\mathrm{C}}$**  
Divide both sides by $V_0$ (assuming $V_0 \neq 0$):  
$$ \frac{1}{273.15} = \frac{2}{T_{2,\mathrm{C}} + 273.15} $$  
Cross-multiply:  
$$ T_{2,\mathrm{C}} + 273.15 = 2 \times 273.15 $$  
$$ T_{2,\mathrm{C}} + 273.15 = 546.30 $$  
Isolate $T_{2,\mathrm{C}}$:  
$$ T_{2,\mathrm{C}} = 546.30 - 273.15 = 273.15 $$  
The Celsius temperature is 273.15.

### Answer

$$\boxed{273.15}$$

## Problem 35

**Topic**: Malus law intensity calculations (0)

**Thumbnail**: Unpolarized light of intensity $I_0$ passes through two polarizers with transmission axes at 30¬∞; find transmitted intensity.

### Problem

In a laboratory studying polarized light, unpolarized laser light with an intensity of $I_0$ is passed through two linear polarizers. The first polarizer has its transmission axis aligned vertically. The second polarizer is rotated such that its transmission axis makes an angle $\theta$ (in radians) with the vertical direction. Derive an expression for the intensity of the light transmitted through the second polarizer. Express your answer in terms of $I_0$ and $\theta$.

**Answer Format Instructions**  
- Express the transmitted intensity as a single analytic expression using only the symbols $I_0$ and $\theta$.  
- Use `\cos` for cosine and `\theta` for the angle.  
- Write the cosine squared term as `\cos^{2}\theta`.  
- Use `\frac{}{}` for fractions.  
- Do not include any units in the final answer.

### Solution

**Step 1: Intensity after the first polarizer**  
Unpolarized light has equal components of polarization in all directions. When it passes through a linear polarizer, the intensity is reduced by half, regardless of the orientation of the transmission axis. The transmitted light becomes linearly polarized along the transmission axis of the first polarizer. Therefore, after the first polarizer (vertical transmission axis), the intensity is:  
$$ I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} $$  
The light is now vertically polarized.

**Step 2: Intensity after the second polarizer**  
The vertically polarized light from the first polarizer is incident on the second polarizer. The transmission axis of the second polarizer is at an angle $\theta$ (in radians) to the vertical. Malus's law states that when polarized light of intensity $I_1$ passes through a polarizer, the transmitted intensity $I_2$ is given by:  
$$ I_2 = I_1 \cos^{2} \phi $$  
where $\phi$ is the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer. Here, the incident light is polarized vertically, and the transmission axis of the second polarizer is at angle $\theta$ to the vertical, so $\phi = \theta$. Substituting $I_1$ from Step 1:  
$$ I_2 = \left( \frac{I_0}{2} \right) \cos^{2} \theta $$  

**Conclusion**  
The intensity of the light transmitted through the second polarizer is $\dfrac{I_0}{2} \cos^{2} \theta$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{I_{0}}{2}\cos^{2}\theta}$$

## Problem 36

**Topic**: energy method problem solving (0)

**Thumbnail**: A block of mass $m$ slides from rest down a frictionless incline of height $h$; find its speed at the bottom using energy conservation.

### Problem

A block of mass $m$ is released from rest at the top of a fixed frictionless incline of height $h$. At the bottom of the incline, the block encounters a horizontal frictionless surface. Attached to the end of this surface is a massless spring with spring constant $k$, fixed to a rigid wall. Find the maximum compression of the spring when the block collides with it. 

Express the maximum compression $x$ in terms of the given parameters $m$, $g$, $h$, and $k$.

### Solution

The system is conservative, so mechanical energy is conserved. The initial total mechanical energy equals the final total mechanical energy. Choose the gravitational potential energy reference point as the horizontal surface at the bottom of the incline.

**Initial state (block at top of incline):**
- Gravitational potential energy: $m g h$
- Kinetic energy: $0$ (released from rest)
- Spring potential energy: $0$ (spring uncompressed)
- Total energy: $E_i = m g h$

**State at maximum spring compression:**
- Gravitational potential energy: $0$ (at reference height)
- Kinetic energy: $0$ (block momentarily at rest)
- Spring potential energy: $\frac{1}{2} k x^2$ (maximum compression $x$)
- Total energy: $E_f = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$

By conservation of energy:
$$E_i = E_f$$
$$m g h = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$$

Solve for $x$:
$$x^2 = \frac{2 m g h}{k}$$
$$x = \sqrt{\frac{2 m g h}{k}}$$

The expression is positive since compression is a magnitude. Thus, the maximum compression is $\sqrt{\frac{2 m g h}{k}}$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{2mgh}{k}}}$$

## Problem 37

**Topic**: magnetic force on current-carrying wires (3)

**Thumbnail**: A 0.5 kg horizontal wire of length 1 m is suspended in a 0.6 T perpendicular magnetic field; find the current needed to levitate it against gravity.

### Problem

A horizontal wire of mass $m$ and length $L$ is suspended in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the wire and oriented such that the magnetic force can act vertically. Determine the magnitude of the current $I$ that must flow through the wire to levitate it against Earth's gravitational acceleration $g$. Express your answer solely in terms of the given symbols $m$, $L$, $B$, and $g$.

### Solution

The magnetic force on a straight current-carrying wire is given by:
$$ F_{\text{mag}} = I L B \sin \theta $$
where $\theta$ is the angle between the wire and the magnetic field. Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the wire, $\theta = 90^\circ$ and $\sin 90^\circ = 1$. Thus:
$$ F_{\text{mag}} = I L B $$

The weight of the wire acts downward with magnitude:
$$ F_{\text{grav}} = m g $$

For the wire to levitate, the upward magnetic force must balance the downward gravitational force:
$$ F_{\text{mag}} = F_{\text{grav}} $$
Substituting the expressions:
$$ I L B = m g $$

Solving for the current $I$:
$$ I = \frac{m g}{L B} $$
This is the magnitude of the current required for levitation.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{m g}{L B}}$$

## Problem 38

**Topic**: velocity-time relationships in free fall (1)

**Thumbnail**: A stone thrown vertically upward at 20 m/s; determine when its velocity becomes zero.

### Problem

A stone is thrown vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of magnitude $v_0$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$, directed downward. Assume no air resistance and a constant gravitational acceleration.

Derive an expression for the time $t$ at which the stone's instantaneous velocity becomes zero. Express your answer solely in terms of $v_0$ and $g$.

### Solution

We use a coordinate system where the upward direction is positive. The initial velocity is $u = v_0$ (positive since it is upward). The acceleration due to gravity acts downward, so $a = -g$.

The velocity $v$ at time $t$ for motion under constant acceleration is given by:  
$$ v = u + at $$  
Substitute the known values:  
$$ v = v_0 + (-g)t $$  
$$ v = v_0 - gt $$  

Set $v = 0$ to find the time when the velocity becomes zero:  
$$ 0 = v_0 - gt $$  

Solve for $t$:  
$$ gt = v_0 $$  
$$ t = \frac{v_0}{g} $$  

Thus, the time at which the velocity becomes zero is $\frac{v_0}{g}$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{v_0}{g}}$$

## Problem 39

**Topic**: work function and threshold frequency (0)

**Thumbnail**: Calculate the work function of a metal in electron volts if the threshold wavelength is $400 \text{ nm}$.

### Problem

The threshold wavelength for a certain metal is denoted by $\lambda_0$. Using the principles of the photoelectric effect, derive an expression for the work function $\phi$ of this metal in electron volts (eV) in terms of $\lambda_0$ and the fundamental constants: Planck's constant $h$, the speed of light $c$, and the elementary charge $e$.

Express your answer as a single analytic expression. Do not substitute numerical values for any constants. Use standard notation: fractions must be written with two fields (e.g., $\frac{a}{b}$), and exponents must use curly braces (e.g., $x^{2}$).

### Solution

The work function $\phi$ is defined as the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal surface. In the photoelectric effect, this energy corresponds to the energy of a photon at the threshold wavelength $\lambda_0$, where the maximum kinetic energy of emitted electrons is zero.  

The energy $E$ of a photon with wavelength $\lambda_0$ is given by:  
$$ E = \frac{h c}{\lambda_0} $$  
Since this energy equals the work function when $\lambda = \lambda_0$:  
$$ \phi_{\text{joules}} = \frac{h c}{\lambda_0} $$  
where $\phi_{\text{joules}}$ is the work function in joules.  

To convert joules to electron volts (eV), divide by the elementary charge $e$ (since $1 \text{ eV} = e \text{ J}$):  
$$ \phi_{\text{eV}} = \frac{\phi_{\text{joules}}}{e} = \frac{\frac{h c}{\lambda_0}}{e} $$  
Simplifying the expression:  
$$ \phi_{\text{eV}} = \frac{h c}{e \lambda_0} $$  
This is the work function in electron volts.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{h c}{\lambda_{0} e}}$$

## Problem 40

**Topic**: Lorentz force and particle motion (1)

**Thumbnail**: An electron passes undeflected through crossed E (1.5 kV/m) and B (0.03 T) fields; determine its velocity.

### Problem

An electron moves through a region of space with uniform, constant, and mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. The electron is traveling in a direction perpendicular to both fields and passes through without any deflection. Derive an expression for the speed $v$ of the electron in terms of the magnitudes of the electric field $E$ and the magnetic field $B$.

### Solution

For the electron to pass undeflected, the net force acting on it must be zero. The Lorentz force law gives the total force on a charged particle as:

$$ \vec{F} = q\vec{E} + q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) $$

where $q$ is the charge of the electron. Setting the net force to zero:

$$ q\vec{E} + q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = 0 $$

Dividing by $q$ (since $q \neq 0$):

$$ \vec{E} + (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = 0 \quad (1) $$


Choose a coordinate system where the electric field $\vec{E}$ is along the positive $y$-axis and the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is along the positive $z$-axis:

$$ \vec{E} = E \hat{j}, \quad \vec{B} = B \hat{k} $$

Since the electron moves perpendicular to both fields, its velocity $\vec{v}$ has no $y$- or $z$-component and lies along the $x$-axis:

$$ \vec{v} = v \hat{i} $$


Compute the cross product $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$:

$$ \vec{v} \times \vec{B} = (v \hat{i}) \times (B \hat{k}) = vB (\hat{i} \times \hat{k}) $$

The cross product $\hat{i} \times \hat{k} = -\hat{j}$, so:

$$ \vec{v} \times \vec{B} = -vB \hat{j} $$


Substitute $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$ into equation (1):

$$ E \hat{j} + (-vB \hat{j}) = 0 $$


$$ (E - vB) \hat{j} = 0 $$

This implies:

$$ E - vB = 0 $$

Solving for $v$:

$$ v = \frac{E}{B} $$


The charge $q$ cancels out in the derivation, so the result holds for the electron despite its negative charge. The speed $v$ is independent of the particle's charge and mass.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\frac{E}{B}}$$

## Problem 41

**Topic**: combined translational and rotational motion (0)

**Thumbnail**: A solid sphere of mass $m$ and radius $r$ rolls without slipping down a $30^\circ$ incline; find its acceleration.

### Problem

A solid sphere of mass $m$ and radius $r$ rolls without slipping down an inclined plane. The inclined plane makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. Derive an expression for the linear acceleration of the center of mass of the sphere along the incline. Express your answer in terms of $g$ (the acceleration due to gravity), $\theta$, and any necessary mathematical constants.

Note: The moment of inertia of a solid sphere about its center of mass is $\frac{2}{5} m r^{2}$.

### Solution

The forces acting on the sphere are gravity, the normal force, and the friction force. The component of gravity parallel to the incline is $mg \sin\theta$, directed down the incline. The friction force $f$ acts up the incline (opposing the motion). 

Apply Newton's second law for translation along the incline (positive direction down the incline):

$$ mg \sin\theta - f = m a \quad (1) $$

where $a$ is the linear acceleration of the center of mass.

For rotation about the center of mass, the friction force provides a torque. The torque magnitude is $f r$ (lever arm equals radius). The rotational equation is:

$$ \tau = I \alpha $$
$$ f r = \left( \frac{2}{5} m r^{2} \right) \alpha \quad (2) $$

where $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration. The condition for rolling without slipping is:

$$ a = r \alpha \quad (3) $$

Solve equation (2) for $f$:

$$ f r = \frac{2}{5} m r^{2} \alpha $$
$$ f = \frac{2}{5} m r \alpha $$

Substitute $\alpha$ from equation (3) ($\alpha = a / r$):

$$ f = \frac{2}{5} m r \cdot \frac{a}{r} = \frac{2}{5} m a $$

Substitute this expression for $f$ into equation (1):

$$ mg \sin\theta - \frac{2}{5} m a = m a $$

Divide both sides by $m$ (assuming $m \neq 0$):

$$ g \sin\theta - \frac{2}{5} a = a $$

Combine like terms:

$$ g \sin\theta = a + \frac{2}{5} a = \frac{7}{5} a $$

Solve for $a$:

$$ a = \frac{5}{7} g \sin\theta $$

Thus, the linear acceleration of the center of mass is $\dfrac{5}{7} g \sin\theta$.

### Answer

$$\boxed{\dfrac{5}{7} g \sin\theta}$$
